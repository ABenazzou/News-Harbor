https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67914727,Suspected Israeli strike in Lebanon kills senior Hezbollah commander,The Lebanese group Hezbollah says one of its commanders has been killed in a strike in southern Lebanon believed to have been carried out by Israel.,2024-01-09,"The Lebanese group Hezbollah says one of its commanders has been killed in a strike in southern Lebanon believed to have been carried out by Israel. Wissam Tawil was reportedly a member of the group's elite Radwan Force, and one of the most prominent Hezbollah figures to be killed in the current violence. Israel's military did not comment, but it did say it had hit Hezbollah targets in response to cross-border attacks. The clashes have raised fears of a wider regional conflict. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed group that wields considerable military and political power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers. Its fighters have exchanged fire with Israeli forces almost every day along the border since the start of the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip on 7 October. Israel's prime minister told soldiers stationed on the border with Lebanon on Monday that he was determined to ""do everything necessary to restore security to the north"". Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that two people - whom it did not name - were killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a car in the al-Dabsha area of Khirbet Selim at around 10:15 (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The strike caused the vehicle to veer off the road and catch fire, it added. Pictures from the scene showed the burned-out wreck of a car on a roadside. Lebanese security sources said one of those killed in the strike was Wissam Tawil and that the other was also a Hezbollah fighter. Three sources told Reuters news agency that Tawil was the deputy head of a unit within Hezbollah's Radwan Force, whose well-trained members are considered the group's special forces. AFP news agency meanwhile cited another source as saying that Tawil ""had a leading role in managing Hezbollah's operations in the south"" of Lebanon. Later, Hezbollah issued a statement announcing Tawil's death and describing him as a ""commander"". It did not confirm that he was killed in a strike, saying only that he ""rose as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem"". The statement provided no details about Tawil's role in Hezbollah, but the group published photos showing him shaking hands with its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and sitting next the late Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US strike in Iraq in 2020. The group also announced that its fighters had fired at Israeli forces in the Shtoula area of northern Israel and in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area in the occupied Golan Heights. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it would not comment on foreign media reports about Tawil's death. However, not long after the incident in Khirbet Selim it put out a statement saying that it ""struck a number of areas in Lebanese territory"" after an anti-tank missile was launched towards the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. ""Additionally, [Israeli Air Force] fighter jets struck a series of Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon, including military sites in which Hezbollah terrorists operated,"" it added. On Monday afternoon, the IDF said a jet carried out another series of strikes after an aerial defence array intercepted a ""suspicious aerial target"" that crossed from Lebanon, triggering sirens in the Kfar Blum area. An Israeli soldier was also lightly injured by an anti-tank missile that was fired towards Mount Dov, it added. Over the weekend, the IDF's chief spokesman said it had targeted significant military assets of Hezbollah and carried out ""damaging"" strikes on the Radwan Force in an effort to drive them away from the border. It came after a rocket and missile barrage launched from Lebanon damaged an air traffic control base on Mount Meron. The cross-border violence over the past three months has already killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters, as well as several Israeli soldiers and Israeli and Lebanese civilians. But so far, Hezbollah has calibrated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel. Last week, reacting to a suspected Israeli strike that killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri and six other people in Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah warned Israeli authorities against starting a conflict. ""Whoever thinks of war with us... he will regret it,"" he said. However, crucially, there was no threat from Hezbollah's leader to escalate its actions. Many in Lebanon still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 and, with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is no public support for any military confrontation. Miscalculation, however, is always a risk. And, in Israel, some senior figures have touted a potential larger offensive against Hezbollah to reduce the threat posed by the group and allow the return of thousands of residents who have been evacuated because of constant attacks. ""We'll create a completely different reality [in the north], or we'll get to another war,"" IDF chief of staff Lt Gen Herzl Halevi said on Sunday. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told soldiers at a base in Kiryat Shmona that he wanted to ""send a message to Hezbollah"". ""Hezbollah made a big mistake with us in 2006 and it is also doing so now. It thought that we were like 'spider's cobwebs'. Suddenly, it sees what kind of 'spider'. It sees great force here, the unity of the people, the determination to do everything necessary to restore security to the north,"" he said. ""Of course, we prefer that this be done without a wide-ranging campaign, but that will not stop us,"" he added. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who has been meeting Arab leaders on his latest regional tour, has been trying to de-escalate tensions. He is also expected to call for Israel to reduce the intensity of its fighting in Gaza amid reports of dozens of Palestinians killed in the latest air strikes.","['Lebanon', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Israel', 'Hezbollah']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E8F3/production/_132253695_mediaitem132253694.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/129D5/production/_132254267_israel_lebanon_map_v5_2x640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16CA1/production/_132254339_gettyimages-1899081081.jpg']","['Hugo Bachega', 'David Gritten']",Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67907336,Palestinians must be able to stay in Gaza - Blinken,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow.",2024-01-09,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow. Mr Blinken condemned statements by some Israeli ministers, who called for the resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere. The US official was in Qatar on his latest Middle East tour. His comments followed reports that up to 70 people were killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. Footage from Jabalia showed bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building - many of them women and children. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it ""acted against a military target in the strike"" and that it was ""not aware of the number of casualties mentioned"". ""In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,"" they said, adding that the IDF ""follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"". More than 60 Palestinians were reportedly also killed in the past day in the southern city of Khan Younis. Jabalia camp has been struck many times since Israel began its war against Hamas following the unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October. Some 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage in the Hamas raids. More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has reported at least 113 deaths over 24 hours of Israeli bombardment. ""Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,"" Mr Blinken said on Sunday. ""They cannot, they must not be pressed to leave Gaza."" Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"". And National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right politician, this week issued a call ""to encourage the migration of Gaza residents"" as a ""solution"" to the crisis. The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Health officials said even medical facilities including hospitals are now unsafe. Three international medical aid groups announced they were pulling out of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza after Israel issued evacuation orders. A representative of the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that they were ""hugely concerned by this development"". ""What it means is that a hospital that was already over-crowded and overloaded and well beyond its capacity is now without absolutely critical reinforcement to support it as it deals with an ever-increasing number of casualties,"" said Gemma Connell. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that more than 600 patients and health workers were forced to leave the hospital, according to its director. ""Their locations are not currently known,"" said Mr Tedros in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Mr Blinken's latest trip to the Middle East comes amid rising tensions in the region, with concerns that the war in Gaza could spread. Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas official, was assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement in Lebanon, described Arouri's assassination as a ""flagrant Israeli aggression"" that would not go unpunished. Hezbollah then fired rockets into Israel on Saturday as a ""preliminary response"" to the killing of Arouri. ""This is a moment of profound tension in the region. This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Mr Blinken said. Qatar's PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al -Thani said that the killing of Arouri had affected ""the complicated process"". Mr Blinken also said that the death of journalist Hamza al-Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza., was ""an unimaginable tragedy"". He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war. Mr Blinken arrived in Qatar following stops in Jordan, Turkey and Greece. He went on to Abu Dhabi late Sunday, and on Monday is due to travel to Saudi Arabia.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Middle East', 'Gaza', 'Palestinian territories', 'Hamas', 'Israel', 'Israel & the Palestinians', 'Antony Blinken', 'Hezbollah']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16F00/production/_132225939_mediaitem132225938.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/60B8/production/_132206742_mediaitem132205151.jpg']",['George Wright'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67921167,'I cannot sleep in peace' - Israelis fearful as Hezbollah tensions soar,Efrat Eldan Schechter is a native of the Northern Galilee and never even considered moving anywhere else to bring up her family - that is until the events of 7 October.,2024-01-09,"Efrat Eldan Schechter is a native of the Northern Galilee and never even considered moving anywhere else to bring up her family - that is until the events of 7 October. When she heard and watched reports of what was happening in southern Israel that morning, as heavily armed Hamas gunmen streamed out of Gaza, she was immediately taken back to stories from the ""Yom Kippur"" or 1973 Middle East war, when Israel was attacked simultaneously on two fronts. ""I was terrified. Everyone was sleeping in and I thought it's going to be '73 all over again and Hezbollah is coming for us too,"" says Efrat, as our interview in her front garden is punctuated by the regular loud thud of outgoing Israeli artillery fire. ""Immediately, I woke everyone up and very quickly got everything together and drove to a relative's house in the centre of Israel."" After a month the family returned to their house near Kiryat Shmona, frustrated because they're still living on the edge of a war zone - a ""buffer zone"" as Efrat calls it - well within range of Hezbollah rockets being fired from southern Lebanon. ""What we fear most is that nothing will be done because Hezbollah are just waiting there on the border to come in and invade Israel,"" says the mother-of-three. ""I cannot sleep in peace. I want my government to make sure that we have real security here. If it is necessary, they should act and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon."" Ever since violence here erupted on 8 October, when Hezbollah fired rockets and artillery ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinians, and Israel fired back, clashes in the north are generally confined to a three- or four-mile-wide (5-6km) strip along the entire border. But they are intense and deadly - nine soldiers and four civilians have been killed in Israel, officials say, while authorities in Lebanon have reported that 123 people have been killed, including at least 21 civilians. The frontier communities of northern Israel are today like ghost towns. More than 80,000 residents have been evacuated to centres further south, but Nissan Zeevi is one of the few who has stayed. The businessman, and civil defence member, shows me around his kibbutz - Kfar Giladi, just north of Kiryat Shmona. The scenery is beguiling as you look out over the lush, green Hula valley and Mount Hermon in the distance, but this border has always been volatile. Like Efrat, Nissan does not believe most people can return to their homes and businesses until there is a guarantee of a lasting peace. He is particularly frustrated that UN Security Council resolution 1701, which helped end the 2006 Lebanon war between Israel and Hezbollah has not been fully implemented. Crucially, says Nissan, 1701 calls for the demilitarisation of armed groups (specifically Hezbollah) in southern Lebanon. And that, clearly, has not been achieved. Nissan is part of Lobby 1701, which has called for the implementation of the resolution ""whether through diplomatic means or through a military action by Israel"". ""What we are demanding from our government is to take care of Hezbollah, to demolish the threat coming from those areas of southern Lebanon,"" he tells me, as he points out the many Lebanese villages he can see from his own home and from where, he says, much of the incoming fire emanates. When I ask him if he would support even more action by the Israeli government in southern Lebanon, Nissan says: ""Absolutely! It's not only me. A big proportion of the population of Israel is demanding the same."" ""If we don't do this, we will end up with another 7 October,"" he adds. Last month, I travelled to those very same frontier villages in southern Lebanon. They're being hit daily by strikes because Israel says Hezbollah is hiding in communities to launch rockets and sophisticated weapons. Just as on the Israeli side, tens of thousands of people have left these areas too, and many have been killed. There's loss on both sides of the border. The possibility that this ""contained"" border conflict will escalate into a full-scale war came even closer on Monday with the apparent assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander, Wissam Tawil, when his car was hit in an air strike in Khirbet Selim. Last week, it is widely believed that Israel was also responsible for a drone strike in a Hezbollah stronghold in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, that killed Hamas's deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri. None of this is good news for those trying to make a living near the front line. Farmer Ofer ""Poshko"" Moskovitz of Kibbutz Misgav Am can't bring in the kibbutz's valuable avocado crop because the Israeli army says it's too dangerous for him to spend time in his orchards, which are right up against the Lebanese border, north-west of Kiryat Shmona. But, unlike many I spoke to in the north, this phlegmatic and jovial farmer does think a wider war can be averted. ""I'm not worried, because Israel is a strong country,"" says Ofer as we wade our way through hundreds upon hundreds of almost ripe, green avocados strewn across the ground. He continues: ""Nobody is looking for war here. We prefer to do it in a diplomatic way and they are looking for a solution - both the army and diplomatic efforts together."" Ofer's cautious positivity is in short supply in these parts. Sarit Zahavi, who also lives close to the border, is the founder of the Alma Research Institute in northern Israel and spends much of her time analysing political developments among Israel's regional neighbours. ""We are facing a very dangerous situation, in the sense that if there is to be a diplomatic arrangement, it would mean a ceasefire. And everybody will think that is good news,"" she tells me. ""But, for me, if there will be a ceasefire, nobody will enforce the arrangement. Then Hezbollah will continue to grow, and will continue to develop its capabilities to invade Israel."" Fewer people, at least in northern Israel, seem to be confident that diplomacy can now avert a wider war. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has already vowed to retaliate for Israel's actions and, Israel too, seems to be preparing for the possibility of an escalation. On Monday, Israel carried out some of the heaviest bombing so far along its northern border just as the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv. With the devastating war in Gaza and the latest developments in the north, the challenge for Secretary Blinken seems almost impossible.","['Lebanon', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Israel', 'Hezbollah']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2C5/production/_132256754_efrateldanschechter2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/129D5/production/_132254267_israel_lebanon_map_v5_2x640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1365/production/_132256940_nissanzeevi2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/84AD/production/_132256933_fe7715125755c13edc15b1b66eab8c7dff329a92.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8BB5/production/_132256753_ofer_poshko_moskovitz3.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/120ED/production/_132256937_c50161e578fb0f3023ec7e74d19d694274ff71f3.jpg']",['Wyre Davies'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-67915770,High number of civilians hurt by explosives in 2023,"Last year saw the highest number of civilian casualties killed or injured by explosives in more than a decade, according to new research.",2024-01-09,"Last year saw the highest number of civilian casualties killed or injured by explosives in more than a decade, according to new research. The UK-based charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) recorded a 122% percent increase in civilian fatalities caused by explosives in 2023. The rise is largely due to the war being fought between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Conflicts in Ukraine, Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia also contributed. AOAV is a London based charity which records and monitors evidence of armed violence against civilians worldwide. Its reporting and analysis is used by international forums such as the UN. It has also presented its evidence to the UK's Parliament. In 2023, AOAV identified at least 7,307 explosive incidents around the globe, up from 4,322 recorded the previous year. The attacks caused the deaths of at least 15,305 civilians, accounting for a rise of 122% from 2022. Tens of thousands more were injured. AOAV describes Israel's war in Gaza as ""a major cause for such a dramatic increase"" in civilian casualties, accounting for around one third of the global total. It recorded 920 incidents of explosive weapons use in Gaza, resulting in 9,334 people being killed. That is lower than other estimates. AOAV says its data does not capture all harm, but does highlight clear trends in explosive violence. It says the data includes reports from reputable media organisations. Israel's military operation, which began on 7 October in response to the Hamas attacks, also contributed to a huge increase in the number of air strikes recorded, the charity said. AOAV says the use of air-launched weapons across the globe increased by 226% in 2023 - rising from 519 incidents in 2022 to 1,694 last year. Israel has repeatedly stated it has taken unprecedented steps to avoid civilian casualties, including issuing warnings in advance of air strikes. But AOAV's research shows that when explosive weapons are used in populated areas, the vast majority of those injured are likely to be civilians. AOAV's director, Iain Overton, says its data should be a stark warning to states that using explosive weapons in urban areas disproportionately impacts civilians. The charity also recorded a significant increase in the use of ground-launched weapons in 2023. Across the globe state actors were responsible for 77% of the civilian casualties caused by explosives. AOAV says Israel ""was by far the most injurious state actor in 2023"", with more than 1,000 attacks leading to 12,950 civilian casualties - dead and injured. Russia was second, with its war in Ukraine causing 8,351 civilian casualties. Ongoing conflicts in Sudan, Myanmar, Syria and Somalia also contributed to the highest civilian casualties recorded by AOAV since 2010. Non-state actors, including militants and proscribed groups, were also behind the increase in the use of explosive weapons last year. However, AOAV recorded the number of civilians killed by non-state actors as falling by 8%.","['Myanmar', 'Russia', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'War in Ukraine', 'Gaza', 'Sudan', 'Ukraine', 'Somalia', 'Israel']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10A27/production/_132253186_gettyimages-1908927995.jpg'],['Jonathan Beale'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67911825,Antony Blinken: On the US mission to stop Gaza igniting wider war,"Of all the priorities for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his fourth visit to the Middle East in three months, there is one message above all others that he wants to deliver.",2024-01-09,"Of all the priorities for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his fourth visit to the Middle East in three months, there is one message above all others that he wants to deliver. His main mission on this trip is to ensure the Israel-Gaza war does not spread into a regional conflict. As he flies between destinations in southwest Asia - a packed schedule that includes stops in Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel - there is ample evidence, however, that the cauldron of tensions in the region is on the verge of boiling over. Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched repeated missile and drone attacks on civilian shipping in the Red Sea, bringing traffic through that key international waterway to a near halt. The US has warned that it will defend its interests. If the rebels persist, and the disruption to global commerce continues, an American military response may be inevitable - a development that would unnerve some key American Arab allies. ""We never see a military action as a resolution,"" said the Qatari prime minister in a joint press conference with Mr Blinken in Doha on Sunday. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said his biggest worry was that such action would ""keep us in a loop that will never end and will create a real tension in the entire region"". On Saturday, Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon fired a barrage of rocket attacks on northern Israel in reprisal for what appeared to be an Israeli-planned bomb attack that killed a key Hamas leader in Beirut. Israel responded with air strikes targeting Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. An escalation there, Mr Blinken said later that day, was a ""real concern"". He called on regional powers with influence over Hezbollah - in other words Iran and, to a lesser extent, Turkey - to use their influence to ""try to keep things in check"". That may be difficult. As the Washington Post reported, American officials are concerned that Israel may be considering a more expansive offensive against Hezbollah. ""We prefer the path of an agreed-upon diplomatic settlement, but we are getting close to the point where the hourglass will turn over,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday. Meanwhile, US military installations have been hit by rocket and drone attacks from militants in Iraq and Syria, where more than 3,000 American soldiers are stationed. In late October, a drone breached US defences and struck a barracks but did not detonate, according to a Reuters report, narrowly avoiding what might have been significant American casualties. The US has responded with military action, including an air strike in Baghdad last week that killed Mushtaq Taleb al-Saidi, an Iran-backed militia leader. Each of these episodes, taken individually, presents a threat to regional stability. When viewed as a whole, it suggests a Middle East teetering on the brink of wider war. In Qatar on Sunday, Mr Blinken said the US has a plan to address the growing instability - and it hinges on winding down the Israeli military campaign in Gaza and working with Arab nations and the Israelis to establish a ""durable"" peace for the Palestinians. ""The United States has a vision for how to get there, a regional approach that delivers lasting security for Israel and a state for the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""And my takeaway from the discussions so far ... is that our partners are willing to have these difficult conversations and to make hard decisions."" Therein lies the rub. After meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, Mr Blinken said he's seen a willingness to help stabilise and revitalise a post-war Gaza among all the leaders he's spoken with so far. But the US has to get Israel on board. The timing of Mr Blinken's latest Middle East trip may give hints of the American strategy in this latest round of shuttle diplomacy. His early visits to Turkey and Arab nations before two days in Israel have allowed the secretary to take the temperature of regional players before sitting down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet. Then the ball, as Americans like to say, is in the Israeli court. ""I'll have an opportunity to share with Israeli leaders everything I've heard thus far on this trip,"" he said on Monday. ""I'm convinced that there is a future path that can actually bring lasting peace and security for Israel."" Behind all this is an American gamble - that resolving, or at least winding down, the Gaza War will cool tensions throughout the region. It is a bet that the various mini-crises - in the Red Sea, in Lebanon, and in Iraq and Syria - have not taken on a momentum of their own. There is no peace in the region without a legitimate, peaceful solution to the Palestinian conflict, the Qatari prime minister said on Sunday. The question is, will there be peace with such a resolution? During his November trip to the Middle East, Mr Blinken told reporters gathered on the tarmac in Ankara, Turkey, that countries across the region do not want war - and are working to prevent the conflict from spreading. ""Sometimes the absence of something bad happening may not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is,"" the US secretary said. Since then, there has been ample evidence that while a wider war may not be wanted, the prospects for one has increased - despite the stated intentions and efforts of Mr Blinken and the Americans.","['United States', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Antony Blinken', 'Qatar']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4710/production/_132229181_blinken_976getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/929F/production/_132253573_houthis_976getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/447F/production/_132253571_funeral_976.jpg']",['Anthony Zurcher'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67905566,Al Jazeera bureau chief's son Hamza al-Dahdouh among journalists killed in Gaza,The eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief has been killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza.,2024-01-09,"The eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief has been killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza. Hamza al-Dahdouh, an Al Jazeera network journalist and cameraman, was driving in a car with other journalists along a road between Khan Younis and Rafah on Sunday when it was hit. Freelance journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed. A third journalist, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured. Four other members of bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh's family have been killed. His wife Amna, his grandchild Adam, his 15-year-old son Mahmoud and seven-year-old daughter Sham were killed in an Israeli strike in Nuseirat refugee camp in October. According to Al Jazeera correspondent Hisham Zaqout, Hamza al-Dahdouh and a group of journalists were en route to the Moraj area north-east of Rafah - which was designated a ""humanitarian zone"" by the Israeli army - but which had reportedly experienced recent bombings. Many displaced Gazans had fled to the area to escape the bombardment in other regions of the territory. Hamza had intended to report on the unfolding situation and the aftermath of the bombings in the area, according to Al Jazeera. In a statement to the BBC, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""An IDF aircraft identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops. ""We are aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit."" Live footage from Al Jazeera showed the aftermath of the strike on the car they had been travelling in. It also showed his father Wael al-Dahdouh in tears, holding his hand and standing next to his body in a morgue in Khan Younis. He was buried in the southern city of Rafah. ""Hamza was not just part of me. He was the whole of me. He was the soul of my soul. These are tears of sadness, of loss. These are tears of humanity,"" his father said at the funeral. ""I call on the world to look closely at what's happening in Gaza."" Wael al-Dahdouh was himself wounded and his cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa was killed in a separate strike while filming last month. Mr al-Dahdouh, who has eight children, continued reporting on the war in Gaza. Hamza al-Dahdouh had one million followers on Instagram. His final post before he was killed was about his father. ""You are steadfast and patient. Do not despair of God's mercy. Be certain that he will reward you,"" he said. The Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement that it ""strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces' targeting of Palestinian journalists' car"". ""The assassination of Mustafa and Hamza... whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty in the Gaza Strip, reaffirms the need to take immediate necessary legal measures against the occupation forces to ensure that there is no impunity,"" it added. It also alleged that the strike ""confirms without a doubt the Israeli forces' determination continue these brutal attacks against journalists and their families, aiming to discourage them from performing their mission, violating the principles of freedom of the press and undermines the right to life"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Hamza al-Dahdouh's death was ""an unimaginable tragedy"". He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the BBC's World This Weekend that ""Israel does not deliberately target journalists"". ""We're the only country in the Middle East that actually does have a free press. We're the only country in the entire region where the press can write bad things and criticise the leaders of government,"" he said. ""To say Israel deliberately targets the press is ridiculous, we're the only country that actually enshrines the free press."" More than 75 journalists have been killed since the war in Gaza started.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67914707,"Global economy set for weakest growth since pandemic, warns World Bank","The global economy is set to grow at its slowest pace since the pandemic, the World Bank has warned.",2024-01-09,"The global economy is set to grow at its slowest pace since the pandemic, the World Bank has warned. It has forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2024 and stated higher interest rates were a major factor. Global trade and investment would continue to be stifled by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, it said. Outside of the pandemic, growth of 2.4% would be the weakest since the 2009-09 financial crisis. It said the resilience of the US economy meant last year's growth was likely to come at 2.6%. Indermit Gill, chief economist, at the World Bank Group said: ""Near-term growth will remain weak, leaving many developing countries - especially the poorest - stuck in a trap"". Problems he explained include ""paralyzing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people."" Global growth is at historically ""mediocre"" levels and growth in global trade remains sluggish, he added. The twice yearly lookahead warned that fallout from the Israel Hamas conflict ""has sharply heightened geopolitical risks"". It said the disruption to key shipping routes caused by attacks on vessels in the Red Sea increased the likelihood of ""inflationary bottlenecks"". Political concern about rising prices was voiced by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on his ongoing tour to the region on Monday. He tweeted that the attacks ""have disrupted or diverted nearly 20% of global shipping. This increases the cost and time of moving food, fuel, medicine, and humanitarian assistance."" It comes at a time when central banks around the world are beginning to feel that they are getting on top of the cost living crisis. Nearly two years of steady increases in the cost of borrowing have brought inflation closer of the 2% target in the US, UK and Eurozone and rates cuts are widely expected this year. However those higher interest rates in the world's biggest economies also make borrowing more expensive in poorer countries and the World Bank is particularly concerned about how affordable that is for the world's 75 poorest countries. This is one way in which the report highlights that richer countries are recovering better from the pandemic than poorer nations. ""At the end of 2024 we project that all advanced economies will have a per capita income that is higher than what they had before COVID"" said Mr Gill. However he added the average income of an individual in an emerging economy will be 75% of the pre-covid level, while it could be as low as 66% in the poorest countries There is particular concern about the cost of food for the world's poorest people, especially given last year's 27% increase in the price of rice, which has been linked to India severely restricting exports. However ample supplies of other crops such as grains mean average food prices are set to fall 1% this year. There is another reminder that China, the world's second biggest economy, continues to be blighted by a reluctance for consumers to spend money in the shops which has led to prices falling. Combined with the vast debts in its troubled property sector the economy is forecast to grow just 4.5%. That would be the lowest in decades and even below the modest 5% target the government set for 2023. As well as foreign companies investing less some of this slowdown is because of longer-term trends such as an aging population and the difficulties in maintaining the pace of development seen over the last 20 years. ""That slowing growth in China presents a headwind to other developed economies, especially those for which China is a major trade partner,"" said Mr Gill. Overall the World Bank is forecasting that the five years to the end of 2024 will add up to the slowest half decade of global economic growth in 30 years. However there is optimism that the trend can be improved if governments do more to encourage the investments, particularly from the private sector, that will be needed to tackle challenges including climate change and the energy transition.","['Inflation', 'China economy', 'Shipping industry', 'US economy', 'US Federal Reserve', 'Economy', 'Global trade', 'Houthis', 'War in Ukraine', 'World Bank', 'Coronavirus', 'Global supply chain management', 'Suez canal', 'European Central Bank (ECB)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/671B/production/_132259362_gettyimages-1883757061.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16247/production/_132259609_gettyimages-1718800954.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C607/production/_132259605_gettyimages-1653043262.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CF89/production/_130592135_gettyimages-80455426-594x594.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1035B/production/_132259366_gettyimages-1900776964.jpg']",['Jonathan Josephs'],War in Ukraine,N/A
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67861954,2023 confirmed as world's hottest year on record,"The year 2023 has been confirmed as the warmest on record, driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather event.",2024-01-09,"The year 2023 has been confirmed as the warmest on record, driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather event. Last year was about 1.48C warmer than the long-term average before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the EU's climate service says. Almost every day since July has seen a new global air temperature high for the time of year, BBC analysis shows. Sea surface temperatures have also smashed previous highs. The Met Office reported last week that the UK experienced its second warmest year on record in 2023. These global records are bringing the world closer to breaching key international climate targets. ""What struck me was not just that [2023] was record-breaking, but the amount by which it broke previous records,"" notes Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&M University. The margin of some of these records - which you can see on the chart below - is ""really astonishing"", Prof Dessler says, considering they are averages across the whole world. It's well-known that the world is much warmer now than 100 years ago, as humans keep releasing record amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But 12 months ago, no major science body actually predicted 2023 being the hottest year on record, because of the complicated way in which the Earth's climate behaves. During the first few months of the year, only a small number of days broke air temperature records. But the world then went on a remarkable, almost unbroken streak of daily records in the second half of 2023. Look at the calendar chart below, where each block represents a day in 2023. Records were broken on the days coloured in the darkest shade of red. From June, we're looking at a new record most days. More than 200 days saw a new daily global temperature record for the time of year, according to BBC analysis of Copernicus Climate Change Service data. This recent temperature boost is mainly linked to the rapid switch to El Niño conditions, which has occurred on top of long-term human-caused warming. El Niño is a natural event where warmer surface waters in the East Pacific Ocean release additional heat into the atmosphere. But air temperatures have been boosted unusually early on in this El Niño phase - the full effects had not been expected until early 2024, after El Niño had reached maximum strength. This has left many scientists unsure about exactly what is going on with the climate. ""That raises a bunch of really interesting questions of why [2023 was] so warm,"" notes Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a science organisation in the US. Another notable feature of the 2023 warmth is that it has been felt pretty much worldwide. As the map below shows, almost all of the globe was warmer than recent 1991-2020 levels - a period that was itself nearly 0.9C warmer than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels in the late 1800s. This record global warmth has helped to worsen many extreme weather events across large parts of the world in 2023 - from intense heatwaves and wildfires across Canada and the US, to prolonged drought and then flooding in parts of east Africa. Many occurred on scales far beyond those seen in recent times, or at unusual points of the year. ""These are more than just statistics,"" says Prof Petteri Taalas, the Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization between 2016 and 2023. ""Extreme weather is destroying lives and livelihoods on a daily basis."" The temperature of the air is only one measure of the Earth's rapidly changing climate. Also in 2023: In fact, the world's ocean surface has been on an unbroken streak of record-breaking days since 4 May, BBC analysis of Copernicus data shows. As the chart below illustrates, many days have seen records broken by a huge margin. The year 2024 could be warmer than 2023 - as some of the record ocean surface heat escapes into the atmosphere - although the ""weird"" behaviour of the current El Niño means it's hard to be sure, Dr Hausfather says. It raises the possibility that 2024 may even surpass the key 1.5C warming threshold across the entire calendar year for the first time, according to the UK Met Office. Nearly 200 countries agreed in Paris in 2015 to try to limit warming to this level, to avoid the worst effects of global warming. It refers to long-term averages over 20 or 30 years, so a year-long breach in 2024 wouldn't mean the Paris agreement had been broken. But it highlights the concerning direction of travel, with each hot year bringing the world closer to passing 1.5C over the longer term. Human activities are behind this long-term global warming trend, even though natural factors like El Niño can raise or reduce temperatures for individual years, and the temperatures experienced in 2023 go far beyond simply natural causes. Look at the chart below. At the time, 1998 and 2016 were record-breaking years, boosted by strong El Niño warming. But these don't come close to the new 2023 records, marked in the darkest reds. ""2023 was an exceptional year, with climate records tumbling like dominoes,"" concludes Dr Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. This latest warning comes shortly after the COP28 climate summit, where countries agreed for the first time on the need to tackle the main cause of rising temperatures - fossil fuels. While the language of the deal was weaker than many wanted - with no obligation for countries to act - it's hoped that it will help to build on some recent encouraging progress in areas like renewable power and electric vehicles. This can still make a crucial difference to limit the consequences of climate change, researchers say, even though the 1.5C target looks likely to be missed. ""Even if we end up at 1.6C instead, it will be so much better than giving up and ending up close to 3C, which is where current policies would bring us,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London. ""Every tenth of a degree matters.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67893808,Deep-sea mining: Norway approves controversial practice,Norway has become the first country in the world to move forward with the controversial practice of commercial-scale deep-sea mining.,2024-01-09,"Norway has become the first country in the world to move forward with the controversial practice of commercial-scale deep-sea mining. The bill, passed on Tuesday, will accelerate the hunt for precious metals which are in high demand for green technologies. Environmental scientists have warned it could be devastating for marine life. The plan concerns Norwegian waters, but agreement on mining in international waters could also be reached this year. The Norwegian government said it was being cautious and would only begin issuing licences once further environmental studies were carried out. The deep sea hosts potato-sized rocks called nodules and crusts which contain minerals such as lithium, scandium and cobalt, critical for clean technologies, including in batteries. Norway's proposal will open up 280,000 sq km (108,000 sq miles) of its national waters for companies to apply to mine these sources - an area bigger than the size of the UK. Although these minerals are available on land, they are concentrated in a few countries, increasing the risk to supply. For example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, which holds some of the largest reserves of cobalt, faces conflict in parts of the country. Walter Sognnes, co-founder of Norwegian mining company Loke Minerals, which plans to apply for a licence recognised that more needs to be done to understand the deep ocean before mining begins. He told the BBC: ""We will have a relatively long period of exploration and mapping activity to close the knowledge gap on the environmental impact."" Martin Webeler, oceans campaigner and researcher at the Environmental Justice Foundation, said it is ""catastrophic"" for the ocean habitat. ""The Norwegian government always highlighted that they want to implement the highest environmental standards,"" he said. ""That is hypocritical whilst you are throwing away all the scientific advice."" He said that mining companies should focus on preventing environmental damage in current operations, rather than opening up a whole new industry. The move puts the country at odds with the EU and the UK, which have called for a temporary ban on the practice because of concerns about environmental damage. Techniques to harvest the minerals from the sea floor could generate significant noise and light pollution, as well as damage to the habitat of organisms relying on the nodules, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In November, in an unusual move, 120 EU lawmakers wrote an open letter calling on the Norwegian parliament to reject the project because of ""the risk of such activity to marine biodiversity and the acceleration of climate change"". The letter also said the impact assessment conducted by Norway had too many knowledge gaps. As well as external criticism, the Norwegian government has also faced pushback from its own experts. The Norway Institute of Marine Research (IMR) said that the government had made assumptions from a small area of research and applied it to the whole area planned for drilling. It estimates a further five to 10 years of research into impacts on species is needed. The Norwegian government will not immediately allow companies to start drilling. They will have to submit proposals, including environmental assessments, for a licence which will then be approved on a case-by-case basis by parliament. Marianne Sivertsen Næss, chair of The Standing Committee on Energy and the Environment, which considered the original plan, told the BBC that the Norwegian government was taking a ""precautionary approach to mineral activities"". She said: ""We do not currently have the knowledge needed to extract minerals from the seabed in the manner required. The government's proposal to open an area for activity enables private players to explore and acquire knowledge and data from the areas in question. Opening up areas is not the same as approving extraction of seabed minerals."" Mr Sognnes, of Loke Minerals, added that the government's plan would bring in much-needed investment from the private sector for research of deep marine environments. ""Develop[ing] knowledge on the deep ocean is very costly, you need to operate robots and these are very expensive and unfortunately the universities have limited access to these kind of tools,"" he said. He estimated that any actual extraction would not begin until the early 2030s. Campaigners argue that more investment should go into recycling and reusing the existing minerals we have mined on land. The Environmental Justice Foundation estimates in a report that 16,000 tonnes of cobalt per year, about 10% of annual production, could be recovered through improved collection and recycling of mobile phones. While Norway's proposal concerns its national waters, negotiations continue on whether licences could be issued for international seas. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) - a UN-affiliated body - will meet this year to try to finalise rules, with a final vote expected in 2025. More than 30 countries are in favour of a ban, but countries such as China are keen to see the ISA press on.","['Norway', 'Deep sea mining', 'Mining', 'Environment', 'Oceans', 'Marine conservation', 'Marine biology', 'Marine life']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10FA5/production/_132214596_gettyimages-170956321.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C185/production/_132214594_humpbackwhale2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/13BFC/production/_132229808_norwegian_mining_near_marine_areas_640-nc-2x-nc.png']",['Esme Stallard'],Climate,Climate Change
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24021772,What is climate change? A really simple guide,"Human activities are causing world temperatures to rise, with more intense heatwaves and rising sea-levels among the consequences.",2024-01-09,"Human activities are causing world temperatures to rise, with more intense heatwaves and rising sea-levels among the consequences. Things are likely to worsen in the coming decades, but scientists argue urgent action can limit the worst effects of climate change. Climate change is the long-term shift in the Earth's average temperatures and weather conditions. Over the last decade, the world was on average around 1.2C warmer than during the late 19th Century. It has now been confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather event. The last nine years were all among the nine warmest years on record. The climate has changed throughout the Earth's history and natural factors, such as El Niño, can affect the weather for shorter periods of time, like in 2023. But natural causes cannot explain the particularly rapid warming seen in the last century, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. This long-term climate change has been caused by human activity, the IPCC says, mainly from the widespread use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - in homes, factories and transport. When fossil fuels burn, they release greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). This traps extra energy in the atmosphere near the Earth's surface, causing the planet to heat up. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution - when humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by about 50%. The CO2 released from burning fossil fuels has a distinctive chemical fingerprint which matches the type increasingly found in the atmosphere. A global average temperature increase of 1.2C might not sound much. However, it has already had a huge effect on the environment, including: People's lives are also changing. For example, parts of East Africa suffered their worst drought in 40 years, putting more than 20 million people at risk of severe hunger. In 2022, intense European heatwaves led to an abnormal increase in deaths. The more temperatures increase, the worse the impacts of climate change become. Limiting long-term temperature rises to 1.5C is crucial, according to the IPCC. The science is not completely certain, but the consequences of 2C global warming versus 1.5C could include: The call to limit temperature rise to 1.5C was partly designed to avoid crossing so-called ""tipping points"". After these thresholds are crossed, changes could accelerate and become irreversible, such as the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, it's not clear precisely where these thresholds sit. About 3.3 to 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to the IPCC. People living in poorer countries are expected to suffer most as they have fewer resources to adapt. This has led to questions about fairness, because these places have typically only been responsible for a small percentage of greenhouse gas emissions. However, knock-on impacts could be felt over wide areas. For example, crop failures linked to extreme weather could raise global food prices. In a landmark agreement signed in Paris in 2015, almost 200 countries pledged to try to keep global warming to 1.5C. To achieve this, ""net zero"" CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050. Net zero means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and removing any remaining emissions from the atmosphere. Most countries have, or are considering, net zero targets. However, greenhouse gas levels are still rising quickly and the world is ""likely"" to warm beyond 1.5C, the IPCC says. However, there has been progress in some areas like the growth of renewable energy and electric vehicles. World leaders meet every year to discuss their climate commitments. The most recent UN climate change summit, COP28, was held in the United Arab Emirates. For the first time, countries agreed to ""contribute"" to ""transitioning away from fossil fuels"", although they are not forced to take action.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-62134399,How does the new Wales-wide 20mph speed limit law work?,Motorists in Wales now have to limit their speed to 20mph in built-up areas such as village and town centres.,2024-01-09,"Motorists in Wales now have to limit their speed to 20mph in built-up areas such as village and town centres. In 2022, the Senedd voted to make Wales the first nation in the UK to adopt 20mph as the default speed limit on restricted roads. It started on 17 September, and has proved controversial - but how does it work? Here we try our best to answer your queries. The 20mph limit has come into force for all restricted roads, which are defined as roads with lampposts placed not more than 200 yards (about 180m) apart. They are typically located in residential and built-up areas of high pedestrian activity. The 20mph limit began on 17 September 2023. The new law to make Wales the first nation to impose 20mph as the default on all restricted roads was passed by the Welsh Parliament in July 2022. The proposal was given the go-ahead by 39 votes to 15, after initial backing in the Senedd two years previously. The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 said it was not lawful to drive a on a restricted road at more than 30mph. That was later amended to 20mph. Enforcement began on 8 January, 2024, and roadside teams will use speed monitoring equipment to catch offending motorists. If you are pulled over doing more than 20mph in a built-up area in Wales you could, in theory, be fined a minimum £100 and get three penalty points. But police said their response will be proportionate and reasonable while drivers get used to the change as the focus for the first 12 months will be on education - as officers have a level of discretion. ""Where we find people driving above 20mph, we will stop drivers and speak to them about the dangers and risks about driving above the speed limit,"" said South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis. ""We won't be taking enforcement action against those people who are actually engaging with us and trying to bring their speed down - so they won't receive a fine. ""The people who will be fined will be those driving at the highest levels. Ultimately, if necessary, we will enforce - but that is always a last resort for us."" While police officers across Wales will initially be advised to use ""discretion"", all drivers will be fined if they are caught by a fixed speed camera. Receiving 12 or more points within three years may disqualify you from driving. If you are caught by a camera, depending on the speed, you will be sent an option for a speed awareness course, a fixed penalty notice or a letter telling you to go to court. If you are stopped by the police they can give you a verbal warning, send you a fixed penalty notice, offer a speed awareness course or order you to go to court. Instead of fines, speeding drivers will be offered the chance to watch a video about the dangers of speeding and the benefits of slowing down. Welsh government minister Lee Waters said there will be an ""education led"" approach to enforcement, as ""there's no incentive for us to fine because the money won't stay in Wales"". ""Police guidelines say enforcement will be targeted on drivers travelling 10% above the speed limit - plus 2mph,"" he said. ""For now this will be increased to 10% plus 4mph meaning we start to prosecute at 26mph in a 20mph limit."" As Mr Waters alluded to, the money collected from speeding fines in Wales goes to the UK government. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The money generated by 20mph speeding fines, as with all speeding fines, is directed to HM Treasury."" Speed limits in the Road Traffic Regulations and the Highway Code apply to motor vehicles only, and not to bicycles. But the Highway Code does state that cyclists should be considerate of other road users. The Welsh government has acknowledged the new lower limit is not appropriate everywhere and has said local authorities can make exceptions, though not outside schools. For example, Flintshire council identified 15 roads that could be exempt from the new policy. The Welsh government has produced an interactive map showing the status of current and proposed exemptions to the 20mph speed limit. There has been a pilot scheme running in eight areas of Wales since 2021. They are St Dogmaels in Pembrokeshire, St Brides Major in the Vale of Glamorgan, Llanelli (north), Buckley in Flintshire, Cardiff (north), Cilfrew in Neath Porth Talbot, Abergavenny and Severnside (Caerwent, Caldicot, Magor and Undy) in Monmouthshire. Interim data shows the number of drivers complying with the 20mph speed limit rose from 45% at the start of the trial to 64%. Many areas of London now have 20mph as the default speed for residential roads, while Scotland plans to follow Wales' lead and make the policy nationwide by 2025. Many cities and towns across the UK now have 20mph zones as the norm for residential areas even if the local authority does not have a blanket policy across the whole area. The cost of bringing it in has been estimated at £33m. The Welsh Government said the £32.5m price tag was ""outweighed"" by reduced impact on the NHS and emergency services, which one study said could save £92m a year. The Welsh government said the direct financial cost of the policy falls ""almost entirely"" on its shoulders, and it is funding the capital works carried out by the local authorities through grants. Latest police data from 2022 showed just over half - 51% - of the 4,442 people hurt in collisions in Wales happened on 30mph roads and in 23% of them, someone was killed or seriously injured. The total number of injuries fell by 23.5% compared to 2019. Campaigners argue the chances of someone surviving being hit by a car at 20mph rather than 30mph is seven times higher while stopping distances are almost halved. Ministers in the Senedd have been promoting sustainable travel - such as cycling or walking - after Wales declared a climate emergency in 2019 and aims to become carbon net zero by 2050. They think a lower limit might encourage a change in behaviour.","['Environment', 'Transport', 'Wales', 'Climate', 'Welsh government', 'Motoring', 'Road safety']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F697/production/_125872136_driving1gettyimages-660356594.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D752/production/_102022155_mediaitem102022154.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/101E3/production/_131091066_police_get.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/DD10/production/_125829565_bbc.graphic.png']","['Nicola Bryan', 'Natalie Grice']",Climate,Climate Change

Environment Minister Iziaq Salako told an event in Abuja that he wanted to send a clear message that the illegal wildlife trade would not be tolerated. Experts say tens of thousands of elephants are killed worldwide each year for their tusks. That is despite a decades-long ban on the international trade of ivory. The haul of elephant tusks destroyed on Tuesday was one of the biggest ever seized in Nigeria, weighing almost 2.5 tonnes. Some had been carved into artworks ready for sale. The destroyed ivory will now be pulverised into a powder, the environment minister said, which will be used to build a monument symbolising the importance of elephants and Nigeria's determination to protect them. According to conservationists, Nigeria has become a major hub for the illegal trade in animal parts from Africa. The biggest markets are said to be in Asia. In October, nearly four tonnes of seized pangolin scales were publicly destroyed. A recent report estimates that there are fewer than 500,000 elephants in Africa compared to more than 1.3 million in the 1970s. As few as 400 remain in Nigeria. In some cases, elephants are killed when they come into contact with humans or destroy crops. In December, Nigerian officials began investigating following outcry at a viral video that showed soldier shooting two elephants that had wandered on to farmland.","['Nigeria', 'Elephants', 'Conservation']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8364/production/_132263633_gettyimages-1913157709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16DC4/production/_132263639_gettyimages-1913138458.jpg']",['Chris Ewokor'],World,Africa

The two sides signed a deal on 1 January to give Ethiopia commercial and military access to the sea. Somalia called it an act of aggression. It considers Somaliland as part of its territory and has vowed to defend its sovereignty. Somaliland, a former British protectorate, seceded from Somalia in 1991 but is not internationally recognised as an independent state. Ethiopia's Field Marshal Birhanu Jula spoke with Somaliland's Maj Gen Nuh Ismael Tani about ""possible ways to work together"" at a meeting on Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's military said in a statement. No further details were given. Somaliland agreed to lease part of the coast to Ethiopia for a naval base in the 1 January Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that they signed, according to statements from both sides. Somaliland has said that in exchange Ethiopia would agree to recognise it as independent at some point in the future. Ethiopia has not confirmed this and instead talked about making ""an in-depth assessment towards taking a position regarding the efforts of Somaliland to gain recognition"". Somalia sees the MoU as an assault on its territorial integrity. On Sunday, its President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud asked people to prepare for the defence of the country. The African Union and the US have both moved to try and calm tensions. Somalia's allies, including Egypt and Turkey, have pledged their support for Somalia. As the military men from Ethiopia and Somaliland were meeting in Addis Ababa, Mr Mohamud was in Eritrea holding talks with his counterpart in Asmara, Isaias Afwerki. Official statements made no direct mention of Ethiopia's deal with Somaliland, but it is likely that the issue came up. Eritrea said the two leaders agreed to work together ""with patience and constructive spirit while refraining from a re-active posture to various provocative agendas"". On Monday, President Mohamud's office said the two leaders would ""discuss issues of mutual benefit"".","['Ethiopia', 'Eritrea', 'Somaliland', 'Somalia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AC8F/production/_132257144_ethiopiaarmy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png']",['Hanna Temuari'],World,Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67891394,TB Joshua exposé: How the pastor covered up fatal Lagos building collapse,"The BBC has unearthed new evidence the late Nigerian megachurch leader TB Joshua hid dead bodies and intimidated families, to cover up his role in the collapse of a building which killed at least 116 people at his church in 2014.",2024-01-09,"The BBC has unearthed new evidence the late Nigerian megachurch leader TB Joshua hid dead bodies and intimidated families, to cover up his role in the collapse of a building which killed at least 116 people at his church in 2014. The collapse is one of the worst disasters to ever strike a place of worship in Africa. The BBC's investigation is the first time insiders from TB Joshua's Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan) in Lagos have presented evidence of what caused the incident nearly 10 years ago, and of how the pastor allegedly orchestrated a cover-up. It follows evidence uncovered by the BBC of widespread abuse and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical churches. Two days after the collapse on 12 September 2014, TB Joshua publicly said it was linked to an aircraft that flew over the building used to house visiting pilgrims. But an inquiry by a Lagos coroner agreed with emergency workers that structural failure had caused the guest house to collapse, and said it had been built without proper planning permission. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that TB Joshua had been warned of serious structural problems prior to the disaster. They say the aeroplane explanation was a ""lie"". ""He knew the building was unstable,"" says Emmanuel, who spent more than a decade as a disciple of TB Joshua - a group of devout followers who lived in his church in Lagos. Like most of the former disciples interviewed by the BBC, he opted to only use his first name. He described the pastor receiving a report, hours before the collapse, that the building was ""swaying"" and ""shaking"". Multiple witnesses say the visitors were not warned. Instead more than 200 of them were led into the building's dining room on the ground floor to eat their lunch - where they were seated when all six storeys of concrete descended on top of them. Many were killed instantly, but more than 100 were trapped inside alive. ""I could hear people crying out: 'Help me, help me, help me,'"" says Emmanuel, who was on the scene within minutes of the collapse. ""Their voices were fading and you could tell these people were dying off."" Others described horrifically injured victims, with missing eyes and limbs - splintered by the beams which came down on top of them. ""It was quite clear that that building was never built for the height that TB Joshua built it to,"" says Rae, from the UK, who spent 12 years living in the church as a disciple. She says she was present when TB Joshua ordered his workers to construct additional floors: ""The foundations weren't built to hold a building of that many storeys. ""He just kept kind of pushing and saying: 'I want it higher. It must go higher. It must go higher.'"" The church insiders who spoke to the BBC also say lives could potentially have been saved had TB Joshua responded promptly to the collapse itself. Instead, they say, he blocked emergency services from accessing the site for 24 hours - an allegation corroborated by news reports at the time. During this crucial window for rescuing people and assisting the injured, the BBC's eyewitnesses say some church workers attempted to save lives in reckless and amateur ways. Without the use of mechanical equipment or medical training, they used tools from the church's maintenance department. In one instance, a church worker allegedly used a chainsaw to amputate the leg of a man who was trapped under a fallen beam. ""He was screaming!"" says Emmanuel, visibly shaken during his interview. He is not sure if the man survived. ""I saw a lot of things that really traumatised me… faces were crushed,"" says Michael, a disciple who was in his late teens at the time. Eyewitness testimonies of the horrific aftermath have never been published before, with many church insiders sworn to secrecy, and the site of the collapse shielded from public view by a large wall. Three sources, including Michael, say TB Joshua ordered his workers to move piles of dead bodies away from the building collapse site during the night, to hide them from the media and the authorities. Two say they were asked to film this activity, and to deliver the tapes to TB Joshua in his office. ""We were recording them as they put them into body bags… loads and loads of people,"" says Michael. Chloe, a former disciple of TB Joshua from the UK, also witnessed the aftermath of the collapse. She says she got into a bus and immediately noticed an awful smell. The driver told her the vehicle was ""full of dead bodies… and we're transporting them at night so that the press can't see them"". Multiple sources believe that the death toll was higher than the 116 figure given by the church, and cited friends and church workers who were inside at the time of the collapse who they say were not recorded in the official list of the dead. Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel World of Secrets - The Disciples A nine-episode season - a shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse Listen now on BBC Sounds The Nigerian authorities initially took a strong stance on the disaster. The Lagos coroner recommended that TB Joshua be charged with criminal negligence. Despite multiple summons, the pastor never attended court. A number of his former disciples say he handed out vast amounts of cash to people with influence over proceedings during this period. This included thousands of US dollars, South African rand and Nigerian naira to the families of the building collapse victims, 85 of whom were from South Africa. Sihle, a former disciple of TB Joshua, told the BBC she was given this job in South Africa ""to go and give money, bags of money"" to those who had lost relatives. ""We would tell them they mustn't speak to the media, they mustn't give reports or anything. Basically, we were silencing them,"" she says. Three families in South Africa confirmed to the BBC that church representatives tried to give them money and discouraged them from speaking to the press. Llwandle Mkhulisi, from Johannesburg, who lost his sister Pumzile in the disaster, described this cash as ""blood money"" and turned it down. After accepting an initial gift from the church of 50,000 rand (about $2,500: £2,000), Sonny Madzhiye from Benoni near Johannesburg says she turned down subsequent bundles of money for the death of her teenage daughter Sibongile. She says she began to realise she was being offered the cash not to take further action. TB Joshua harassed her with phone calls after she turned it down and threatened her: ""He sent me these messages. It says: 'If you focus on what you have lost, you might lose everything.' ""Now he's threatening me that my whole family will go down, the way my daughter went down."" She showed these messages and a recording of a call from TB Joshua to the BBC. Ms Madzhiye has subsequently attempted to sue Scoan in civil court in Nigeria, seeking damages for her daughter's death. The case is ongoing. Sihle says journalists were also provided with financial incentives in the aftermath of the disaster, to influence their reporting. ""We'd have journalists coming to the church for one thing or another, but journalists would leave with envelopes… he would give in dollars,"" she says. Chloe, who worked in TB Joshua's press department, confirmed that multiple journalists were given money during this period. This was confirmed by two journalists who spoke to the BBC and openDemocracy - a partner on this investigation. In a secret recording made by Nigerian journalist Nicholas Ibekwe in September 2014, TB Joshua can be clearly heard saying: ""Now what will you write about?"" after providing a table full of reporters with envelopes of money. Ibekwe turned down the cash offer. Emmanuel and Michael, who each spent more than 20 years inside the church, say they were ordered by TB Joshua to place envelopes of money in the cars of Nigerian politicians and court officials during the Lagos coroner's inquiry. ""He covered up everything,"" says Emmanuel. ""He bought the whole system."" TB Joshua died in June 2021, aged 57, but the church is now run by his widow Evelyn. The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in our investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" it wrote. To this day, many members of Scoan believe that a mysterious aeroplane was the cause of the building's collapse. Videos making this claim, produced by the church, have been broadcast on their world-wide Emmanuel TV satellite channel and are widely circulated on YouTube. Chloe, who spent 14 years as a disciple of TB Joshua, believes ""the families [of the victims] suffered a huge injustice"". Nearly a decade afterwards, no-one has ever been prosecuted for the collapse. The former guest house, a short distance from the main auditorium, remains a ruin. ""I didn't know I was sending my daughter to the church to be killed,"" says Ms Madzhiye, crying throughout her interview with the BBC. She still keeps her daughter's room as she left it, including a large teddy bear on the bed. ""My daughter was buried alive and helpless. The pain is too much. I'm still waiting for justice.""

Salem Bazoum left for Togo after mediation efforts by regional leaders led to him being freed. He was detained along with his parents at the presidential palace after the military staged a coup last July. His parents remain in detention, with the junta so far refusing to bow to diplomatic pressure to release them. In a statement, the military tribunal said that the release of Mr Bazoum Jnr was provisional, and it would be ""up to him to respond to justice as soon as he is required to do so"". He had been charged with conspiracy to undermine the authority of the state following the coup. In October, the junta alleged that the ousted president and his family, his two cooks and two security officials made a failed attempt to escape. Togo's Foreign Minister Robert Dussey came to Niger to escort Mr Bazoum Jnr out of the country, the tribunal's statement said. Togo's government confirmed his release, but did not give details of his whereabouts. Sierra Leone had also been involved in mediation efforts to secure the release of the ousted president's son, it added in a statement. Last month, the court of the West African regional bloc Ecowas ruled that the Bazoum family's detention was arbitrary. It ordered their release, and the reinstatement of Mr Bazoum as president. The military junta has ignored the ruling, and has said that there would be a transition of up to three years to civilian rule. Mr Bazoum was overthrown by the head of the presidential bodyguard, Gen Abdourahamane Tiani, in a coup that was denounced by Ecowas and Western nations, including former colonial power France. The last French troops withdrew from Niger last month on the orders of the junta. Ecowas said it would maintain sanctions on Niger until it saw progress on a return to civilian rule. The sanctions have contributed to a sharp rise in food prices and a shortage of some basic items in Niger.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67911057,Ethiopia-Somaliland deal makes waves in Horn of Africa,The defence minister of the self-declared republic of Somaliland has become the latest casualty of the row over a controversial agreement that is causing ructions in the Horn of Africa.,2024-01-09,"The defence minister of the self-declared republic of Somaliland has become the latest casualty of the row over a controversial agreement that is causing ructions in the Horn of Africa. Abdiqani Mohamoud Ateye resigned saying that cabinet ministers should have been consulted over a deal that Somaliland struck with Ethiopia that could see it leasing part of its coastline to its landlocked neighbour. Somalia - which considers Somaliland to be part of its territory - reacted angrily to the 1 January deal, calling it an act of aggression. Both the US and the African Union have backed the territorial integrity of Somalia and urged all parties to cool tensions. The exact wording of the deal signed by the leaders of Ethiopia and Somaliland has not been made public, which is a problem as there are differing versions of what the two sides agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). An MoU is a statement of intent rather than a legally binding agreement but what seems clear is that Somaliland is ready to grant Ethiopia access to the sea for commercial traffic through a port, although it is not clear which port that would be. There is also a military aspect. Somaliland has said it could lease a section of the coast to Ethiopia's navy, a detail which has been confirmed by Addis Ababa. In return, Somaliland will get a share in Ethiopia Airlines, the country's successful national carrier. But where things get sticky is whether Ethiopia said it would recognise Somaliland as an independent state - something which no other country has done in the 30 years since the former British protectorate said it was leaving Somalia. On the day of the signing, Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi said the agreement included a section stating that Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland as an independent country at some point in the future. Ethiopia has not confirmed this. Instead, in its attempt to clarify what was in the MoU, the government on 3 January said the deal included ""provisions… to make an in-depth assessment towards taking a position regarding the efforts of Somaliland to gain recognition"". For Somalia, Somaliland is an integral part of its territory. Any suggestion that it could make a deal with another country or that bits of it could be leased without the approval of Mogadishu is highly problematic. The day after the MoU was signed, Somalia described the deal as an act of ""aggression"" that was an ""impediment to… peace and stability"". It also recalled its ambassador from Addis Ababa. On Sunday, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud stepped up the rhetoric saying: ""We will defend our country, we will defend it by all means necessary and seek the support of any ally willing to help us."" He also called on youths ""to prepare for the defence of our country"". Last week there were protests in Mogadishu against the deal with tens of thousands turning up to express their opposition. Somaliland, a former British protectorate, declared itself independent from Somalia in 1991 and has all the trappings of a country, including a working political system, regular elections, a police force and its own currency. Over the decades it has also escaped much of the chaos and violence that have hit Somalia. But its independence has not been recognised by any country. If, as Somaliland said, Ethiopia has agreed to recognise it at some point, it would have a profound impact on the Horn of Africa region. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last year described access to the sea as an existential issue. Ethiopia lost its ports when Eritrea seceded in the early 1990s. With more than 100 million people, it is the most populous landlocked country in the world. Mr Abiy's statement raised fears that Ethiopia could try to achieve its goal by force. It has described the deal with Somaliland as historic, and emphasised that its intentions are peaceful. ""The position announced by the government is strongly rooted in a desire to not engage in war with anyone,"" Ethiopia's communications office said. But in an oblique reference to the controversy, Mr Abiy said on X on Sunday that ""if we expect things to happen in ways that we are used to or know or can predict, [opportunities] may pass us"". He added that some sometimes ""out of the box"" thinking was needed to achieve goals. On 3 January, African Union commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat called for calm and mutual respect ""to de-escalate the simmering tension"" between Ethiopia and Somalia.

He was prevented from leaving his home in southern Katanga province on Monday, his spokesperson Hervé Diakesse said. But the security forces later withdrew on the orders of a local governor. Mr Katumbi has rejected President Félix Tshisekedi's landslide victory in last month's election as a sham. Five other opposition leaders, including Martin Fayulu, who came third, have called for a protest march against the election results. On Monday evening, residents of Kashobwe village were seen in social media videos trooping to Mr Katumbi's home after news spread that security forces were preventing him from leaving. One of Mr Katumbi's relatives told French RFI news website that the home was surrounded by ""heavily armed soldiers"". ""We are struggling to figure out why,"" Mr Diakesse, told Reuters news agency. In a bid to defuse the escalating crisis, provincial governor Jacques Kyabula Katwe ordered the security forces to leave, calling the incident a ""faux pas"". He said the initial intention of the security forces was to protect Mr Katumbi's property from potential acts of vandalism. The 20 December election was marred by widespread logistical problems, with some independent observers raising concerns about the vote. Only one candidate has gone to court to challenge the presidential election results. The main ones say they have no faith in the courts and have instead called for the population to ""resist electoral fraud"" without giving any details. Mr Tshisekedi won about 73% of the vote, while Mr Katumbi got 18% and Mr Fayulu 5%, the election commission said. Western governments have called for restraint amid fears of post-election violence, with the UN's top human rights official, Volker Turk, voicing alarm about rising ethnic tension.

Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation Minister Betta Edu was suspended on Monday following public outrage over the scandal. A statement from President Bola Tinubu's office said he had ordered an investigation into Dr Edu's ministry. Dr Edu has denied any wrongdoing. Her office said she had approved the transfer into a personal account, which was not in her name, but said it was for the ""implementation of grants to vulnerable groups"". Dr Edu, 37, is the youngest minister in President Tinubu's cabinet and is seen as a close ally of the president. The suspension of a minister is a rare occurrence in Nigeria - Dr Edu is the first to lose their job since President Tinubu took office in May last year. His predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, sacked only two ministers during his eight-year tenure. Last week, local media reported on a leaked document that allegedly showed Dr Edu instructing a senior treasury official to transfer the money to the personal account of Bridget Oniyelu, the accountant for the government's Grants for Vulnerable Groups initiative. Reports that Dr Edu had asked for the funds be moved to a personal account, rather than a government one, caused outrage. Mr Tinubu called for an investigation into the transfer on Sunday. He asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for a ""thorough investigation into all aspects of the financial transactions involving the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation,"" said a statement released on Monday. Mr Tinubu asked Dr Edu to comply with the investigation. He also called for the reform of government institutions that run National Social Investments Programmes (NSIP) - initiatives like the Grant for Vulnerable Groups that aim to tackle poverty - stressing a need to ""win back lost public confidence"".

Puntland is a destination for many Somalis displaced by violence in the south.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67901064,Ousman Sonko: Gambian ex-minister goes on trial in Switzerland for murder,"A Gambian former interior minister has gone on trial in Switzerland, charged with crimes against humanity.",2024-01-09,"A Gambian former interior minister has gone on trial in Switzerland, charged with crimes against humanity. Ousman Sonko fled there in 2016, shortly before Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, accused of heading a repressive regime, lost power. Mr Sonko, 54, was arrested after non-governmental organisations presented evidence of his alleged involvement in killings, rape and torture. But his lawyer said that he was not responsible for what happened. Philippe Currat is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that The Gambia's National Intelligence Agency, which was ""never... under [his] authority"" was behind the alleged crimes. Switzerland is trying the case under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows countries to prosecute people on their territory, even though the events may have taken place elsewhere. Mr Sonko is the highest-ranking government official ever to be prosecuted under this principle in Europe. Human rights groups believe the trial, taking place in the southern Swiss city of Bellinzona, could be a warning to repressive governments everywhere that the arm of the law can be very long indeed. Switzerland's charge sheet against Mr Sonko is extensive. It includes the participation in, or ordering of, killings, torture and rape - all targeting political opponents. These could constitute crimes against humanity under Swiss law. Swiss investigators travelled to The Gambia and interviewed dozens of alleged victims and witnesses - nine will be in court to testify. From 1996 until 2016, The Gambia was ruled by President Yahya Jammeh, whose time in office, according to Human Rights Watch, was characterised by ""widespread abuses, including forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings"". Mr Sonko was Mr Jammeh's right-hand man, his role as interior minister putting him in charge of the security services, including, allegedly, a sinister paramilitary group known as ""the Junglers"". But in 2016, shortly before Mr Jammeh himself lost power, Mr Sonko fled to Switzerland, where he claimed asylum. Within months he was arrested, after an NGO, Trial International, gave the Swiss authorities details of abuses he was allegedly involved in. After six trips to The Gambia and 40 interviews with complainants, the Swiss attorney general drew up the charge sheet. This is only the second time that Switzerland has ever tried someone under universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity. The first case, in June 2023, saw former Liberian militia leader Alieu Kosiah sentenced to 20 years for crimes including rape, murder, and cannibalism. Other countries are also bringing cases against former members of Mr Jammeh's regime. In October, Germany handed a life sentence for crimes against humanity to Bai Lowe, a one-time member of ""the Junglers"". Later this year, a court in the US state of Colorado will begin the trial of an alleged former member of the same group. Although The Gambia has created its own transitional justice process to address abuses committed under Mr Jammeh's rule, human rights groups say its work has so far been very slow. Even in the Swiss trial against Mr Sonko, one of the plaintiffs who had been scheduled to testify died before the case came to court. But for those who do testify, ""being invited before a court of law, to tell their stories, is a way for them to heal. And if the federal court does reach a guilty verdict, it will be an enormous relief for them. They will get the answers they have been waiting for for many years,"" Trial International's Benoit Meystre said. The court case is expected to last a month with a verdict coming in March.","['The Gambia', 'Switzerland', 'Yahya Jammeh']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/153BC/production/_132227968_8e1fd363c4f1a059b829c42729afff567f8b6b9620_603_6828_38431000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1ED6/production/_107249870_afp.jpg']",['Imogen Foulkes'],World,Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67749215,"TB Joshua: Megachurch leader raped and tortured worshippers, BBC finds",Evidence of widespread abuse and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical churches has been uncovered by the BBC.,2024-01-09,"Evidence of widespread abuse and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical churches has been uncovered by the BBC. Dozens of ex-Synagogue Church of all Nations members - five British - allege atrocities, including rape and forced abortions, by Nigeria's late TB Joshua. The allegations of abuse in a secretive Lagos compound span almost 20 years. The Synagogue Church of All Nations did not respond to the allegations but said previous claims have been unfounded. TB Joshua, who died in 2021, was a charismatic and hugely successful preacher and televangelist who had an immense global following. The BBC's findings over a two-year investigation include: One of the victims, a British woman, called Rae, was 21 years old when she abandoned her degree at Brighton University in 2002 and was recruited into the church. She spent the next 12 years as one of Joshua's so-called ""disciples"" inside his maze-like concrete compound in Lagos. Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside UK) ""We all thought we were in heaven, but we were in hell, and in hell terrible things happen,"" she told the BBC. Rae says she was sexually assaulted by Joshua and subjected to a form of solitary confinement for two years. The abuse was so severe, she says she attempted suicide multiple times inside the compound. The Synagogue Church of All Nations [Scoan] has a global following, operating a Christian TV channel called Emmanuel TV and social media networks with millions of viewers. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, tens of thousands of pilgrims from Europe, the Americas, South East Asia and Africa travelled to the church in Nigeria to witness Joshua performing ""healing miracles"". At least 150 visitors lived with him as disciples inside his compound in Lagos, sometimes for decades. More than 25 former ""disciples"" spoke to the BBC - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - giving powerful corroborating testimony about their experiences within the church, with the most recent experiences in 2019. Many victims were in their teens when they first joined. In some of the British cases, their transport to Lagos was paid for by Joshua, in co-ordination with other UK churches. Rae and multiple other interviewees compared their experiences to being in a cult. Jessica Kaimu, from Namibia, says her ordeal lasted more than five years. She says she was 17 when Joshua first raped her, and that subsequent instances of rape by TB Joshua led to her having five forced abortions while there. ""These were backdoor type… medical treatments that we were going through… it could have killed us,"" she told the BBC. Other interviewees say they were stripped and beaten with electrical cables and horse whips, and routinely denied sleep. On his death in June 2021, TB Joshua was hailed as one of the most influential pastors in African history. Rising from poverty, he built an evangelical empire that counted dozens of political leaders, celebrities and international footballers among his associates. He did, however, attract some controversy during his lifetime when a guesthouse for church pilgrims collapsed in 2014, killing at least 116 people. The BBC's investigation, which was carried out with international media platform openDemocracy, is the first time multiple former church insiders have come forward to speak on the record. They say they've spent years trying to raise the alarm, but have effectively been silenced. A number of our witnesses in Nigeria claim they were physically attacked, and in one case shot at, after previously speaking out against the abuse and posting videos containing allegations on YouTube. A BBC crew that attempted to record footage of the church's Lagos compound from a public street in March 2022 was also fired at by the church's security, and was detained for a number of hours. The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in our investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" it wrote. Four of the British citizens who spoke to the BBC say they reported the abuse to the UK authorities after escaping the church. They say no further action was taken. In addition, a British man and his wife emailed eyewitness accounts of their ordeal and video evidence - including recordings of being held at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police who are also members of Scoan - to the British High Commission in Nigeria in March 2010 after fleeing the church. In his email, the man said his wife had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped by Joshua. He warned the commission that other British nationals were still inside the compound facing atrocities. He also says no action was taken. The UK Foreign Office did not respond to these claims, but told the BBC that it takes all reports of crime, including sexual assault and violence against British nationals overseas, very seriously. Scoan continues to thrive today, under the leadership of Joshua's widow, Evelyn. In July 2023, she led a tour of Spain. Anneka, who left Derby in the UK to join Scoan at the age of 17, told the BBC she believes there are many other victims who have yet to speak out. She hopes further steps will be taken to uncover Joshua's actions. ""I believe the Synagogue Church of All Nations needs a thorough investigation into why this man was able to function for so long the way he did,"" she said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67920167,South Korea passes law banning dog meat trade,The slaughter and sale of dogs for their meat is to become illegal in South Korea after MPs backed a new law.,2024-01-09,"The slaughter and sale of dogs for their meat is to become illegal in South Korea after MPs backed a new law. The legislation, set to come into force by 2027, aims to end the centuries-old practice of humans eating dog meat. Dog meat stew, called ""boshintang"", is considered a delicacy among some older South Koreans, but the meat has fallen out of favour with diners and is no longer popular with young people. Under the new law the consumption of dog meat itself will not be illegal. According to a Gallup poll last year, only 8% of people said they had tried dog meat in the past 12 months, down from 27% in 2015. Fewer than a fifth of those polled said they supported the consumption of the meat. Lee Chae-yeon, a 22-year-old student, said the ban was necessary to promote animal rights. ""More people have pets today,"" she told the BBC in Seoul. ""Dogs are like family now and it's not nice to eat our family."" The new law focuses on the dog meat trade - those convicted of butchering dogs face up to three years in prison, while people found guilty of raising dogs for meat or selling dog meat could serve a maximum of two years. Farmers and restaurant owners have three years to find alternative sources of employment and income before the legislation comes into force. According to government statistics, South Korea had around 1,600 dog meat restaurants and 1,150 dog farms in 2023, all of which will now have to submit a plan to phase out their businesses to their local authorities. The government has promised to fully support dog meat farmers, butchers and restaurant owners, whose businesses will be forced to close, though the details of what compensation will be offered have yet to be worked through. On Tuesday lunchtime in Seoul, down an alleyway with several dog meat restaurants, a handful of older people were tucking into the stew and the generational divide was stark. Kim Seon-ho, 86, was disappointed by the ban. ""We've eaten this since the Middle Ages. Why stop us from eating our traditional food?"" he said. ""If you ban dog meat then you should ban beef."" Previous governments, dating back to the 1980s, have pledged to ban dog meat, but failed to make progress. Current President Yoon Suk Yeol and First Lady Kim Keon Hee are known animal lovers - they have six dogs, and Ms Kim has called for the practice of eating dogs to end. Animal rights groups, which have long been pushing for the ban, praised the outcome of Tuesday's vote. Jung Ah Chae, the executive director of the Humane Society in Korea, said she was surprised to see the ban in her lifetime. ""While my heart breaks for all the millions of dogs for whom this change has come too late, I am overjoyed that South Korea can now close this miserable chapter in our history and embrace a dog friendly future,"" she said. Dog meat farmers had campaigned against the ban. They argued that, given the declining popularity among young people, the practice should be allowed to die out naturally over time. Many farmers and restaurateurs are elderly and said it would be difficult for them to switch livelihoods so late in life. One dog farmer, Joo Yeong-bong, told the BBC the industry was in despair. ""In 10 years, the industry would have disappeared. We're in our 60s and 70s and now we have no choice but to lose our livelihoods,"" he said, adding that this was ""an infringement of people's freedom to eat what they like"". One dog meat restaurant owner in her 60s, Mrs Kim, told the BBC she was frustrated by the ban, and blamed it on the rise in the number of people in South Korea having pets. ""Young people these days don't get married, so they think of pets as family, but food is food. We should accept dog meat but raise and slaughter them in a hygienic environment,"" she said. ""Other countries like China and Vietnam eat dogs, so why are we banning it?""","['Meat', 'South Korea', 'Asia', 'Dogs']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/03BB/production/_132255900_gettyimages-1252130182.jpg'],"['Jean Mackenzie', 'Jake Kwon', 'Hosu Lee']",World,Asia

The leader of the secretive state has never actually revealed his birthday, leaving North Korea watchers to puzzle out when it actually takes place. If they are right, he hit the milestone age on Monday, the same day official pictures were released of him and his daughter visiting a chicken farm. The low-key day stands in stark contrast to those of his predecessors. In fact, the birthdays of his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung - large, national celebrations during their time in power - are still marked by holidays to this day. Exactly why the date, suggested to be 8 January, remains a secret is not known. It has been hinted at previously, with North Korean officials thanking then US President Donald Trump for his birthday wishes back in January 2020 - although they did not specify which day. Further evidence of the date had emerged six years earlier, when US basketball player Dennis Rodman sang happy birthday to Kim Jong Un in front of a crowd of thousands. Gilsup Kwak, head of One Korea Center, a website specialising in North Korean affairs, suggests a number of reasons for the silence - not least, his mother Ko Yong Hui, and the fact she was reportedly born in Japan. There is still widespread distrust of Japan - which colonised the region between 1910 and 1945 - in North Korean society, and the link could undermine Kim Jong Un's bloodline claims, meaning it has so far been swept under the carpet. Making a big deal of his birthday, therefore, may bring unwanted attention. ""Kim Jong Un's Achilles' heel is the truth of his birth,"" Mr Kwak explained. However, there could be numerous other explanations, he says, including believing ""that idolising his ancestors and family is enough"" and wanting to ""promote his image as a humble leader"". Others suggest his age is the problem. Experts say that older members of North Korea's ruling elite feel he is still too young - although it is notable that his father's birthday became an official holiday the year he turned 40.","['Kim Jong Un', 'North Korea']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/32AF/production/_132257921_kimbirthday.jpg'],"['Fan Wang', 'Flora Drury']",World,Asia

It's a far rarer sight now as more and more of those likenesses, which once exceeded 40,000, are removed. Some 200-odd statues have been stashed away in a riverside park south of the capital Taipei. Here, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is standing, sitting, in marshal's uniform, in scholars' robes, astride a stallion, surrounded by adoring children, and in his dotage leaning on a walking stick. A democratic Taiwan no longer seems to have room for its erstwhile ruler, who moved the Republic of China here after fleeing impending defeat at the hands of Mao Zedong's communist forces. The mainland became the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan has remained the Republic of China. Both claimed the other's territory. Neither Chiang, nor Mao, conceived of Taiwan as a separate place with a separate people. But that is what it has become. Unlike Taiwan, China's claims never waned. But almost everything else has changed on either side of the 100-mile strait. China has become richer, stronger and an unmistakable threat. Taiwan has become a democracy and is in the middle of yet another election where its ties with Beijing are being tested. No matter the result of Saturday's vote, its freedom is a danger to the Chinese Communist Party's hopes of unification. There are still those who see themselves, like Chiang, as Chinese - they look to China with admiration and even longing. On the other side are those who feel deeply Taiwanese. They see Beijing as yet another colonising foreign power, like Chiang and the Japanese before him. There are also 600,000 or so indigenous peoples who trace their ancestry back thousands of years. And then there is a younger, ambivalent generation that is wary of questions about identity. They feel Taiwanese but see no need for Taiwan to declare independence. They want peace with China, they want to do business with it but they have no desire to ever be part of it. ""I am Taiwanese. But I believe in the Republic of China,"" says a woman in her 50s, wrapped in tinsel and Christmas lights, much like Elton John. This is an uncommon response at an election rally for the Koumintang or KMT, the party Chiang led until his death in 1975. And this is their heartland -  Taoyuan County - where tens of thousands have turned out to see their presidential candidate, Ho You-ih. The KMT is proposing peace and dialogue with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its old nemesis. Taiwan, it says, can prosper only when it talks to Beijing. ""We should be friends with the mainland,"" the woman says, laughing. ""We can make money together!"" Her name is impossible to hear over the deafening sound of patriotic rock. There is a huge roar of approval as Chiang Wan-an, the great-grandson of Chiang Kai-shek and a rising star in the KMT, comes on to the stage. ""I like him very much, he's very handsome,"" says the woman in the tinsel. ""I hope he will be president one day!"" The crowd is overwhelmingly those in their 50s or 60s, traditional KMT supporters with family or business ties to the mainland. ""I am Chinese. Taiwan is just a small island. Look at China!"" says one man in his 50s, excited about China's recent spate of space launches. ""Of course we should reunify - not now maybe, but one day we must reunify."" There are few young people in the crowd - those who are don't seem to be drawn to the KMT's legacy. ""I'm not voting for the party, I'm voting for the candidate,"" says Lin Chen-ze. ""I am Taiwanese, but I want peace. The [ruling] Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for eight years, it's time for a change, and Ho You-ih is a good man. He is honest and efficient."" The answers to a decades-old question - Do you see yourself as Chinese or Taiwanese? - are getting mixed up. For Beijing that is alarming. For Taiwan's political parties, it is a delicate, new dance, where ideological certainties are being quietly shelved. ""It's not right what they've done to these statues,"" says Fan Hsun-chung, a sprightly, 94-year-old veteran, as he walks through the park full of Chiang's statues. Fan was 18 in 1947 when he left his home in Sichuan, deep in the mountains of southwest China, to join Chiang's army. In early 1949, as the Chinese civil war turned dramatically against them, Fan's unit was shipped to Taiwan to prepare for its use as a bastion. Six months later Chiang, his government and a defeated army of close to a million men followed. Fan thought he would return home soon. But after Mao took power, he couldn't go home, or even write home. ""So, I waited and waited, for decades."" He didn't see his hometown - far up a tributary of the mighty Yangtze river - until 1990. By then his family was long dead, many of them persecuted by the Communist Party for his actions as a ""counter-revolutionary"". His mother and older brother, he learned, had starved to death during Mao's industrialisation drive, which had triggered a famine. Despite his seven decades in Taiwan, Fan says he never stopped feeling Chinese: ""When we came here our country did not perish: we are still the Republic of China. Taiwan is a province, one of the smallest of more than 30 provinces."" Not far from here is where Chiang himself lies in unquiet rest: inside a black marble sarcophagus, still unburied nearly half a century after his death. ""We were fighting for the unification of China,"" Fan says. ""We wanted China to be strong, unified and independent. That was our dream."" For Chiang, Taiwan was only a stronghold from which to lick his wounds and pursue dreams of reconquering China. The man and his dream may be long dead, but his imprint is obvious. Walk the streets of Taipei and you are surrounded by names from a bygone era in China: Nanjing East Road, Bei-ping North Road, Chang-an West Road. The language used for education and commerce is Mandarin, a dialect from northern China. Taipei is a city of wheat noodles and dumplings, again northern fare. There are also plenty of excellent Shanghainese restaurants: a legacy of the exodus of much of that city's business elite as the communists took power. But Chiang's legacy came at a huge cost. Any expressions of Taiwanese political identity were ruthlessly crushed. Many thousands were tortured, imprisoned and executed under Chiang, whose personality cult rivalled that of Mao, Stalin or Kim Il Sung. The period entered the history books as the White Terror. The KMT and the CCP are ""like identical twins with the same mindset"", says 86-year-old John Chen, a political activist.  ""They both have this idea that we are all part of Greater China."" Chen is walking through the cell block of an old military detention centre on the south side of Taipei - a place he knows all too well. In 1969, a military court tried and jailed him here. He had been married three weeks. He spent the next 10 years in Jing Mei, one of Taipei's most feared prisons. His crime: taking part in a pro-Taiwan independence group while in medical school in Japan. He shared the cramped cell with six other inmates. They had no bunks, only a squat toilet in the corner and a tap and a bucket to wash. They sweltered in the summer and froze in the winter. They were allowed out for exercise for just 15 minutes a day. Chen, who was born under Japanese rule, speaks fluent Japanese, and admits to feeling more affinity with the ways of Japan than with those of mainland China. ""I don't consider myself Chinese. I am Taiwanese,"" he says. Chen is among the many millions - the majority of the island - whose families emigrated from China. They largely came from Fujian in several waves starting in the early 1600s. They speak Taiwanese, a version of southern Fujian dialect, as different from Mandarin as English is from Portuguese. To him, ""Taiwan is already independent"" and the future is bright. ""One day the Chinese Communist Party will collapse. And when it does, we can fully join the international community."" He dismisses Beijing's claims that Taiwan is part of China because they share a common culture and language. ""Where does that leave Tibet or Xinjiang? And if the Chinese nation is built on being Chinese or speaking Chinese, what about Singapore?"" The era of military rule is long over, and monuments across Taiwan commemorate the White Terror. But Beijing's persistent claims, some argue, are making a bristling, younger generation rethink how they see themselves. Lōa Ēng-hôa began learning Taiwanese about five years ago. Now he only speaks in Taiwanese, or English, but refuses to speak in Mandarin. To him it is the language of a colonial oppressor. He likens it to British people being forced to speak Italian because England was once part of the Roman Empire. ""When I was at elementary school, we would gather each morning and sing the [Republic of China] national anthem. And there were always some lazy students who didn't bother singing, and I would shout at them 'don't you love your country!' I really thought I was Chinese."" He says it was only when he went to work in Australia and saw how it was dealing with its turbulent history, that he began to awaken to his identity. Under KMT rule, school children were forbidden from speaking Taiwanese and punished if they did. Taiwanese parents made their children speak Mandarin, even at home, believing that it would help them get into university or find a good job. Lōa says Taiwanese may not be banned but its "" ideological dominance"" persists. ""And the most important thing is that we are still denied the right to be educated in Taiwanese - 80% of people are ethnically Taiwanese, but we don't have the right to be educated in our own language. How ridiculous is that?"" For young people like him, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which once called for Taiwanese independence and whose success grew out of anti-Beijing sentiment, is not going far enough. The DPP was once a ragtag outfit that struggled to win local elections and parliamentary seats. Taiwanese was the language of its rallies. Now, it's the party of power. It has ruled for 16 years in total, including the last eight. Now its young supporters speak fluent English and are passionate about the environment and LGBTQ rights, more so than any urgent need for formal Taiwan independence. At a recent rally in Taipei, the DPP's vice-presidential candidate, Hsiao Bi-khim made her first big public address. Young and charismatic, she was a big hit with the crowd. In Beijing, she is loathed: born in Japan to an American mother and Taiwanese father, Hsiao's most recent job was as Taiwan's de-facto ambassador to the United States. China's state media has been busy spreading rumours that she can barely speak Mandarin, which is untrue. But China fears the rise of politicians like Hsiao, who have almost no family ties to the mainland, and see Taiwan as closer to Tokyo and Washington than Beijing. Beyond the DPP, this is the first election where all three presidential candidates are of Taiwanese descent. None are from families that came to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949. The KMT's Hou is the son of a market trader from southern Taiwan who climbed through the ranks of the police force to head the national investigation bureau. Today, the DPP no longer talks about the need for formal independence and the KMT speaks of dialogue with Beijing, but sidesteps the subject of unification, or whether Taiwan is part of China. Both are now embracing Taiwan's peculiar ""status quo""- it elects its own leaders, but it is not considered a country. At the KMT rally, the woman in tinsel summed it up bluntly: ""This is the mountain protecting us. Without the Republic of China [status], Taiwan is finished. Taiwan can't be independent. Independence means war."" This is what experts call ""strategic ambiguity"". So far it has satisfied everyone, including Beijing. But that is not how people define who they are. ""We are all Taiwanese today regardless of where our grandparents came from. We inter-marry and mix Taiwanese and Mandarin when we speak to each other,"" say a group of hikers on a trail near Taipei. When they travel abroad, they say they are from Taiwan. ""We do not want people to think we are from China."" That is a problem for Beijing - because they are deciding what they want to be. And that runs counter to the CCP's message - a unified China under the rule of the Communist Party. It's a message that has been delivered to Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols - and Hong Kong. Not everyone feels Taiwanese, or exclusively Taiwanese, but more and more young people seem to lean this way, polls suggest. Even in this new Taiwan, Chiang's family name counts. Many here say they would like to see the KMT nominate his great-grandson in 2028. And Hsiao has been touted as a contender for the DPP. Either could win, but the challenge for China is that the Taiwanese will decide. Young voters say all they care about is peace: ""I have two younger brothers and I am very worried they will end up fighting in a war with China,"" says 21-year-old Shen Lu at the KMT rally. Like their most powerful allies, few Taiwanese talk of independence because that feels impractical, even impossible. But peace has become a refrain for keeping what they have - whatever they might choose to call it. ""I am Taiwanese but the most important thing for my generation is peace,"" Shen says. ""I don't want unification. I want the situation to stay as it is now. We should keep it like this forever.""","['Communist Party of China', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BF1/production/_132256279_chiangkai-shekpark-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12665/production/_132256357_gettyimages-1910620866-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C8A5/production/_132256315_chiangkaishekgrandsononstagewithcandidate.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9DAD/production/_132256304_kmtrally-7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/154E1/production/_132256278_chiangkai-shekpark1-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/151A4/production/_132263468_fleamarket-gettyimages-1247445592.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A195/production/_132256314_speakingtousinacell.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2C65/production/_132256311_manwhowon'tspeakmansdarin116_9.jpg"", 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B2C/production/_132263472_dpprally_gettyimages-1908162463.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135A1/production/_132256297_tinsellady.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6315/production/_132256352_gettyimages-1906596689.jpg']",['Rupert Wingfield-Hayes'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67920011,"US Navy sailor jailed for passing military blueprints, plans to China",A US Navy sailor who admitted to providing sensitive military information to China has been jailed for more than two years.,2024-01-09,"A US Navy sailor who admitted to providing sensitive military information to China has been jailed for more than two years. Wenheng Zhao, 26, pleaded guilty in October to passing on information to Chinese intelligence for bribes. Mr Zhao was a petty officer working at a California naval base. He passed on information about military exercises, operational orders and critical infrastructure from 2021 to 2023, US officials said. Specifically, he provided information about the US Navy's large-scale drills in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as electrical diagrams and blueprints for a radar system located at the US base on the Japanese island of Okinawa. The US Navy's base there in Okinawa is critical to its operations in Asia. The US has made what it calls the ""Indo-Pacific"" region a key security priority, and in recent years has worked on shoring up alliances there to counter China's ramped-up military presence. In the past few years it has expanded the naval drills it operates with allies in the region. However, US authorities gave no indication that information about other countries' naval drills was compromised. Zhao, who had security clearance and worked at Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, had specifically entered restricted military and naval installations ""to collect and record"" information, the US Justice Department said. He also used ""sophisticated encrypted communication methods"" to pass on the information, destroyed evidence and concealed his relationship with a Chinese spy. He was paid at least 14 separate bribes between August 2021- May 2023, to a total of at least $14,866 (£11,650). Zhao is a naturalised US citizen who was born in China. He immigrated to the US in 2009, became a citizen in 2012 and enlisted in the navy five years later. He was arrested last August in California and pleaded guilty to the spying charges in October. On Monday a Californian district court sentenced him to 27 months in jail. He had faced a maximum 20 year sentence. There were no reports of any of his comments. Authorities have also not provided information as to the motivation for his betrayal, beyond financial reasons. In October, following Zhao's guilty plea, US Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said China's intelligence services ""actively target clearance holders across the military, seeking to entice them with money to provide sensitive government information."" On Monday he reiterated the warning. ""Mr Zhao betrayed his solemn oath to defend his country and endangered those who serve in the US military,"" he said. Mr Olsen added that US authorities were committed to combatting Chinese government efforts to ""undermine our nation's security"". Another US Navy member was also arrested last year, around the same time as Zhao, and charged with spying offences. Jinchao Wei, 22, a naturalised US citizen, is accused of conspiring to send national defence information to a Chinese agent. Wei had served on the amphibious assault ship the USS Essex and was accused of handing over dozens of documents, photos and videos detailing the operation of ships and their systems to China. It is unclear if the same Chinese agent is alleged to have contacted both men. China's embassy in Washington on Monday said it was not aware of the details of Zhao's case. It accused the US government and media of hyping up espionage cases, many of which it said were based on unfounded allegations.","['United States', 'US Armed Forces', 'China-US relations', 'Spying']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8511/production/_132256043_gettyimages-1482759216.jpg'],['Frances Mao'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67871587,Why the Taiwan election matters,All eyes will be on Taiwan when the self-governing island of 23 million people goes to the polls on 13 January.,2024-01-09,"All eyes will be on Taiwan when the self-governing island of 23 million people goes to the polls on 13 January. Whoever is elected president on Saturday will shape relations with both Beijing and Washington - Taiwan is a key flashpoint in their tussle for power in this region. And it will also have crucial implications for the island's neighbours as well as allies like Japan who are wary of Beijing's aggressive moves in the South China Sea. China is among the top concerns for most voters, given that its People's Liberation Army has dialled up pressure on the island over the past year with a record number of incursions. Beijing has long claimed the island, but ties have especially soured in recent years under President Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Her careful but unwavering defence of the island's sovereign status led to China suspending formal communications with Taiwan - Beijing  said it was because of Taiwan's refusal to accept the One China principle, which is the belief that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and will be unified with it one day. Things got worse in 2022, when then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taipei infuriated Beijing - it staged elaborate military drills in the Taiwan Strait that resembled a near-blockade of the island. Later that year, the US said Xi Jinping had sped up the timeline for unification. During this time, Taiwan has grown close to the US, including securing billions of dollars in new weapons from Washington. The DPP's vice-president William Lai, who had been pegged as the frontrunner in the presidential race before polling stopped on 2 January, is deeply disliked by Beijing. It sees him as an advocate for Taiwan independence, based on his younger, more vocal days, but he now rejects that description. If the DPP wins an unprecedented third straight term, Beijing could up the ante on military pressure in the Taiwan Strait. It could also cut internet cables or supply routes to outlying Taiwanese islands. Mr Xi and his foreign minister Wang Yi have repeatedly warned that the Chinese military is prepared to take Taiwan by force if necessary. But many experts believe that the prospect of a full-blown war is low, at least for now, given how much it would cost China when its own economy is struggling. Any escalation between China and Taiwan runs the risk of turning into something bigger and more dangerous - the US has a big naval presence in the region, and bases from Australia in the south to Japan in the north. Washington is yet to clarify exactly what form its support will take in the event of a Chinese attack - and it's unclear if Japan, which hosts the largest concentration of US troops in the region, will itself fight. Washington hopes the possibility of its involvement will deter Chinese aggression. And many analysts say Beijing also wants to avoid conflict, pointing to its refrain of ""peaceful unification"". Managing these many possibilities and alliances - and crucially the US relationship, which could very well change if Donald Trump wins the presidency - will fall to Taiwan's next president. The US has said a win for the opposition - Kuomintang (KMT) - could increase Chinese sway over Taiwan. But analysts say a Lai presidency also worries Washington. If it happens, a war in Taiwan would be devastating - both in its human toll and as a blow to the island's democracy. It would also devastate the global economy. Close to half of the world's container ships pass through the Taiwan Strait every year, making it a critical hub for international trade. Taiwan also makes most of the semiconductors that power modern life, from cars to refrigerators to phones. Any disruption to this would paralyse the global supply chain. Sanctions against China would only aggravate the damage to the global economy. According to several estimates, a complete disruption of China's trade would reduce world trade in added value by $2.6tn, or 3% of the world's gross domestic product. Mending ties with China, Taiwan's biggest threat but also its biggest trade partner, is a top agenda for whoever governs the island. Cost of living and jobs are major domestic issues on the ballot. Analysts expect a divided government, where the executive and legislative will be controlled by different parties. Despite the possibility of political gridlock, some are hopeful that a more experienced DPP and a less powerful KMT could strike the right balance between spurring the economy and keeping peace with China.","['Taiwan', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15286/production/_132226668_gettyimages-1899609294.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13925/production/_132256108_gettyimages-1905876483.jpg']",['Kelly Ng'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67920168,China satellite launch triggers air raid alert in Taiwan ahead of election,Taiwan issued an islandwide air raid alert after a Chinese satellite flew over its southern airspace days before a crucial presidential election.,2024-01-09,"Taiwan issued an islandwide air raid alert after a Chinese satellite flew over its southern airspace days before a crucial presidential election. Mobile phone users across the self-ruled island received a message warning them to ""be aware for your safety"". The ""presidential alert"" underlined jitters ahead of pivotal presidential and legislative elections on Saturday. China has long claimed Taiwan as part of its own territory and has been accused of interfering in the vote. The self-governing island of 23 million people, is a key flashpoint in the tussle between China and the US for supremacy in Asia. Analysts say the elections will shape the trajectory of ties between Beijing and Washington. The satellite was launched off the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China's Sichuan province at 15:03 local time, Taiwan's defence ministry said. At about the same time as the alert, China's CCTV announced that a satellite named Einstein Probe had been launched with ""complete success"". Taiwan's foreign minister Joseph Wu said the launch of a satellite over Taiwanese airspace so close to the election is a ""greyzone"" activity, Reuters news agency reported. ""When a rocket is openly flying in our sky, some of their tubes or debris will fall in this region,"" said Mr Wu, who was at a news conference when the alert was sent. ""That's the reason why our national alert centre will issue this kind of alert. It has happened before."" Taiwan said its defence ministry was tracking the trajectory of the satellite to ""appropriately alert and respond"" to the situation. The satellite was at high altitude when it crossed Taiwan's airspace, the ministry said. Taiwanese media say this is the first time its government has flashed an islandwide alert of this nature. Eric Chu, the chairman of Taiwan's main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), accused the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) government of fear-mongering, especially with the use of the term ""missile"" in the English version of the alert. It read: ""[Air raid alert] Missile flyover Taiwan airspace, be aware."" ""This is the first time I heard that launching a satellite can trigger such an alert. Everyone was possibly shocked, thinking it was a missile, but it turned out to be a satellite... So I think the Ministry of National Defense is trying to mislead the public by issuing such an alert,"" he said. Taiwan's defence ministry later apologised for its inaccurate reference to a missile in the message to mobile phones. According to the European Space Agency, the Einstein Probe is a partnership between the agency, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. The satellite will ""observe mysterious transient phenomena in the universe comparable to the flickering of fireworks, with the aim of unveiling the violent and little-known aspects of the cosmos"", China's Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. In December, Taiwanese media had also reported on Chinese carrier rockets passing over the island. A Focus Taiwan report published on 10 December said a carrier rocket, also launched from Xichang had passed over southwestern Taiwan in outer space.","['Taiwan', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8453/production/_132257833_einsteinprobe_gettyimages-1910985769.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16ACB/production/_132257829_8523b273-a42a-40bf-bf48-83af2bb942ed.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3633/production/_132257831_6179795a-4e83-4ece-a0fe-11b7cc3a3ffa.jpg']",['Kelly Ng'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67678707,How some Indian hospitals are cutting cancer drug costs,"Scores of patients quietly fill a modest tin shed which serves as a waiting area at a cancer hospital in Silchar, in north-eastern India.",2024-01-09,"Scores of patients quietly fill a modest tin shed which serves as a waiting area at a cancer hospital in Silchar, in north-eastern India. Over the last few months, Cachar Cancer Centre in the state of Assam has seen an unusually high number of patients from nearby towns and villages. The reason: a quiet revolution that is making cancer drugs more affordable. The hospital is part of the National Cancer Grid, a group of treatment centres that have clubbed together to bulk buy drugs and bring down costs by more than 85%. It is a modest start but, literally, a lifesaver for some of the country's poorest people. Expensive, protracted treatments often put families under immense financial strain or are simply out of reach. For example, breast cancer treatments can extend for over 10 cycles and cost more than $6,000 (£4,719). In a country where the average monthly salary is less than $700, that is beyond many household budgets. Baby Nandi, 58, is waiting for her next chemotherapy session at the Cachar hospital clinic. Previously, she had to travel 2,000km (1,242 miles) for breast cancer treatment. The drugs alone cost $650 for one treatment cycle. She needed six cycles. Along with the travel and accommodation costs, her family's finances were pushed to the brink. Thanks to the new initiative, those drugs are now available in her home city, Silchar, at a third of the cost. Baby's husband Narayan Nandi said: ""We don't have so much money at a go. I had to sell land and borrow from my relatives to take her to Chennai. At least now we can afford her full treatment and be home."" Nearly two million cancer cases are reported a year in India, but consultancy firm EY says that the actual figure could be up to three times as high. Most people in India have to pay for healthcare themselves. Even for those with insurance or on government schemes, cancer care costs are often not fully covered. Amal Chandra, the owner of a small shop in rural Assam, knows the problem well. Last year his wife's government health card, which covered $1,800 of health expenses, expired midway through her breast cancer treatment. ""I had to borrow $250 to pay for her remaining chemotherapy injections,"" he told the BBC. Amal and his wife are now back at the hospital as her cancer has returned but at least now the whole cost of her treatment is covered after the prices of drugs was brought down. A major issue is that most of India's cancer patients live in towns and rural areas, while the bulk of healthcare resources are in larger cities. This means that patients, like Mrs Nandi, and their families face the added burden of having to travel long distances to access treatment. Healthcare experts say that getting cancer drugs to these parts of the country is one of the healthcare system's biggest problems. Cachar Cancer Hospital, the only facility of its kind in India's North-eastern hills, is trying to meet that challenge. It treats 5,000 new patients a year and manages the ongoing treatment of another 25,000 people, who are mainly low-paid workers unable to afford the cost of cancer treatment and travel. The intense pressure this puts on the not-for-profit organisation's funding means it faces a budget deficit of more than $20,000 a month. Oncologist Dr Ravi Kannan, who leads the hospital's operations, told the BBC that the initiative to cut cancer drug prices has helped him to buy quality medicines and treat more patients for free. It has also helped hospitals in smaller towns avoid another serious problem - running out of cancer drugs. Previously, drug supplies outside large urban centres were erratic due to the low numbers of patients and limited funds. ""Now smaller hospitals don't have to get into the negotiation table at all. The price is already decided and comes with a commitment to supply to all hospitals at par,"" Dr Kannan said. The initiative to bulk-buy drugs is led by the country's largest cancer centre, Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) in Mumbai. The initial list had 40 common off-patent generic drugs, covering 80% of their pharmacy costs, saving the group $170m. The success of the scheme has attracted interest from hospitals and state governments across the country. The next round will expand to over 100 drugs, while broader cancer care purchases like supplies, diagnostics and equipment are also being considered. However, more expensive patented treatments are currently not part of the plan. ""I think what pharmaceutical companies need to understand is in a market like India, unless you bring costs down, you're not going to get the volumes and it's a chicken and the egg phenomenon,"" according to Dr C S Pramesh, Director of TMH and the Convenor of National Cancer Grid. Dr Pramesh also says that with around 70% of global cancer deaths projected to be in lower and middle income countries, like India, initiatives similar to the National Cancer Grid could be key to helping patients around the world.","['Cancer', 'Medicine', 'India']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17A5E/production/_132226869_cancerhospitalcacharassam1.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/617B/production/_132255942_babynandipatient1.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E61/production/_132256002_drkannan1.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3A6B/production/_132255941_patientbuyingfrompharmacy.png']",['Archana Shukla'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67909348,Bilkis Bano: India Supreme Court cancels release of 2002 riots rapists,"Eleven men freed early after being found guilty of gang raping a pregnant Muslim woman must be returned to prison, India's Supreme Court has said.",2024-01-09,"Eleven men freed early after being found guilty of gang raping a pregnant Muslim woman must be returned to prison, India's Supreme Court has said. Part of a Hindu mob, the men were serving life terms for the attack on Bilkis Bano, as well as the murder of 14 of her family members, during anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state in 2002. However, they were released in August 2022 by order of Gujarat's government. The order, and the celebrations as they left prison, caused global outrage. The article contains details that some readers may find disturbing Ms Bano said she had ""wept tears of relief"" on hearing that the decision to free her attackers had been overturned. She thanked the Supreme Court ""for giving me, my children and women everywhere this vindication and hope in the promise of equal justice for all"". She had petitioned the court after men were released. The two-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice BV Nagarathna, ruled that the state of Gujarat was ""not competent"" to pass the remission order in the case since the men had been tried and convicted in a court in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra. The bench added that since the government's remission order had been nullified, the 11 convicts must return to prison within two weeks. ""Justice encompasses not just the rights of the convicts but also the rights of the victims"" and the ""primary duty"" of the court is to uphold justice and rule of law, Justice Nagarathna said, adding that the ""rule of law must be preserved unmindful of the ripples of the consequences"". The landmark judgement is expected to create ripples, especially in Gujarat where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister at the time of the riots and was criticised for not doing enough to prevent the carnage. He has always denied wrongdoing and has not apologised for what happened in the riots. Gujarat's state government had sought the federal government's approval to release the men sentenced for attacking Ms Bano and her family. It was granted by the home ministry, led by Mr Modi's close aide Amit Shah. State officials said in court that the 11 men - first convicted by a trial court in 2008 - had spent more than 14 years in jail and were released after factors such as their age and good behaviour in prison were taken into consideration. When the men were freed in 2022 they were given a heroes' welcome as they left the jail in Godhra, with relatives giving them sweets and touching their feet to show respect. Federal prosecutors had argued they should not be ""released prematurely and no leniency may be shown"" to them as their crime was ""heinous, grave and serious"". After her attackers were freed, Bilkis Bano said the decision to release them had ""shaken her faith in justice"". ""How can justice for any woman end like this? I trusted the highest courts in our land. I trusted the system, and I was learning slowly to live with my trauma,"" she wrote, appealing to the Gujarat government to ""undo this harm"". The attack on Ms Bano and her family was one of the most horrific crimes during the riots, which began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a fire on a passenger train in the town of Godhra. Blaming Muslims for starting the fire, Hindu mobs attacked Muslim neighbourhoods. Over three days, more than 1,000 people died, most of them Muslims. The morning after the train fire, Ms Bano - then 19 and pregnant with her second child - was visiting her parents in a village called Randhikpur near Godhra with her three-year-old daughter. When rioters attacked the village and started setting Muslim homes on fire, she and 16 relatives went on the run, she told the BBC in 2017. Over the next few days, they sought shelter in mosques or subsisting on the kindness of Hindu neighbours. On the morning of 3 March 2002, a group of men attacked them ""with swords and sticks"". ""One of them snatched my daughter from my lap and threw her on the ground, bashing her head into a rock."" Her attackers were her neighbours, men she had seen almost daily while growing up. They tore off her clothes and several of them raped her, ignoring her pleas for mercy. Her cousin, who had given birth two days earlier, was raped and murdered and her newborn baby was killed too. Bilkis Bano survived because she lost consciousness and her attackers left, believing she was dead. Two boys - seven and four - were the only other survivors of the massacre. Her fight for justice has been long and nightmarish. It has been well documented that some police and state officials tried to intimidate her, evidence was destroyed and the dead were buried without post-mortem exams. The doctors who examined her said she hadn't been raped, and she received death threats. The first arrests in the case were made only in 2004 after India's Supreme Court handed over the case to federal investigators and transferred her case to Mumbai saying that courts in Gujarat could not deliver justice to her. Over the years, the courts have convicted dozens of people for involvement in the riots, but some high-profile accused won bail or were exonerated by higher courts. This included Maya Kodnani, an ex-minister in Mr Modi's Gujarat cabinet, whom a trial court had called ""a kingpin of the riots"" that took place in one area. In 2013, a Supreme Court panel ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Modi, who became prime minister the following year. But critics have continued to blame him for the riots happening on his watch.","['Asia', 'India']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15E42/production/_95966698_gettyimages-680237412.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E912/production/_95966695_gettyimages-98083379.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CDBA/production/_95966625_gettyimages-52003110.jpg']",['Geeta Pandey'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-67914611,"MI6 spy detained in China, authorities claim","Chinese authorities say they have detained an individual alleged to be spying for Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6.",2024-01-09,"Chinese authorities say they have detained an individual alleged to be spying for Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6. China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) said the individual was a foreigner and was trying to collect information inside the country. It is the latest arrest in a campaign by Chinese security to clamp down on foreign spying. The British government has not commented on the claims. The news of the arrest came in a statement issued in a post from the MSS on the WeChat social network. It said the alleged spy was named ""Huang"" and came from a ""third country,"" implying they were neither British nor Chinese. It said consular visits had been arranged following the arrest but did not say from which country. China has increasingly been publicising cases of alleged espionage by Western countries. Previous cases have focused on alleged activity by the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - so accusing Britain's MI6 is more unusual. Beijing has also launched public campaigns to raise awareness of foreign spying and calling on people to report any activity. In this latest case, the MSS alleged that in 2015, MI6 recruited the foreign national to create what was described as an ""intelligence cooperation relationship"". It said that after their recruitment, MI6 instructed them to go to China on multiple occasions and use their job as cover to collect intelligence and recruit other individuals. It claimed that they were provided with professional intelligence training in the UK and other locations and also equipped with specialist spy equipment to communicate. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the claims. The UK government has a policy of neither confirming nor denying claims relating to intelligence issues. The statement said the individual who had been detained was the head of a consulting agency overseas. China has been engaged in a crackdown on foreign business consultants operating in the country. It has accused some firms of trying to obtain information about Chinese businesses and gathering information which is sensitive or related to national security. Last year there were reports of raids, visits and arrests linked to companies like the US consulting firm Bain & Company. That led some companies to change the way they operate in China. Last July, a new anti-espionage law also came into effect which broadened the type of information that is covered and the types of activity which people could be prosecuted over. China said that official assessments indicated the arrested individual had provided MI6 with nine pieces of information considered secret and five considered confidential as well as three other pieces of intelligence. The MSS statement said the case had been uncovered ""recently"" after a ""meticulous investigation"" and that ""criminal enforcement measures"" had been taken under the law. The US has regularly accused China of spying and stealing business secrets. In 2022 an MSS officer was, for the first time, sentenced to jail in the US after having been arrested in Belgium. The UK has also become more vocal about Chinese intelligence activities. In October, Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, the UK's domestic security service, described a ""pretty epic"" campaign of Chinese espionage. Speaking to the BBC at an event in the US designed to highlight concerns over China, he said more than 20,000 people in the UK had been approached covertly online by Chinese spies. MI5 has also accused China of trying to interfere in parliament and political life, issuing an ""interference alert"" two years ago.",['Spying'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/609E/production/_132243742_chinauk.png'],['Gordon Corera'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67920023,Samsung warns of worse than expected profits fall,Technology giant Samsung Electronics says it is likely to see its profits for the last three months of 2023 fall by more than a third.,2024-01-09,"Technology giant Samsung Electronics says it is likely to see its profits for the last three months of 2023 fall by more than a third. The decline is much worse than analysts expected and comes as global demand for consumer electronics remains weak. South Korea-based Samsung is the world's largest maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions. The company is scheduled to release a detailed financial earnings report on 31 January. Samsung estimated that its operating profit fell to 2.8 trillion won ($2.13bn: £1.76bn) in the October-December quarter, 35% lower compared to the same period in 2022. It is much less than the roughly 3.7 trillion won expected by technology industry analysts. Demand for electronic gadgets and the memory chips that go in them ramped up during Covid lockdowns as consumers bought new devices to use at home. However, memory chip prices dropped sharply last year. This was because of a build up of large stocks of the key electronic components in the wake of the pandemic, and slower sales for devices such as laptops and mobile phones. That had a major impact on Samsung's earnings as it saw its operating profit for the third quarter of 2023 fall by more than 77% compared to the same period a year earlier. In the previous quarter, the same measure of profitability plunged by 95%, which triggered Samsung to cut the number of memory chips it planned to make. ""We are lowering the production of memory chips by a meaningful level, especially that of products with supply secured,"" the company said at the time. Samsung's warning on Tuesday comes as CES, the world's biggest consumer technology trade show, gets underway in Las Vegas. As well as being a shop window for the latest innovations, it also marks an annual gathering of the biggest players in the technology industry. Around 130,000 visitors and 4,000 exhibitors are expected at this year's event.","['Semiconductors', 'Samsung']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/172EB/production/_132255949_capture.jpg'],['N/A'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67889387,Bangladesh election: PM Sheikh Hasina wins fourth term in controversial vote,Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has secured her fourth straight term in a controversial election.,2024-01-09,"Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has secured her fourth straight term in a controversial election. Ms Hasina will serve another five years in office after her party the Awami League and its allies won 223 of 300 parliamentary seats contested. With the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party boycotting the poll, Ms Hasina's party and allies are expected to win the remaining seats as well. The BNP alleged the poll was a sham. Sunday's result comes after mass arrests of BNP leaders and supporters. Official figures suggested a low voter turnout of about 40%, though critics say even those numbers may be inflated. In comparison, the last election in 2018 had a voter turnout of more than 80%. Political analyst Badiul Alam Majumder told the BBC that the election commission was inflating the voter turnout. ""From different sources and media reports, we have seen that the turnout (provided by the election commission) doesn't match with the reality,"" he said. Independents, almost all of them from the Awami League itself, won 45 seats and the Jatiya Party won eight seats. Results are expected to be announced officially later on Monday. It is the fifth term in total for Ms Hasina, who first became prime minister in 1996 and was re-elected in 2009, remaining in power since. ""I am trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country,"" she told reporters as she cast her vote. Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader told reporters that Ms Hasina had instructed party leaders and supporters not to hold victory processions or indulge in celebrations. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimates that nearly 10,000 activists were arrested after an opposition rally on 28 October turned violent, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 people and injuring more than 5,500. It accused the government of ""filling prisons with the ruling Awami League's political opponents"". The Awami League has denied these accusations. Fears have been raised that this new victory for the Awami League could lead to de-facto one party rule. Very few expect the government to relax its crackdown - particularly if opposition parties and civil society groups continue to raise questions over the legitimacy of the government. The BNP boycotted the election after the Awami League rejected their demands for an independent caretaker government to preside over the polls. Until then, ""our peaceful and non-violent movement will vigorously continue,"" Tarique Rahman, the acting chairman of the BNP, told the BBC by email from London where he has lived since 2008. Mr Rahman, who is the son of Ms Hasina's bitter rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, also denied accusations that BNP party workers were involved in arson attacks in the run up to the poll. Ms Zia is currently under house arrest on charges of corruption. In 2018 Mr Rahman was convicted in absentia of orchestrating a grenade attack on a campaign rally for Ms Hasina in 2004 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Ms Hasina was injured and at least 20 others were killed in that incident. ""All allegations against me are baseless and rooted in political vengeance,"" he said. The BNP also called on people to not cast their votes. But Ms Hasina's supporters insist she has provided much-needed political stability for Bangladesh. ""We have continued the democratic process which has given this political stability. I think the world should credit Sheikh Hasina for that,"" says Law Minister Anisul Huq. Ms Hasina's single biggest achievement in the past 15 years ""is the confidence that she has ushered in in the minds of the people of Bangladesh. They have come to believe in themselves,"" he added. Bangladesh under Ms Hasina presents a contrasting picture. The Muslim-majority nation, once one of the world's poorest, has achieved credible economic success under her leadership since 2009. It's now one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, even surpassing its giant neighbour India. Its per capita income has tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years. It is also the world's second largest garment producer after China. But the economy spun into turmoil in mid-2022 following the pandemic and a global economic slowdown. With rising inflation and conditions for an IMF loan it took earlier kicking in, the government may struggle to tackle public fallout. International pressure is also kicking in. In September, Washington began imposing visa restrictions on Bangladeshi officials found culpable of undermining the country's democratic election process. The UN and other international organisations have also expressed alarm over human rights abuses and the stifling of dissent. But Ms Hasina is aware that as long as India backs her, any threat of major sanctions by the West can be countered. Developed countries are also aware that any withdrawal of concessions to Bangladesh's garment industry would hit millions of workers, most of whom are women. Ms Hasina first became the country's prime minister in 1996. She was re-elected in 2009 and has stayed in power since, making her the longest-serving leader in Bangladesh's history. By the end of her term as prime minister, she will be 81. Who will succeed her is a big question for many in Bangladesh, including supporters of the Awami League. As some analysts say, ""the election result was clear, but the future looks uncertain"".","['Bangladesh', 'Asia', 'Sheikh Hasina']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8BCE/production/_132209753_547e8bfd25f3c15ff38bf91c8b424eccbe492b530_0_4099_24641000x601.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1280E/production/_132209757_gettyimages-1553913077.jpg']","['Ethirajan Anbarasan', 'Kelly Ng']",World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67909071,Taiwan election: Kuomintang party asks voters to choose between war and peace,"The rock music was booming, the dancers on stage were gyrating, and the crowd was going wild waving thousands of Taiwan flags.",2024-01-09,"The rock music was booming, the dancers on stage were gyrating, and the crowd was going wild waving thousands of Taiwan flags. The political rally held on Saturday for the Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate for the 13 January presidential election was in full swing. ""Give me a president!"" shouted the host. ""Hou You-ih!"" the crowd roared. As Mr Hou looked on, his running mate Jaw Shaw-kong took the microphone and launched a broadside against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). ""What road are they taking? The road to war!"" he said, wagging his finger. ""The road that leads Taiwan into danger, the road that leads to uncertainty!"" As Taiwan edges closer to the election this weekend, the KMT is banking on convincing voters they face a choice between war and peace with China. Beijing claims the self-ruled island as its own, and while it promotes ""peaceful reunification"" it has also not ruled out the use of force in taking Taiwan. In the last eight years of pro-sovereignty DPP rule, China has relentlessly ramped up its military presence around Taiwan, conducting what is known as greyzone warfare. The DPP has countered that they also want peace and stability - while maintaining Taiwan's path of progress. A recent viral campaign advertisement showed outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen calmly driving on quiet country roads with her party's presidential candidate William Lai. She then gets out and Mr Lai takes the wheel with his running mate Hsiao Bi-Khim by his side.  ""Drive better than me,"" Ms Tsai urges them. But some are sceptical he can do the job. At the KMT rally in Taoyuan, an area known for its hardcore supporters, many of those interviewed by the BBC were more concerned with the economy and cost of living. But relations with China also loomed large. ""I didn't use to think there could be war, but now we have this possibility and it's scary. The DPP is just too aggressive, I want to go back to peace with the KMT,"" said Ms Shi, a 45-year-old service worker accompanying her parents. ""We need to learn from China and how they take care of their citizens. Look at their high-speed railways, their infrastructure. China is so advanced, even their phones are better. We don't have that,"" said a 58-year-old woman named Ms Tu. ""I'm not really saying we should unify, but we should be working together more. We share the same ideals, and we are the same people as China,"" said KMT party member Mr Li. Decades ago, the KMT fought the Chinese Communist Party, its bitter enemy in the Chinese civil war, before fleeing to Taiwan in defeat. Now it favours warmer ties. This largely has to do with the increasing intertwining of their economies. As the biggest buyer of Taiwanese exports, China has become an important economic lifeline. Hundreds of thousands of ""taishang"", Taiwanese businessmen, depend on the mainland for their livelihood. Many taishang are part of the KMT's traditional supporter base. Within the KMT, whose party colour is blue, the ""deep blue"" faction that advocates the closest ties with China still holds significant power. Many of them are descendants of the so-called 1949 generation which fled from China that year when Mao Zedong's communist army took control. They still have strong emotional ties to the mainland. In recent years though, the KMT has faced an increasingly difficult balancing act. Even as it seeks close ties with China, it wants to remain relevant to an electorate that is increasingly distancing itself from the mainland. After decades in power in Taiwan, it has lost some recent elections to the DPP. Polls consistently show that most Taiwanese see themselves as possessing a unique Taiwanese identity and prefer the status quo - neither declaring independence nor unifying with the mainland. The KMT has had to dial down its message, insisting it is not ""pro-China"" but rather pursuing friendlier relations. It has fielded Mr Hou as its presidential candidate, an ex-cop seen as a ""light blue"" moderate and a ""benshengren"" who comes from a local Taiwanese family.  In recent days Mr Hou responded to Xi Jinping's renewed vow of unification saying he would ""forever protect Taiwan's democratic system"" and freedoms. Similarly Mr Jaw, a firebrand ""deep blue"" media personality who has in the past advocated unification, said recently that China and Taiwan's systems were ""too different"" and promised voters he would not push for it if he became vice-president. But the KMT is still seen as running several risks. For one, its rhetoric closely echoes China's language, which may not be a good look to some voters. Top Chinese official Song Tao said in November that the two sides were facing ""a choice between war and peace, prosperity and decline"". This prompted the DPP government to claim that China was using the narrative to influence Taiwan in the lead-up to the election. Beijing has also made its preferences clear, calling the DPP's Mr Lai a ""separatist"" and ""troublemaker"". Another risk is that it is not clear whether a KMT government would necessarily be able to appease Beijing and guarantee peace. ""The KMT believes that it can get Beijing to promise restraint and stick to it. Looking at China's position on Hong Kong, I'm less sure about Beijing's willingness to commit to anything,"" said Ian Chong, a non-resident scholar at Carnegie China. ""If KMT wins, maybe temporarily Beijing will ease off. But ultimately they want control of Taiwan, either through economic dependence, or show of force and intimidation."" This also represents a problem for the KMT in the long term. With each generation, the gulf widens between what voters want for Taiwan's relationship with China, and what the KMT has stood for. The war and peace narrative is ""the reflection of a party trying to reconcile two different sides of itself and trying to present a coherent argument to voters,"" said Dr Chong. ""But there is also a natural tension between where the KMT is going as a party and where voters are going. They will have to decide what kind of party they are: the Chinese Nationalist Party?"" he said, referring to the Kuomintang's official English name. ""Or is it happy to be a Taiwan nationalist party?""","['Taiwan', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0D86/production/_132226430_4acb79751c3d2c0ed91596f643a8e42bf24c885f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DC98/production/_132227465_thumbnail_image002.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8E78/production/_132227463_fd680dec2ce3312c37c571d51c30918b861d3fa0.jpg']",['Tessa Wong'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67891869,Taiwan election: China sows doubt about US with disinformation,"The rumour was old, but effective: the Taiwanese were being fed ""poisonous"" pork imported from the US.",2024-01-09,"The rumour was old, but effective: the Taiwanese were being fed ""poisonous"" pork imported from the US. The weeks-old claim followed another: the Taiwanese government was secretly harvesting blood from citizens and giving it to the US to make a bioweapon to attack China. Both were swiftly debunked. But this is a narrative that has been blooming in Taiwan ahead of Saturday's presidential and legislative elections. ""Yimeilun"" or US scepticism, questions the faithfulness of Taiwan's biggest ally, portraying the island as a pawn exploited by America. Its ultimate goal, say analysts, is to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the US - and push the Taiwanese into the welcoming arms of China. ""There seems to be this narrative that the US will not support Taiwan, or will abandon it if there's a war, or the situation is not advantageous to the US,"" said Kuang-shun Yang, a disinformation researcher who coined the term in 2018. Disinformation experts say China has a hand in spreading this message, and may even be creating it. Their evidence also points to Taiwanese close to Beijing. It's not always conspiracy theories - most of the time it's a highlighting of news that shows the US in a bad light, or points to it as an untrustworthy superpower. ""For China, this is a battle for public opinion,"" said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese expert in Chinese disinformation and Democratic Progressive Party's legislature nominee. ""To persuade everyone that China is the better country is more difficult, but to persuade everyone that America is problematic is relatively easier… to China that would be considered a success."" When Taiwanese chip giant TSMC expanded in the US, it was described as American coercion and a ""hollowing out"" of Taiwan's resources. And the US' arms sale to Taiwan was deemed as ""cheating"" the island of its money by sending it unreliable weapons. These were among 84 types of US scepticism narratives discovered by think tank IORG between 2021 and 2023 on Chinese-language media outlets, social media, online forum PTT and messaging platform LINE. Chinese provincial governments' propaganda departments and state media outlets amplified these narratives and in some cases were even the first-known sources. But most of the sources were Taiwanese politicians and media organisations friendly to China. There has long been suspicion of Chinese state influence and a 2019 Reuters report found evidence of mainland officials paying Taiwanese outlets for coverage. The bioweapons rumour first surfaced in an unsubstantiated Taiwanese newspaper report which some suggested involved Beijing. The US pork rumour began with online posts claiming, with no evidence, that the government was secretly passing off US pork as Taiwanese. Weeks later, others made the claim about poisonous US pork products that was traced to an old debunked report by a pro-China Hong Kong newspaper. The idea that US pork could be unsafe has dogged discussions in Taiwan for years. But it has returned right in time for what appears to be a tight presidential race. Mr Shen estimates that any disinformation campaign would only need to convince about 3% of voters to affect the outcome of the election. In the lead-up to the last election, in 2020, Taiwan saw a massive wave of anti-DPP disinformation that was believed to have come from China. Though it eventually failed - President Tsai Ing-wen won her second term by a landslide - it deeply alarmed many Taiwanese. But the political landscape has since changed. For one, tensions with China have spiked - Beijing has repeatedly reinforced unification as a goal, offering peace while not ruling out the use of force. And two, faith in the US is dwindling. Polls show the Taiwanese public still trusts the US far more than China. But the annual American Portrait survey conducted by Taiwanese academics found that last year only 34% of Taiwanese believe the US is a trustworthy country, compared to 45% in 2021. Another survey by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation found that 51% of Taiwanese in their early 20s identify with US scepticism narratives, the highest among all age groups. The polling organisation said one possible reason was because younger Taiwanese were more likely to be sent to the frontlines of any possible war. Most of this could be chalked up to America's own actions. The disastrous troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and a divided Congress' reluctance to continue funding Ukraine in its war, have contributed to Taiwanese fears that America would abandon it or fail to intervene if China attacks, say analysts. In 2021 Jaw Shaw-kong, the Kuomintang's vice-presidential candidate who has called for closer ties with China and promoted US scepticism, warned that ""if Taiwan does not want to become a second Afghanistan, then it has to think clearly if it wants war or peace"". US scepticism has also played a role in ""seeding"" doubt, said Chihhao Yu, the author of the IORG study. ""And then when the US makes a mistake, it would confirm previous suspicions."" Like other propaganda and disinformation, US scepticism too thrives on fear, whether it is about food safety or the threat of war. But it also mines something fundamental in the Taiwanese psyche: a decades-long insecurity about their relationship with America. This stems from Taiwan's ""orphan mentality"",  Mr Yang said. ""Taiwan was a colony of many empires, transferred again and again by its previous rulers. That historical perspective has always resided in the collective memory. ""But the most direct trigger was in 1979."" That was the year the US stunned the world and dismayed Taiwan when it formalised diplomatic relations with China after months of secret negotiations. By switching recognition from Taipei to Beijing, the US severed official ties with the island. But it also passed a law stating it must help Taiwan defend itself. To this day it maintains close informal relations with the island and sells it arms. But the diplomatic break-up planted the notion ""that Taiwan could be abandoned by the US again"", Mr Yang said. Such was the depth of hurt that it spawned a hit 1980s Taiwanese song called Orphan of Asia - it speaks of an ""orphan crying in the wind"" as ""the Western wind sings a sad song in the East"". This is why US scepticism often works in tandem with pro-China narratives as ""push and pull forces"" - encouraging Taiwan to engage more with China to guarantee peace, Mr Yang added. ""If Taiwan is an orphan, then it should be a prodigal son coming home to the great nation [of China], rather than remain as the subsidiary of the US."" American reassurances are the best antidotes to US scepticism, say analysts. ""If our ally can be more aware of the dangers of US scepticism and come out to reiterate the good aspects of our partnership… people would see that this [relationship] is good for us,"" Mr Yu said. ""China does this all the time, they talk about all the benefits Taiwan gets from China. But you don't see it that much in US policy messaging."" The island has bolstered its anti-disinformation defences with public education campaigns, reporting hotlines, and even AI chatbots that point out fake news. Taiwan's parliament also mulled anti-disinformation laws, though this sparked concerns of curbs on press freedom. But Taiwan is already estimated to be the most targeted place in the world for false information spread by foreign governments. Years of propaganda and disinformation have polarised society and created greater distrust of facts, according to Wei-ping Li, a researcher with anti-disinformation group Taiwan Factcheck Center. ""The problem is not so much the disinformation, it's people's attitude to information now… they will ask, can you even trust this? They will make a judgment about the credibility of the information based on their party affiliation or political views,"" she said. As Taiwan gets better at defending itself, so will China get better at influencing discourse with more sophisticated methods, Mr Shen warned. Constant warnings from Taiwan's government about the dangers of Chinese influence, combined with Beijing's efforts at stigmatising criticism of China, has resulted in fatigue among ordinary Taiwanese, he said. ""These days even if we want to discuss China's issues, there will be people who will say… Why aren't you discussing America's issues?""

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67921298,"Fujitsu will be held accountable over Post Office scandal, says government","Fujitsu will be ""held accountable"" if it is found to have blundered in the Post Office scandal, the government has said.",2024-01-09,"Fujitsu will be ""held accountable"" if it is found to have blundered in the Post Office scandal, the government has said. Over 700 Post Office branch managers were prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. So far, the spotlight has been on the Post Office and politicians' actions. But attention is now turning to Fujitsu, the firm behind the software. Fujitsu said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Calls are growing for the Japanese firm to explain its role and to pay compensation to victims. Questions are also being asked over why the firm has continued to win government contracts, despite the cloud of the Post Office scandal hanging over it. Fujitsu executives have been asked to appear before MPs at a parliamentary committee hearing next week, and will also face questioning at the independent public inquiry looking into the matter, as pressure mounts on those involved in what is considered the biggest miscarriage of justice in British legal history. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""Once the inquiry is able to establish the facts and sets them out, those who are found responsible will be held to account, whether that is legally or financially."" The outcome of the inquiry could also influence any current and future contracts Fujitsu has with the UK government, the spokesman said. Fujitsu said it was fully committed to supporting the inquiry to learn from the events stretching back two decades. ""The inquiry has reinforced the devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families, and Fujitsu has apologised for its role in their suffering,"" the firm said. The inquiry has been under way since 2021 but hit the headlines after ITV aired a dramatisation of the events last week. It told the story of how more than 700 branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on faulty software, over 15 years. Around 100 new potential victims of the scandal have since come forward, prompted by the programme and subsequent coverage. Despite revelations around Fujitsu's role in providing and supporting the Horizon software, which falsely indicated sub-postmasters were taking money from the tills, the firm has continued to win government contracts over the last decade. Since 2013, the UK government has awarded Fujitsu 191 contracts worth more than £6.5bn, according to the procurement analysts Tussell, including: In 2022, the government removed Fujitsu from its list of preferred suppliers, but the firm is still able to win government contracts through the normal procurement process. The Horizon software at the centre of the mistaken prosecutions was originally developed by a British firm International Computers Limited (ICL) in the 1990s. ICL had been bought by Fujitsu in the 1980s after the Japanese government launched a campaign to counter the dominance of America's IBM on the world stage and gave financial support to three giant technology alliances, including Fujitsu. At the time, ICL had close ties with the UK government, but was struggling to keep up with its international competitors. Fujitsu saw an opportunity to gain a larger presence in the UK. However, even prior to Horizon, Fujitsu-developed software was the source of problems for the UK government. In 1999, the firm won a £184m contract to develop Libra - a software meant to standardise case management transactions across more than 300 magistrates' courts. In the end, it cost nearly three times more than expected, and the National Audit Office (NAO) concluded that it was not able to produce even basic financial information. Horizon was installed at the Post Office around the same time. But it was already clear there were weaknesses: it couldn't fulfil the requirements of its original project, an automated system for benefits payments announced in 1994. Then, there was an NHS lawsuit. Fujitsu was one of four companies tasked with digitising the NHS in 2004. But after repeated delays and failure to deliver the promised product, the NHS terminated its contract with Fujitsu in 2008. The Japanese company sued and won the case in 2014, which cost the UK government £700m. Some believe the government may be reluctant to engage in another long, and potentially expensive, legal battle. Even after the Horizon scandal, its products are deeply entrenched in the government's IT infrastructure. ""Its mainframes have been used for decades at HM Revenue and Customs and the largest department of all, the Department for Work and Pensions, has been pretty reliant on Fujitsu equipment,"" IT journalist Tony Collins, who has covered the industry for decades, told the BBC in 2022.","['Software', 'Post offices', 'Japan', 'Post Office Inquiry', 'Companies', 'Post Office Ltd']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10211/production/_132256066_1f57e93bedebbbcfaac4dc1254f46adcd82d29ac0_0_3000_20001000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B34B/production/_117999854_horizon.jpg']","['Sam Gruet', 'Mariko Oi']",World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16464515,"Profile: Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female president","Tsai Ing-wen made history in 2016 as Taiwan's first female president - now, as she prepares to leave office, her defence of Taiwan's sovereignty may arguably define her legacy.",2024-01-09,"Tsai Ing-wen made history in 2016 as Taiwan's first female president - now, as she prepares to leave office, her defence of Taiwan's sovereignty may arguably define her legacy. Her refusal to acknowledge ""The 1992 consensus"", the vaguely-worded agreement which says Taiwan is part of ""One China"", led Beijing to label her a separatist. She has also said China needs to show Taiwan respect and that Taipei will not bow to pressure. The 67-year-old's strong stance has won her admirers and detractors in equal measure. With three presidential candidates vying to replace Ms Tsai in Saturday's election, and Beijing keeping a watchful eye on proceedings, the question of how to deal with China remains a key issue at the ballot box. Yet China has not been the only threat to her years in office, with other policy decisions leaving some wondering if she would be a one-term president. Attempts to promote green energy ended with her being accused of nearly causing an electricity shortage, while the offer of two days off a week for all workers was rejected amid allegations of hurting, rather than increasing, workers' earnings and holidays. Making Taiwan the first Asian society where gay marriage is legal - a move which earned her plaudits around the world - also damaged her popularity at home. Whether she would even run for a second term was uncertain, with a former subordinate challenging for her party's nomination and - at one point - her approval rating hitting the 15% mark. But it seems that her biggest headache - China - was the very thing that helped her decisively win another four years in office in the January 2020 elections. Ms Tsai positioned herself as a defender of Taiwan's sovereignty against China's view that the island must one day be unified with the mainland. Her main rival from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, Han Kuo-yu, pushed for closer relations with China. But as anti-China protests swept Hong Kong in 2019, fears of what it could mean for Taiwan's future began to rise - as, it seems, did Ms Tsai's fortunes. Her campaign pushed the notion that her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would stand up to Beijing and keep Taiwan a liberal democracy. ""Choosing Tsai Ing-wen... means we choose our future and choose to stand with democracy and stand with freedom,"" Ms Tsai told reporters the day before the country went to the polls. In a landslide victory she took just over 57% of the ballot - more than eight million votes - with Mr Han trailing on 38%. Ms Tsai is the youngest of 11 children, born in a coastal village in the south of Taiwan. She moved to the capital Taipei when she was 11. Her mixed ethnicity - Hakka father and Taiwanese mother - has been cited as one of the traits that helped her connect to supporters. She also has a grandmother who is from one of the non-Chinese indigenous groups in Taiwan. A law graduate of the National Taiwan University, Ms Tsai completed her master's degree at Cornell University Law School in 1980 and went on to earn a doctorate from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1984. In the 1990s, she was a negotiator for Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization. She was then asked to serve on the National Security Council as an adviser to former President Lee Teng-hui. Ms Tsai joined the DPP in 2004 and rose quickly to become its chairwoman four years later, when the party suffered a heavy defeat in the presidential elections. Her predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, lost to Ma Ying-jeou at the polls in 2008, and was later jailed for corruption. It was her style and bearing when she appeared on the political scene which set her apart from the rest of the DPP ""old guard"", something that has worked to her advantage in attracting younger voters. Despite splits and factionalism in the party, Ms Tsai was able to rally the support she needed to rejuvenate the DPP. Under her leadership, it has performed much better in local elections. Her first attempt at running for president failed in 2012, but she continued to build on her successes. Four years later, she was elected. Her first term in office saw Taiwan's minimum wage, investments and stocks rise. Social services, including childcare and elderly care, and public housing also received a boost. But her second term saw Ms Tsai face a range of challenges. In November 2022,  she resigned as party chair after the DPP's poor showing in local elections centred on municipal issues. This was followed by economic annual growth figures in 2023 projecting annual growth at just 1.42% - the lowest since 2009. The government's statistics bureau cited a larger-than-expected decrease in exports and investment. Through it all, Beijing has loomed large, with Chinese President Xi Jinping repeatedly saying that Taiwan's ""reunification"" with China is inevitable. It has been more than just words. In August 2022, Beijing staged huge military drills around Taiwan in a protest against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island. It has also repeatedly rehearsed encircling the island with fighter jets and navy ships, while Chinese military aircraft probe the edge of Taiwan's airspace on an almost daily basis. As she leaves office, China remains one of the biggest issues on the ballot - but, as it has been throughout her tenure, not the only one. Rising costs, unaffordable housing and shrinking opportunities have also driven dissatisfaction against the DPP - and sent young voters into the arms of the Taiwan People's Party and its populist candidate, Ko Wen-je. Whoever becomes the next president of Taiwan will have his work cut out dealing with these various issues. But there is no doubt that, for better or for worse, Ms Tsai's policies have changed the conversation around China - perhaps permanently.","['Taiwan', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2B26/production/_110464011_0ddf946f-421d-4ce5-8e10-3db8f76c60e5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7946/production/_110464013_6a9a7bfa-4662-4c1c-85ca-2d272b998856.jpg']",['N/A'],World,Asia

The deputy ministers, who have been suspended, called Mr Modi a ""clown"", ""terrorist"" and a ""puppet of Israel"". A foreign ministry spokesperson said the comments were personal and did not represent the views of the government. Male's response came after the remarks set off an uproar and boycott calls on Indian social media . ""All government officials responsible for the comments have been suspended from their posts effective immediately"", a spokesperson for President Mohamed Muizzu's office told the BBC. There is already tension between India and the island nation after Mr Muizzu asked a contingent of about 75 Indian troops to leave the country after he came to power last year. The three suspended ministers are Malsha Shareef, Mariyam Shiuna and Abdulla Mahzoom Majid. Despite strong calls for their sacking, Maldivian media noted the three officials have been only suspended. The trio made the controversial comments in response to Mr Modi's post on X (formerly Twitter) which included photos promoting tourism to the Indian island chain of Lakshadweep. Ms Shiuna also compared India with cow dung. This sparked outrage on Indian social media and got hashtags such as #BoycottMaldives and #ExploreIndianIslands trending. Some said they would cancel their holidays to the Maldives - Indians were among the largest group of tourists who visited the Maldives last year. The CEO of Indian ticket-booking site EaseMyTrip said his company had suspended all flight bookings to the Maldives. The archipelago is famous for its silver sand beaches, resorts and coral islands. Prominent Indians, including Bollywood star Akshay Kumar as well as some cricketers, expressed dismay over the comments. Former Maldivian president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih strongly condemned what he termed as ""hateful language against India"" by the three officials. ""India has always been a good friend to Maldives, and we must not allow such callous remarks to negatively impact the age-old friendship between our two countries"", he said on X. Another former president Mohamed Nasheed called the language in the social media posts ""appalling"". The controversial posts were deleted following the uproar. On Monday, the Maldives's high commissioner to India, Ibrahim Shaheeb, was seen leaving the Indian foreign ministry's office in Delhi. India's envoy to Maldives also visited the country's foreign ministry on Monday but the country's High Commission said it was for a ""pre-arranged meeting"" to discuss bilateral issues. The controversy comes ahead of Mr Muizzu making a five-day state visit to India's rival China beginning Monday. Mr Muizzu's trip to Beijing is considered a high-profile snub to India as previous Maldivian leaders first visited India after being elected. He chose Turkey as his first international port of call after he took over in November. This will be seen as a diplomatic setback for Delhi, which is trying to match China's growing footprint in the Indian Ocean region. ""It is for them to decide where they go and how they go about their international relations,"" Indian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last week in response to questions on Mr Muizzu's visit to Beijing. He also said there was no update on the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Maldives. India says its security personnel are in the Maldives to maintain three maritime rescue and surveillance aircraft it had donated to the country. The Indian Ocean archipelago has long been under India's sphere of influence and Mr Muizzu wants to change that. In December, the Maldivian government said it was terminating a bilateral agreement with India that permitted Delhi to collaborate in mapping the seabed in Maldivian territorial waters. A Maldivian government spokesman said the deal, set to expire in June next year, would not be renewed. Soon after he won the elections in October last year, Mr Muizzu told the BBC he would review all the bilateral agreements signed with India by the previous administration of Mr Solih, who had adopted an India First policy. Delhi and Beijing are competing for a foothold in the strategically located islands.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12650940,Bangladesh country profile,"Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely-populated countries, with its people living in a delta of rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal.",2024-01-09,"Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely-populated countries, with its people living in a delta of rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal. Poverty is widespread, but Bangladesh has in recent years reduced population growth and improved health and education. Formerly East Pakistan, Bangladesh came into being only in 1971, when the two parts of Pakistan split after a bitter war which drew in neighbouring India. Bangladesh spent 15 years under military rule and, although democracy was restored in 1990, the political scene remains volatile. Islamist extremism has also been rising in the traditionally tolerant country. Bangladesh is low-lying and vulnerable to flooding and cyclones. It stands to be badly affected by any rise in sea levels. President: Mohammed Shahabuddin Mohammed Shahabuddin was elected unopposed in the 2023 presidential election. He was nominated by the ruling Awami League. Before being elected to the largely ceremonial post, he had served as a judge and as a  commissioner of the Anti-Corruption Commission. Prime minister: Sheikh Hasina Sheikh Hasina has secured her fourth straight term as prime minister in a controversial election in January 2024 - she has been prime minister since 1996. Her Awami League party and its allies won 223 of 300 parliamentary seats contested, amid a boycott by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and followed mass arrests of BNP leaders and supporters. Official figures suggested a low voter turnout of about 40%, though critics said even those numbers might have been inflated. In comparison, the last election in 2018 had a voter turnout of more than 80%. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimated that nearly 10,000 activists were arrested after an opposition rally on 28 October 2023 turned violent, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 people and injuring more than 5,500. It accused the government of ""filling prisons with the ruling Awami League's political opponents"". Fears have been raised that this new victory for the Awami League could lead to de-facto one party rule. Few observers expect the government to relax its crackdown - particularly if opposition parties and civil society groups continue to raise questions over the legitimacy of the government. The BNP boycotted the election after the Awami League rejected their demands for an independent caretaker government to preside over the polls. TV is the leading medium. State-run BTV has national terrestrial coverage and privately-owned satellite channels are widely watched. Media tend to be polarised, aligning themselves with one or other of the main political factions. Some key dates in the history of Bangladesh: 1204 - Muslim conquest of Bengal. 14th Century - Bengal sees the rise of three city-states: Sonargaon,  Satgaon and Lakhnauti. 1352 - Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah unites the three city-states into the  Bengal Sultanate, which dominates the area for much of the 14th, 15th and 16th Centuries. 17th Century - Mughal Empire controls Bengal. 18th Century - Nawabs of Bengal, within the Mughal Empire, become the de facto independent rulers of the area. 1757 - After the Battle of Plassey, Bengal is the first region of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British East India Company. 1947 - British colonial rule over India ends. A largely Muslim state comprising East and West Pakistan is established, either side of India. The two provinces are separated from each other by more than 1,500km of Indian territory. 1971 - Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) becomes independent after a war with West Pakistan - now just Pakistan - with India backing the Bengali nationalists against Pakistan. 1973 - First parliamentary elections give the Awami League a landslide victory. 1975 - A military coup sees founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members killed, putting an end to civilian rule. 1979 - Second parliamentary elections brings former army chief Ziaur Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party to power. 1981 - President Ziaur Rahman assassinated during abortive military coup. 1982 - General Hussain Muhammad Ershad assumes power in coup. He suspends the constitution and political parties. 1991 - The country returns to a parliamentary system of government. 2006-2008 - Political crisis sees leaders of both major parties briefly detained. 2014-17 - Bangladesh faces a campaign of violence by Islamists against bloggers, atheists and secular intellectuals.","['Bangladesh', 'Asia', 'Sheikh Hasina']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8A49/production/_128310453_bbcmp_bangladesh.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/903D/production/_132252963_gettyimages-1650328706.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1355D/production/_85979197_bangladesh_sheikh_hasina_g.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1837D/production/_85979199_bangladesh_farmer_g.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2839/production/_85979201_bangladesh_indian_troops_g.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/64D0/production/_129880852_gettyimages-1255217552.jpg']",['N/A'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538,What's behind China-Taiwan tensions?,At the heart of the issue is China's claim over self-governed Taiwan.,2024-01-09,"At the heart of the issue is China's claim over self-governed Taiwan. Beijing sees the island as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. Taiwan's first known settlers were Austronesian tribal people, believed to have come from modern day southern China. Chinese records appear to first mention the island in AD239, when an emperor dispatched an expeditionary force to it - a fact Beijing uses to back its territorial claim. After a relatively brief spell as a Dutch colony, Taiwan was administered by China's Qing dynasty, before it was ceded to Tokyo after Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War. After World War Two, Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China. Afterwards, Taiwan was officially considered occupied by the Republic of China (ROC), which began ruling with the consent of its allies, the US and UK. But in the next few years a civil war broke out in China, and then-leader Chiang Kai-shek's troops were defeated by Mao Zedong's Communist army. Chiang, the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government and their supporters - about 1.5m people -  fled to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang established a dictatorship that ruled Taiwan until the 1980s. Following his death, Taiwan began a transition to democracy and held its first elections in 1996. There is disagreement about the status of Taiwan. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang's ROC government-in-exile at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. But by the 1970s some countries began to argue that the Taipei government could no longer be considered a genuine representative of the people living in mainland China. In 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.  Once China began opening up its economy in 1978, the US recognised opportunities for trade and the need to develop relations. It formally established diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1979. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government has fallen drastically with only 12 countries recognising the island today. China exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan. Relations started improving in the 1980s as Taiwan relaxed rules on visits to and investment in China. In 1991, the ROC proclaimed that the war with the People's Republic of China was over. China proposed the so-called ""one country, two systems"" option, which it said would allow Taiwan significant autonomy if it agreed to come under Beijing's control. This system underpinned Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 and the manner in which it was governed until recently, when Beijing has sought to increase its influence. Taiwan rejected the offer, leading Beijing to insist the Taiwan's ROC government was illegitimate - but unofficial representatives from China and Taiwan still held limited talks. Then in 2000, Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian as president, much to Beijing's alarm. Mr Chen and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had openly backed Taiwan ""independence"". A year after Mr Chen was re-elected in 2004, China passed a so-called anti-secession law, declaring China's right to use ""non-peaceful means"" against Taiwan if it tried to ""secede"" from China. Mr Chen was later succeeded by the KMT, which favours closer relations with the PRC. In 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, from the DPP, was elected to the presidency. Under her, cross-strait relations have soured. China also cut off official communications with Taiwan after Ms Tsai took over, saying it was because of her refusal to endorse the concept of a single Chinese nation. Ms Tsai has never said she will formally declare Taiwan's independence, insisting that it is already independent. And now, relations with China are on the line again - and the world will be watching as Taiwan heads to the polls on 13th January. Many believe the results of the vote will push the island further towards - or away - from Beijing. Most Taiwanese people do not actually support immediate formal independence or unification with the PRC - but support some form of maintaining the status quo. Chinese President Xi has reiterated the message that China will ""surely be reunified"" with Taiwan, and has set 2049 as a target date for ""achieving the Chinese dream"". The US maintains official ties with Beijing, and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" - but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and US President Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily - breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. The island has long been one of the most contentious issue in US-China relations, with Beijing condemning any perceived support from Washington for Taipei. In 2022, after a visit to Taiwan by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi, China responded with an unprecedented show of force, carrying out military exercises around Taiwan in retaliation. Under President Xi, China has ramped up this ""grey zone warfare"" - sending record numbers of Chinese fighter jets near Taiwan and holding military drills in response to political exchanges between the US and Taiwan. In 2022, China's warplane incursions into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) nearly doubled. The results of the elections will shape the course of US-China relations - and no matter who walks away the winner, will have an indelible impact on the delicate relationship between the US, China and Taiwan.",['Taiwan'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0566/production/_105028310_2b415d5f-0c2d-4cf5-91e0-03757db4f1dd.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1F5A/production/_132262080_taiwan_china_locator_v2_2x640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1AA8/production/_86542860_f66cb468-70c1-4c09-adbe-c1850adfb74e.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A1A6/production/_105028314_deb2b8ef-22a8-4e0f-8c0c-cda59ce9df4f.jpg']",['N/A'],World,Asia

Efforts are continuing to find more than 100 people who remain missing a week later. But bad weather is hampering rescuers- with heavy rain and snow triggering warnings of landslides and building collapses. The 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the remote Noto peninsula - toppling buildings and sparking a major fire. The majority of the deaths have happened in the hard-hit cities of Wajima and Suzu. Meanwhile, the number of people missing has dropped from 195 to just over 100. The death toll has jumped from the 120 reported on Sunday. More than 2,000 people are reportedly still cut off due to massive damage to roads. Several others are living in emergency shelters. The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday that it had sent nearly 6,000 troops out to help with the relief mission. They added that they believe there are still people alive who need rescue and vowed to continue their lifesaving operations despite the ending of a critical 72 hour window to find survivors. Stories of miraculous recoveries have been emerging. A woman in her 90s was found alive under rubble five days in Suzu. Those in the worst-affected areas are being urged to keep their guard up as they continue to experience further quakes.

This marks the first Golden Globe win for a non-English animated feature. Billed as Mr Miyazaki's final feature, it was up against Disney productions such as Wish and Elemental in the animated feature category. The film centres on a young boy who meets a mysterious speaking heron after losing his mother during World War Two. It echoes parts of Mr Miyazaki's life story. Like the boy, his own family was evacuated to the countryside during the war. Mr Miyazaki also had a deep bond with his own mother, who was said to have had a large influence on his work and the strong female characters in his films. The Golden Globes have traditionally been seen as a bellwether for the Oscars. Mr Miyazaki's 2001 feature, Spirited Away, won an Oscar in the animated feature category. Mr Miyazaki came out of retirement to make The Boy and the Heron, and spent seven years on the production. He directed and wrote the original screenplay for the film. The film was reportedly the first original anime film to top the North American box office after it was released there in December. It first premiered in Japan in June and has been a box office hit in many countries, grossing more than $136m (£107m) worldwide. Producer Toshio Suzuki said last year that it was one of the most expensive Japanese films ever made. While the filmmakers were not present in Los Angeles to accept the award, Mr Suzuki said on Monday: ""This is the first Golden Globe awarded to a Studio Ghibli film and it is a very special feeling."" Alongside Mr Miyazaki, he is one of several co-founders of Studio Ghibli. ""Since the beginning of this year, Japan has been hit by a series of tragic earthquakes and accidents... In such a situation, I hope the bright news of winning an award can bring a smile to everyone's face, even if only a little,"" he added.","['Golden Globes', 'Film', 'Animation', 'Japan', 'Asia']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1A06/production/_132226660_aff2dca5dd97775824f8281b1eff8cf1e4bcf82a0_0_4592_34241000x746.jpg'],['Kelly Ng'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59900139,China and Taiwan: A really simple guide,China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island.,2024-01-09,"China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. Taiwan has strong links to China, its biggest trading partner. And many Taiwanese have business and family connections across the strait. But over time, polls show that the number of people who identify as Taiwanese, as opposed to Chinese, has gone up. The island, which is roughly 100 miles from the coast of south-east China, has been home to various indigenous tribes for centuries. Historical sources suggest it first came under the full control of a Chinese empire in the 17th Century. It became a Japanese colony in 1895, after the Qing empire lost the first Sino-Japanese war. Then in 1945, after Japan lost World War Two, China took the island but now a nationalist government, led by General Chiang Kai-shek, was in power. This was at the height of a decades-long conflict between Chiang's forces and Mao Zedong's Communist Party. When the communists won in 1949, Chiang and what was left of the nationalist party, known as the Kuomintang or KMT, fled to Taiwan, where they ruled for several decades. They called this the Republic of China, a name Taiwan has retained. The Chinese Communist Party points to this history to claim Taiwan. But the Taiwanese point to the same history to argue that they were not part of the modern Chinese state that was first formed after the revolution in 1911 - or the People's Republic of China that was established under Mao in 1949. Today, only 12 countries (plus the Vatican) officially recognise Taiwan. The US decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Beijing to Taipei in 1979 was the turning point. And a richer, more powerful China exerts pressure so more countries do not recognise Taiwan or lend it support. But America remains the island's strongest ally, sells arms to it and has vowed to help in case of a Chinese attack. China has spoken of ""peaceful reunification"" - a long-term goal to win over the island's population through soft power and CCP-sponsored messaging that shows unification in a positive light. But Beijing has also used threats. President Xi Jinping has said ""reunification"" with the island must be fulfilled and is believed to have a deadline. In a military confrontation, China's armed forces would dwarf those of Taiwan. China is the second-biggest spender on defence after the US and could draw on a huge range of capabilities, from naval power to missile technology, aircraft and cyber attacks. Some Western experts predict that Taiwan could at best aim to slow a Chinese attack, try to prevent a shore landing by amphibious forces, and mount guerrilla strikes while waiting for outside help. And that help could come from the US. But for decades Washington has walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Taipei - and has been deliberately unclear about whether or how it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack. US-China ties have, however, soured in recent years. And Beijing often accuses the US of reneging on its ""One-China"" policy, which recognises only one Chinese government, in Beijing. But Washington denies this, saying the status quo has not changed. Taiwan sits in the so-called ""first island chain"", which includes a list of US-friendly territories that are crucial to Washington's foreign policy in the region. China's increasingly aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea has also made Taiwan more significant to US calculations. Taiwan's economy is another factor. Much of the world's electronics - from phones to electric cars - are powered by computer chips made in Taiwan. By one measure, a single Taiwanese company - the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC - has over half of the world's market. So if China takes the island, it could be freer to project power in the western Pacific and rival the US. Beijing would also have control over an industry that drive the global economy. But China insists that its intentions are peaceful - and accuses the US of encircling it with military bases that stretch from Australia in the south to Japan in the north.

The reptiles had an estimated market value of A$1.2m (£633,000: $805,000), according to New South Wales Police. Three men and a woman have been arrested in Sydney. Some 257 lizards and three snakes were seized by police after allegedly being kept in poor conditions. They have been treated and returned to the wild. Police set up a taskforce to investigate the alleged smugglers in September after 59 live lizards were intercepted in nine small containers on their way to Hong Kong. Officers have conducted a series of raids in New South Wales in the past few weeks. At one home in Sydney they seized 118 lizards, three snakes, eight eggs and 25 dead lizards. A search of a property in rural Grenfell turned up four lizards hidden in bags. The four suspects - all aged between 31 and 59 - have been charged with offences including exporting native reptiles, dealing with the proceeds of crime and participating in a criminal group, If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison. Two of the men were refused bail after appearing in court over the weekend. In recent decades, Hong Kong has grown to dominate the international trade in a range of exotic animals, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

The announcement comes as Taiwan prepares to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 13 January. US weapons sales to Taiwan are a frequent source of tension between Beijing and Washington. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, a claim Taiwan's government rejects. Last month, the US State Department approved a $300m (£236m) sale of equipment to help maintain Taiwan's tactical information systems. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that the sanctions were ""In response to these gravely wrong actions taken by the US"". It also said the recent arms sales ""seriously harm China's sovereignty and security interests, undermine the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"". The companies being sanctioned were named as BAE Systems Land and Armament, Alliant Techsystems Operation, AeroVironment, ViaSat and Data Link Solutions. China will freeze the assets of the companies and ban people and organisations in China from engaging them, the Foreign Ministry said. The BBC has contacted the US embassy in Beijing for comment. Beijing has ramped up its pressure on Taiwan ahead of the elections that could redefine the island's relationship with China. In his annual New Year's Eve address, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his claim that Taiwan would ""surely be reunified"" with China. He also struck a stronger tone than last year's message, when he spoke about Taiwan being part of the ""same family"".

It is a longstanding policy of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to hold a referendum on becoming a republic. But a minister has told local media that such a vote is ""not a priority"" and there is ""no timeline"" for it. The government last week said it was expecting a visit from the king ""later this year"". The prime minister enjoyed a ""warm relationship"" with Charles, a government spokesperson said in a statement to The Australian. Buckingham Palace is yet to confirm the trip. The comments follow last year's defeat for the government in a separate referendum, in which Australians overwhelmingly rejected a plan to give greater political rights to Indigenous people. All six states voted against a proposal to amend the constitution to recognise First Nations people. Proponents said this would have ushered in a new era, but opponents called it divisive. Asked over the weekend about the government's plans for another referendum - on becoming a republic - a government minister told The Australian the issue was currently ""not a priority"". Pressed further on the topic on ABC on Monday, Assistant Minister for the Republic Matt Thistlethwaite said there was ""no timeline"". He instead highlighted the need to tackle cost-of-living issues. Like people in other nations, Australians have been suffering the effects of high inflation and rising interest rates. But Mr Thistlethwaite said he was ""not giving up"", and it was still the plan of the governing Labor Party for Australia to break away from the UK Royal Family ""longer term"". The country voted against cutting ties with the monarchy in a referendum in 1999. Calls have continued in the quarter-century since for another ballot. Mr Albanese has previously said an Australian republic is ""inevitable"" and appointed Mr Thistlethwaite as the country's first-ever minister dedicated to such a mission. Australian actor Hugh Jackman told the BBC last year that he, too, believed a break with the UK's Royal Family would be a natural part of his country's ""evolution"". But the X-Men star added that he held ""no ill-will"" towards King Charles and wished the family ""all the best"". New Zealand's former PM and current leader of the opposition, Chris Hipkins, has said he is also a republican who believes his own country will ""ideally"" leave the monarchy one day. Barbados became the world's newest republic in 2021, after removing Elizabeth II as its head of state - though it opted to remain in the Commonwealth. In a speech during the official ceremony, Charles - then the Prince of Wales - acknowledged the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"" the Caribbean island suffered during British colonial rule.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67922062,Gabriel Attal: Macron's pick for PM is France's youngest at 34,"Gabriel Attal has been named France's next prime minister, as Emmanuel Macron aims to revive his presidency with a new government.",2024-01-09,"Gabriel Attal has been named France's next prime minister, as Emmanuel Macron aims to revive his presidency with a new government. At 34, he is the youngest PM in modern French history, outranking even Socialist Laurent Fabius who was 37 when he was appointed by François Mitterrand in 1984. Mr Attal replaces Élisabeth Borne, who resigned after 20 months in office. Throughout that time she struggled with a lack of a majority in parliament. Gabriel Attal, who is currently education minister, certainly makes an eye-catching appointment. He will now have the task of leading the French government into important European Parliament elections in June. His rise has been rapid. Ten years ago he was an obscure adviser in the health ministry, and a card-carrying member of the Socialists. He will also be the first openly gay occupant of Hôtel Matignon. He has a civil partnership with another Macron whizz-kid, the MEP Stéphane Sejourné. Welcoming him to his new role, President Macron wrote on social media: ""I know I can count on your energy and your commitment to implement the project of revitalisation and regeneration that I announced."" ""France will never rhyme with decline, France rhymes with transformation, France rhymes with audacity,"" Mr Attal declared outside his new residence. But given the difficulties of the president's second term - and the growing challenge from the nationalist right - is ""eye-catching"" alone going to cut it? Handsome, youthful, charming, popular, cogent, Mr Attal certainly comes to office trailing clouds of glory - much, let it be said, like his mentor and role-model the president himself. But like many go-getters of his generation, he was inspired by Emmanuel Macron's idea of breaking apart the old left-right divide and re-writing the codes of French politics. In the wake of Macron's 2017 election, Mr Attal became a member of parliament, and it was there that his brilliance as a debater - easily the best of the neophyte Macronite intake - brought him to the president's attention. At 29, he became the youngest ever minister in the Fifth Republic with a junior post at education: from 2020 he was government spokesman and his face began to register with the voters: after President Macron's re-election, he was briefly budget minister and then took over at education last July. It was in this post that Mr Attal confirmed to the president that he has what it takes, acting with no-nonsense determination to end September's row over Muslim abaya robes by simply banning them in schools. He led a campaign against bullying - he himself was a victim, he says - at the elite École alsacienne in Paris, and took on the education establishment with his proposal to experiment with school uniform. And, all the while, he managed to buck the normal trends by actually becoming popular among the public. Polls show that he is by far the most admired member of the Macron government - competing at the same level as the president's main enemy, the nationalist Marine Le Pen and her youthful colleague Jordan Bardella. And there, of course, is the heart of it. By drawing Gabriel Attal from his pack of ministers, Mr Macron is using an ace to outplay the queen and her jack. But will it work? The drawn-out process of naming him - everyone knew a reshuffle was coming but it took forever - shows that if President Macron is well aware of the weakness of his current position, he has also been in deep uncertainty over how to address it. More than one commentator has made the obvious point that what the public wants above all now is not so much a rearrangement of faces at the top, but a new sense of purpose to the Macron presidency. But as things stand, Mr Attal will face exactly the same problems as did his long-suffering predecessor Élisabeth Borne. These are: a hard-right opposition that is surging in popularity and looks set to win easily in June's European elections: a National Assembly with no in-built majority for the government, making every new law a struggle: and a president who seems unable to define what he wants his second term to achieve. On top of which, the new prime minister will have a problem all of his own - which is establishing his authority over such heavyweights as Gérald Darmanin and Bruno Le Maire. And what is the plan, some are also asking, if as seems likely Mr Macron's party loses heavily in the European elections? Normally that would be the occasion for a prime ministerial replacement, to give a new élan for the second half of the mandate. But, as things stand, that card has already been played, and in the event of a defeat in June Gabriel Attal risks drifting on as a discredited loser. Even opposition figures recognise that he is a class act. He is respected and liked in the National Assembly. But there are also questions about what he actually stands for. The suspicion for many is that he is all smiles and verbiage, much like the man to whom he owes his career. As the president's nominee, he is the wunderkind's wunderkind. But if he is only Macron's mini-me, the marvel could prove a mirage.","['France', 'Emmanuel Macron']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1701C/production/_132263249_0f5902b142b7e2d48636e503a4d8076fc00467750_33_3306_18601000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C46D/production/_132258205_gettyimages-1637302580.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7EE5/production/_132258423_gettyimages-1081774406.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2C15/production/_132258211_778fe1c4f7ac666f3887a505b49fb5719aacfaff0_25_2903_16341000x563.jpg']",['Hugh Schofield'],World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67929549,Polish police arrest MPs in presidential palace,Polish police have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw in a day of unprecedented political theatre.,2024-01-09,"Polish police have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw in a day of unprecedented political theatre. Mariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wasik were sentenced to two years' jail last month for abuse of power when they led an anti-corruption office in 2007. Following the arrests, the new interior minister Marcin Kierwinski wrote on X: ""Everyone is equal before the law."" The arrests highlight the political turmoil between the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the new pro-EU coalition. The men, who were elected PiS MPs in October, refused to recognise last month's court decision because President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, pardoned them for the crime in 2015. Mr Duda has also said he does not recognise the court's ruling because he insists his pardon remains valid. The pair have been stripped of their parliamentary mandates, but both they and President Duda insist they remain legally elected MPs because of the pardon. On Monday evening, the court issued a warrant to police to detain the men. Despite this, Mr Duda invited both to Warsaw's Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning to attend a ceremony to swear in two of their former colleagues as presidential advisers. Several hours later, they emerged from the palace to speak briefly to reporters, all the while remaining inside its grounds. Mr Kaminski said they will be ""political prisoners"" if they are arrested and thanked Mr Duda for his support. ""We are dealing with a very serious state crisis. A grim dictatorship is being created,"" Mr Kaminski said. They then returned inside the palace as the political theatre unfolded. Moments later, Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference the situation was ""unbelievable"". He said the court's ruling must be respected and suggested President Duda was helping the men evade justice. ""There is no rulebook for the prime minister or interior minister on how to act when convicts are in the Presidential Palace. This is clearly taking advantage of a situation in which no one will use force against such an institution as the president,"" he added. Following the arrests, several hundred PiS supporters demonstrated outside the palace in support of the men. Last year, the Polish Supreme Court ruled Mr Duda's 2015 pardon was invalid because it was issued while the men were appealing against their conviction, ie before the original conviction was final. Mr Duda disputes that and insists the pardon is still binding. To complicate matters, the Constitutional Tribunal and a new Supreme Court chamber, both of which are staffed by judges nominated by PiS, have ruled in favour of Mr Duda. Mr Tusk said Mr Duda could resolve the stand-off by pardoning the men again, now that the ruling is final. But that would call into question the legal status of the initial pardon. Mr Tusk's coalition took office last month pledging to undo PiS's changes to the judiciary, public media, and civil service that the European Commission and many other international bodies say have undermined the rule of law in Poland. One of its first acts was to reform the state TV, radio and news agency that PiS had transformed into a propaganda mouthpiece for its government. But its methods were similar to PiS's, first using a government minister to sack media boards and install new people ahead of planned legislative reform. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights acknowledged PiS had made it legally difficult to reform the public media, which it said required ""urgent reform"" because it had become ""a propaganda mouthpiece"" under PiS, but said the new government's changes ""raise serious doubts"". Former PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC Mr Tusk's government talked loudly about democratic standards but fell well short in practice. ""We are witnessing an unprecedented attack on the rule of law. Tusk's government decided it could take over public television and media by force. This has nothing to do with democratic standards. We have not seen such brutal government action since communism. It is all the more outrageous that this is done by people who have such slogans of democracy on their lips,"" Mr Morawiecki said. Given PiS's record of controlling state institutions while in office, many Tusk supporters argue such accusations are the height of hypocrisy.","['Poland', 'Donald Tusk', 'Andrzej Duda']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2932/production/_132264501_0b81fcc6c78ed9d3f7fbf2cd5a0cf5aad57cb3d4.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/38D2/production/_132264541_a5e45657503cb0e8410607c7227b38f679cb974c.jpg']",['Adam Easton'],World,Europe

More than 1,000 sacks of pellets, known as nurdles, are believed to have fallen from the Toconao, operated by Danish company Maersk, on 8 December. Hundreds of volunteers have been working to clean up the spill in the north-west Galicia region. The alarm has also been raised on the Asturias coast, further east. As many as six containers are believed to have fallen from the Liberian-flagged Toconao some 80km (50 miles) west of Viana do Castelo in northern Portugal. Of these, one contained at least 26,000kg of pellets, while the others were carrying goods such as clingfilm, tyres and tomato sauce. Dozens of coastal communities have seen a ""white tide"" of pellets gradually washing up ashore since 13 December. The worst-affected areas are around the Galician port town of Noia and fishermen further south in Vigo have been looking out for sacks of pellets floating in the Atlantic, although recent heavy seas have made that task harder. Public prosecutors have opened an investigation and there are fears that the spill could soon spread further east along the northern coast towards the Basque country. In a statement, Maersk spokesman Rainer Horn said the shipping company regretted the incident and would investigate. The tiny plastic balls - used to manufacture common goods such as plastic bottles - are less than 5mm wide, making cleaning up extremely difficult. Volunteers have been combing through sand and sieving water to find the plastic pellets. The regional government in Galicia has accused Spain's Socialist-led national government of failing to inform local authorities for two weeks and of not activating a marine pollution plan. The national government insists it kept coastal authorities informed. The developing plastics crisis is reminiscent for local communities of Spain's worst ever environmental disaster in 2002, when the oil tanker Prestige broke up off just off the Galician coast, spilling more than 60,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil along the region's shoreline. Authorities say the pellets, which are made of PET plastic, are non-toxic. Still, there are fears the sheer scale of pollution may endanger wildlife, the environment and pose a risk to the fishing industry in the area. The Ecologists in Action group has said it will file a complaint against the Danish shipping company. The nurdles can be ingested by animals and then contribute to plastic pollution in the food chain, including for humans. PET is non-biodegradable and any pellets that are not cleaned up will remain in the environment for centuries. Around 300 million tons of nurdles are manufactured every year. Some 230,000 tonnes are believed to end up in the oceans. In 2017, an estimated 2.25 billion nurdles spilled from a ship moored in Durban, South Africa. Three years later, 10 tonnes of pellets fell into the sea off the coast of Germany when a container on the MV Trans Carrier was damaged in a storm. Nurdles from the South African spill ended up as far afield as Western Australia, 8,000km away.","['Spain', 'Pollution']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A5F5/production/_132258424_plasticspill-index-reuters.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15437/production/_132259078_86499f0667633b228c3e462345750e6441a3c9bb.jpg']",['Ido Vock'],World,Europe

Their gondola plummeted approximately 10-12m (33-39ft) after a tree fell on a support cable on Tuesday morning.

Police said nothing appeared to be technically at fault with the cable car route, called the Acherkogelbahn, and there was no evidence of any human error.

Two German citizens in another gondola were also injured because of the vibration of the cable but their condition was unknown. What is unclear is how a tree could have fallen on to the support cable.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67922431,Italian fascist salute images spark political uproar,Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is being urged to ban neo-fascist groups after hundreds of men were seen giving fascist salutes during a rally in Rome on Sunday night.,2024-01-09,"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is being urged to ban neo-fascist groups after hundreds of men were seen giving fascist salutes during a rally in Rome on Sunday night. They were taking part in an annual commemoration for three far-right activists who were killed in the 1970s, allegedly by far-left militants. But a video shared on social media has thrust the event into the spotlight. In it, rows of black-clad men can be seen extending their right arms. They are also heard shouting ""Present!"", in response to the rallying cry ""For all fallen comrades!"" - a slogan typical of the Italian far-right. The rally is held every year to commemorate the 1978 killings of three teenage activists from the youth wing of the far-right Italian Social Movement (MSI). Two were shot dead by suspected far-left militants outside MSI headquarters on Via Acca Larentia in Rome, while the third was killed by police in riots that followed the shooting. No-one was ever prosecuted for the killings, which have become widely known as the ""Acca Larentia massacre"". Sunday night's scenes have been condemned by parties across the political spectrum. Elly Schlein, the leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), said the images from the rally ""look like 1924"", referring to the era of fascist leader Benito Mussolini and his black-shirted militias. ""What happened is unacceptable. Neo-fascist groups must be disbanded, as the constitution spells out,"" Ms Schlein added. The leader of the centrist Azione party, Carlo Calenda, said that the Acca Larentia commemoration was an ""unacceptable disgrace in a European democracy."" Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani, the leader of centre-right party Forza Italia, said that any celebration of dictatorship should be condemned and added that ""there is a law stating that you cannot make an apology for fascism in our country"". Even some members of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party - which has its political roots in the MSI - have criticised the scenes. Giovanni Donzelli said that FdI had ""nothing to do with what has happened"" and that those taking part in the event were ""200 idiots that the left will use to judge us"". However, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is also the leader of FdI, has so far stayed silent on the matter. Ms Meloni has commemorated the 1978 killings in the past. In 2021, she posted a Facebook tribute to the three slain activists, saying that the killings were ""a tragedy where no culprit has ever been found"" and calling them ""a wound that has never healed"". Her equivocation stems from her own political background. Aged 19, Ms Meloni told journalists that she considered Italy's wartime fascist leader Benito Mussolini ""a good politician"". She entered Italian politics as a member of the MSI. In recent years, she has tried to reposition herself as more moderate, rejecting the label ""far-right"" and declaring that her party had ""consigned fascism to history."" But critics point to the fact that the party logo still has the tricolour flame - long a symbol of neo-fascism - and will see in her silence on the scenes from Acca Larentia a nod to the more extremist side of her support base. The images from the Acca Larentia commemoration went viral after they were shared by La Repubblica correspondent Paolo Berizzi, but events of this kind are not unusual in Italy. Every year, hundreds of Mussolini supporters gather in his hometown of Predappio and hold commemorative rallies that feature fascist-era slogans and gestures. Such events spark controversy on a regular basis, with opposition parties calling for police to investigate. However, unlike Germany, where the use of right-wing extremist symbols is banned, Italy does not have a law that prohibits the use fascist imagery or gestures. There are buildings and monuments across Italy bearing Mussolini's name. Laws do exist ""against apology for fascism"" but they are vague and rarely enforced. In 2017, an attempt at passing tighter legislation failed after right-wing parties argued the proposed bill would threaten freedom of speech. On Tuesday, Ignazio La Russa - a key ally of Ms Meloni who, as senate speaker, holds Italy's second-highest office of state - weighed into the debate, stating that making fascist salutes was ""not always a crime"". Mr La Russa, who is a known collector of fascist memorabilia and has busts of Mussolini in his home, told Italian media that there was still uncertainty over how ""certain gestures"" are considered if they were made in the context of a commemoration of the dead. He added that he was looking forward to an upcoming verdict by the Court of Cassation, which is set to determine whether making the fascist salute constitutes a crime.","['Rome', 'Giorgia Meloni', 'Italy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E8A/production/_132260102_b223bd36-ed56-4707-9bed-db53494e72cb.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/BCC6/production/_132262384_gettyimages-1659571192-1.jpg']","['Laura Gozzi', 'Rome correspondent']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67914273,Sahra Wagenknecht: German politician launches 'left-wing conservative' party,German politician Sahra Wagenknecht has launched a party which she says will appeal to culturally conservative and economically left-wing voters.,2024-01-09,"German politician Sahra Wagenknecht has launched a party which she says will appeal to culturally conservative and economically left-wing voters. The BSW supports a higher minimum wage as well as an end to net-zero policies and weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Mrs Wagenknecht is one of the best-known figures in German politics and the launch represents a significant change to the political landscape. The 54-year-old said people were losing faith in mainstream parties. She was born in communist East Germany, to a German mother and Iranian father, and joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) in 1989, a few months before the fall of the Berlin Wall. After German reunification, she joined the successor party to the SED, which eventually merged into the left-wing Die Linke. Elected first to the European Parliament and then the Bundestag, the German parliament, she grew increasingly strident in her criticism of immigration, particularly after 2015, when about a million people from Syria and other countries arrived in Germany. ""She established a strong reputation and credibility for her anti-immigration positions and cultural conservatism,"" says Sarah Wagner, a lecturer at Queen's University Belfast. Mrs Wagenknecht's high profile helped her develop personal support, particularly in eastern Germany. In October, she quit Die Linke, saying: ""the way things are going… our country will be unrecognisable in 10 years."" Political scientist Cas Mudde says electoral research shows that there is a ""significant"" electorate with left-wing conservative views. But he adds that ""most of these voters care more about their right-wing cultural views than their left-wing economic views"". The pitch from the BSW - or Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht - will be tested first in the European elections in July. However, three state elections in eastern Germany in September are likely to provide a stronger indication of how the new party will fare. Ms Wagner told the BBC that the emergence of the BSW could tempt voters away from the AfD, jeopardising the far-right party's hopes of coming first in a state election for the first time. ""The AfD is going to be in quite a bit of trouble if this project is successful,"" Ms Wagner says. The far-right party has been hitting record highs in the polls, consistently scoring above some mainstream parties. The BSW has some €1.4m ($1.5m: £1.2m) funding available at launch, according to its treasurer. Parties strongly associated with individuals have a poor record in German politics. In 2000, Ronald Schill, a judge, set up an insurgent party, which garnered significant support in Hamburg before collapsing a few years later. But at least for the foreseeable future, politics in the EU's largest economy looks to be even further fractured, with voters having the choice between an unprecedented eight major parties.",['Germany'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3BC7/production/_132230351_a7e97cb3da95f9b900e4e7993c0a150fce77007f.jpg'],['Ido Vock'],World,Europe

Mr Tate is being investigated in the country over allegations of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. On Monday, Bucharest's Court of Appeal ordered a new trial over the held assets, which includes luxury cars. Mr Tate's brother Tristan and two associated companies were also parties to the successful appeal. The brothers appealed a December 2023 court ruling which upheld the legality of the seizure of their assets. A ruling handed down by a higher court on Monday said it overturned the earlier ruling and referred it for a retrial. The decision means the Tate brothers will be able to return to court and mount a new legal effort to reclaim their seized assets. Two companies, SC Ground Breaking Development SRL and The Cannon Run Limited, were listed alongside the Tate brothers as parties in the appeal. In a post on his official Twitter account, Andrew Tate said a court will now have to demonstrate the wealth was acquired illegally in order to justify the ongoing seizure, adding: ""They won't prove a thing because it never happened."" Court documents released in June indicated the brothers had amassed millions of euros and acquired expensive assets and properties via their business activities, which included adult content and online self-help courses. Both Tate brothers deny charges levelled by Romanian investigators that they exploited women via their adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Two female Romanian associates were also named alongside the British-American brothers in an indictment published in June, and seven alleged victims were identified. The brothers were first arrested in December 2022 and spent time in prison before being place under house arrest. While they are no long under detention, the brothers are prohibited from leaving Romania while the investigation progresses. In January 2023, expensive cars were seen being removed from a property associated with the Tates near Bucharest. Watches worth millions of euros were also confiscated during the raids.","['Romania', 'Andrew Tate']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13940/production/_132129108_3f89c252109fafb943fa37ac3927b27ba82e0e75.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0509/production/_128298210_annotation2023-01-14143816.jpg']",['Sean Seddon'],World,Europe

There are also reported blockages in Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Bavaria. The subsidy cuts were designed to fix a budget crisis after a court ruled the government's 2024 budget was illegal. But the cuts have backfired and there are fears the ensuing row could feed the far right's popularity. Reacting to the blockades, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned that stopping people from going to work, school or to see a doctor ""will cause anger and disagreement."" But farmers are enraged and their association, DBV, has called on the government to scrap all plans for cutting farmer's subsidies. ""Otherwise the supply of high quality food stuffs is jeopardised,"" warned DBV head Joachim Rukwied in a radio interview. Ministers have been scrambling to plug a financial blackhole of tens of billions of euros after a bombshell ruling in November by Germany's constitutional court, which declared the government's budget illegal. However subsequent proposals to end farmers' tax breaks on agricultural diesel have already been watered down, with the change now set to be phased in over time. The government also dropped plans to abolish preferential treatment in vehicle tax. But it hasn't assuaged farmers' anger and, in heated scenes, a group of protesters even prevented the Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck from disembarking from a ferry last week. The demonstration drew widespread condemnation and sparked fresh fears about the radicalisation of political debate in Germany. But the co-leader of the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Alice Weidel, said that the episode showed that the vice chancellor was ""no longer taken seriously"". ""And instead of seeking dialogue, he'd rather flee on a ferry,"" she wrote. The AfD has been hitting record highs in the polls, consistently scoring above the three governing parties. There are frequent reports of infighting and barely-disguised tensions within Germany's ruling traffic light coalition of Social Democrats, the Greens and Free Democrats. Crucial regional elections later this year will test at least part of the country's mood with three eastern states - Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia - going to the polls. Planned train drivers strikes will also pile further pressure on the coalition later this week. Germany's GDL union said on Sunday that it would call on members to walk out from Wednesday as part of a wage dispute with rail operator Deutsche Bahn. As the tractors pull up in central Berlin, it is an inauspicious start to the year for Chancellor Scholz's government and comes alongside predictions of lacklustre economic growth for a country often described as the EU's ""powerhouse"".","['Germany', 'Alternative for Germany (AfD)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED0A/production/_132228606_gettyimages-1916691000.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9594/production/_132229283_45bd9f3440334c03b938f201961368effd58d4e50_0_5114_33881000x662.jpg']","['Jessica Parker', 'Berlin correspondent']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67914614,Anders Breivik: Mass murderer sues Norway over prison isolation,A neo-Nazi who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011 is suing the country in a bid to end his years in isolation.,2024-01-09,"A neo-Nazi who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011 is suing the country in a bid to end his years in isolation. Anders Breivik, who killed eight people with a car bomb in Oslo and shot dead 69 people at a summer youth camp, says his conditions breach his human rights. Norway's justice ministry says he must be kept separate from the prison population over security concerns. Breivik's lawyers told a court on Monday the 44-year-old no longer wishes to live. ""He has been isolated for about 12 years... He lives in a completely locked world,"" his lawyer, Oeystein Storrvik, told a court hearing on Monday. ""He does not wish to be alive anymore,"" he added. Breivik is also asking the court to lift restrictions on his correspondence with the outside world. Breivik was sentenced to 21 years - the maximum penalty a court in Norway can impose, though it can be extended for as long as he is deemed a threat - for carrying out the attacks on 22 July 2011. He has challenged the terms of his sentence before, winning part of his human rights case against the Norwegian state in 2016 before it was overturned the following year. The 44-year-old currently spends his time in a dedicated section of Ringerike prison - located on the shores of the lake that surrounds the island of Utoeya, where he shot dead 69 people. Many of those killed on Utoeya were teenagers involved with the Norwegian Labour Party's youth wing, the AUF. The attacks remain Norway's worst peacetime atrocity. At the prison, Breivik has access to a training room, kitchen, TV room and a bathroom, which pictures from a visit last month by Norwegian news agency NTB showed. Lawyers for the justice ministry argue Breivik enjoys ""a wide range of activities"" such as cooking, games, walks, basketball and studies. They also say his isolation is ""relative"" as he has contact with guards, a priest, health professionals and, until recently, a volunteer who Breivik no longer wishes to see. He also sees two inmates for an hour every other week, the lawyers said. ""An extraordinarily dangerous inmate requires extraordinary measures,"" Andreas Hjetland told the court on Monday. ""He is still proud of what he has done. He still holds the same ideological views,"" Hjetland said. The judge will deliver a verdict in the coming weeks. There is no jury. Ingrid Kragh Swang, whose eldest son survived the attack on Utoeya, told Norweigan broadcaster NRK she was ""sick and tired of this being brought up again and again"". ""It wears us down and tears something up in us,"" she added. Breivik unsuccessfully applied for parole in 2022, with the court ruling he had not changed and remained a risk to society.","['Norway', 'Anders Behring Breivik']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14AFE/production/_132243748_andersbreivik.png'],['James Gregory'],World,Europe

A key player on the global stage and a country at the political heart of Europe, France paid a high price in both economic and human terms during the two world wars. The years which followed saw protracted conflicts culminating in independence for Algeria and most other French colonies in Africa, as well as decolonisation in south-east Asia. France was one of the key players in European integration as the continent sought to rebuild after the devastation of World War Two. President: Emmanuel Macron A former economy minister who had never held elected office before, Emmanuel Macron won the May 2017 presidential election run-off by a decisive margin over his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen. The former banker launched an independent campaign for the presidency little over a year before the election, and his En Marche! movement galvanised enough support from the centre-right and left to knock the traditional Socialist and Republican party candidates out in the first round of voting. The following year saw President Macron's popularity fall as he tried to overhaul the economy, with major street protests in November 2018 over his attempt to wean the public off fossil fuels through price hikes. In the April 2022 presidential election, Macron again defeated Le Pen in the second round of voting. Prime Minister: Gabriel Attal President Macron appointed Gabriel Attal as France's prime minister in January 2024, in a move aimed at reviving his presidency with a new government. Appointed at the age of 34, Attal is the youngest prime minister in modern French history. He replaced Élisabeth Borne, who resigned after 20 months in office. Throughout that time she struggled with a lack of a majority in parliament. The appointment of Attal, the former education minister, does not necessarily signal any major political shift, but signals a desire by President Macron to try and move beyond 2023's unpopular pension and immigration reforms and improve his party's chances in the EU parliamentary elections in June 2024.

Reports of an overhaul of the government have been rife in recent weeks as Mr Macron looks to boost his political fortunes ahead of June's election and in a year when France will be centre stage when it hosts the Olympic Games. With three years left of his presidency, commentators have said an overhaul is necessary to revive his government's political impetus after a series of protests over controversial policies and legislative defeats. His government  suffered a significant defeat on a key piece of immigration legislation in December, which was widely seen as a moment of crisis. The law eventually passed after concessions were made to right-wing opposition groups but Mr Macron's party is still expected to face a strong challenge in the European poll. Ms Borne's departure will be seen as the beginning of that overhaul, with several key figures in government tipped to replace her. The 34-year-old education minister Gabriel Attal is considered the frontrunner for the job. He would become France's youngest and first openly gay prime minister. Armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu - who at 37, would also be the youngest person to hold the post - and ex-agriculture minister Julien Denormandie have been tipped as potential alternatives. An announcement on a new prime minister is not expected until Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Élysée Palace told the BBC. France's prime minister is expected to manage the day-to-day business of the government and heads the Council of Ministers. Mr Macron's party lost its parliamentary majority in 2022, meaning the new prime minister will face an uphill struggle to turn the President's policies into law. When appointed, the new prime minister will become the fourth to hold office since Mr Macron was first elected as President in 2017.","['France', 'Emmanuel Macron']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1379E/production/_132247797_def0b262138695fa18402f0d077ba533b35d9c1e0_0_5352_35681000x667.jpg'],['Sean Seddon'],World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17907947,Serbia country profile,Serbia became a stand-alone sovereign republic in the summer of 2006 after Montenegro voted in a referendum for independence from the Union of Serbia and Montenegro.,2024-01-09,"Serbia became a stand-alone sovereign republic in the summer of 2006 after Montenegro voted in a referendum for independence from the Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The end of the Union marked the closing chapter in the separation of the six republics of the old Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, which was proclaimed in 1945 and comprised Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. Yugoslavia's communist leader, Josip Broz Tito, kept the lid on ethnic tensions. The federation lasted for over 10 years after his death in 1980, but under Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic it fell apart through the 1990s. The secession of Slovenia and Macedonia came relatively peacefully, but there were devastating wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia and Montenegro together formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2003 before forming a looser union. In 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence. In recent years the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has steadily eroded political rights and civil liberties, putting pressure on independent media, the political opposition, and civil society organizations, says the democracy advocacy group Freedom House. President: Aleksandar Vucic President Aleksandar Vucic claimed a re-election victory in the country's snap December 2023 elections, with his Serbian Progressive Party, or SNS, winning some 47% of the vote. Opposition parties under the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) banner were well behind with around 23%. The vote was almost immediately marred by accusations of irregularities. The International Election Observation Mission said in a statement that ""serious irregularities, including vote-buying and ballot box stuffing were observed"". The SNS has been in power since 2012 but there have been three elections  since 2020. Opposition figures accused the SNS of using public resources for political purposes and election monitor CRTA complained before the vote of a ""chronic lack of pluralism"" in Serbia. In 2021, Amnesty International characterised his mandate as one of human rights violations, restrictions on freedom of expression and campaigns of harassment against the opposition figures, journalists and media outlets. Serbia is a candidate to become a member of the European Union, and President Vucic is under pressure from both the EU and the US to normalise relations with Kosovo. Kosovo declared unilateral independence from Serbia in 2008, and while it is recognised by more than 100 UN members, Serbia has refused to do so - backed by allies like Russia, China and five EU members. Prime minister: Ana Brnabic Ana Brnabic made history as the first female and first openly gay prime minister of Serbia when she took office in June 2017. Ms Brnabic is non-party, and has a background in local government development. She has described herself as a pro-European and technocratic prime minister. Some critics have argued that it is Vukic, as president, who wields effective power in Serbia. Television is, by far, the main source of news and information. The flagship public network, RTS1, is among a handful of outlets that dominate the market. There are more than 90 TV channels and the average viewer spends more than five hours a day watching television, the highest figure in Europe. Six TV stations are licensed to broadcast nationally: 30 have regional licences. The national TV broadcasters attract around 70% of the audience. RTS1 is the most popular channel in Serbia, attracting up to a quarter of the audience and providing strong competition for commercial stations, including leading commercial network TV Pink. Some key dates in Serbia's history: 1389 - Serb nobility decimated in battle of Kosovo Polje as Ottoman Empire expands. 15th - 18th Centuries - Serbia absorbed by Ottoman Empire. 1817 - Serbia becomes autonomous principality. 1878 - Serbian independence recognised by international treaties. 1918 - Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes - later Yugoslavia - formed after World War One. 1945 - Together with Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro, Serbia becomes one of republics in new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito. 1980 - Tito dies. 1989 - Slobodan Milosevic becomes President of Serbia. 1991 - Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia break away from Yugoslavia. 1992 - Montenegro and Serbia form Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Rising nationalist and independence aspirations bring bloody conflict with Croats and Bosnian Muslims. UN imposes sanctions. 1995 - Dayton accords bring end to Bosnian war. Sanctions lifted. 1997 - Milosevic becomes Yugoslav president. 1998 - Kosovo Liberation Army rebels against Serbian rule. Serb forces launch brutal crackdown. Hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians flee. 1999 - Defiance by Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo sparks Nato air strikes against Serbian targets. Milosevic agrees to withdraw forces from Kosovo. Kosovo becomes UN protectorate but remains de jure part of Serbia. 2002 - Trial of Slobodan Milosevic on charges of genocide and war crimes begins in The Hague. 2006 - Milosevic found dead in his cell in The Hague. 2006 - Montenegro votes in a referendum to separate from Serbia and declares independence. 2008 - Kosovo unilaterally declares independence, which is gradually recognised by the US and most EU and Nato countries but not Serbia. 2008 - Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who evaded capture on war crimes charges for almost 13 years, is arrested by Serbian security forces in Belgrade and flown to The Hague to stand trial. 2011 - Serbian authorities arrest former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic. 2013 - Serbia and Kosovo sign landmark agreement on normalising relations. 2014 - EU membership talks begin. 2016 - UN tribunal finds former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic guilty of genocide and war crimes and sentences him to 40 years in prison. 2017 - Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic is jailed for life for genocide and other atrocities in the 1990s Bosnian war.","['Serbia', 'Europe']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14FB0/production/_128363958_bbcm_serbia_country_profile_map_200123.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/104D2/production/_127807766_0ea0f71f-e60c-4c19-bc5f-0c9893dc84bd.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DCB/production/_100232711_gettyimages-924390802.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12BE2/production/_127807767_87fb8907-e6b4-49ab-bcd2-9934bb3d7272.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/139C3/production/_88932308_serbia_flag.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DDC2/production/_127807765_8fc07aa3-4a4a-4814-8493-b79a7eaa0012.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13142/production/_128364187_gettyimages-1211545403-1.jpg']",['N/A'],World,Europe

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67913465,The Cuban spying case that has shocked the US government,"When the former US ambassador to Bolivia, Manuel Rocha, was arrested in Miami recently and charged by his previous employer - the US government - with having spent more than 40 years as a Cuban agent, it amounted to one of the biggest spying scandals involving the communist-run island this century.",2024-01-09,"When the former US ambassador to Bolivia, Manuel Rocha, was arrested in Miami recently and charged by his previous employer - the US government - with having spent more than 40 years as a Cuban agent, it amounted to one of the biggest spying scandals involving the communist-run island this century. The US Attorney General, Merrick Garland, called Mr Rocha's alleged crimes ""one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the US government by a foreign agent"". While Manuel Rocha is yet to enter a plea, many observers remain baffled as to how he could have risen so high in the US diplomatic service while evading detection for so long, apparently honing a reputation as a hard-nosed conservative while secretly harbouring a deep-seated allegiance to the Cuban Revolution. Evidence recorded by an undercover FBI officer, posing as a Cuban government contact, appears to show him describing the United States as the ""enemy"", praising the late Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, and boasting about having successfully maintained his dual identity for decades. One man who was not entirely surprised, though, was James Olson, the former head of counterintelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He has years of first-hand experience of Cuba's intelligence service, the General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI). ""I would rank them as probably the most aggravating intelligence service I've ever worked against,"" he says. ""That's not just because they're so devious and so ruthless, but because they're so good."" Former CIA agent Olson says the idea that Cuba allegedly ""ran"" Rocha for four decades is part of their modus operandi, especially with ideological spies as opposed to mercenary ones. ""They also ran our other major Cuban losses for many, many years,"" he explains, referring to a number of US citizens who were discovered to have spied for Cuba. ""They ran Ana Montes for 16 years, Philip Agee for 15 years, the Myers couple for 26 years."" The Rocha case, he says, is in keeping with their work. Mr Olson says there is a common misconception that the DGI became blunted after the fall of the Berlin Wall once the KGB stepped back from the island. Not so, he argues. In fact, he believes they are more sophisticated than ever. ""I consider the Cubans more disciplined and more effective pound-for-pound than the KGB ever was. The fact that the KGB - or the SVR, as it is today - maybe sponsoring them less than it had in the past, I don't think has affected their ability to carry out operations in any way."" ""They've surpassed the KGB in terms of tradecraft and motivation and resistance to penetration,"" he says. It's a point which came home to James Olson in June 1987, when a Cuban spy, Florentino Aspillaga, walked into the US Embassy in Vienna and defected. The testimony he gave to the Americans shocked US intelligence chiefs and revealed the extent and calibre of Fidel Castro's spying network. ""Aspillaga told me some very disturbing things"", recalls Mr Olson. ""He said that the Cuban DGI had successfully run 38 double agents against us. So every agent that we thought we'd recruited on the island was, in fact, being controlled by the DGI."" It still rankles the retired CIA man that, by his own admission, the Cubans got the better of him. ""They owned us. They beat us. That's one of the reasons I have this personal grudge against the Cuban intelligence service because they have been so successful in operating against us."" As a top diplomat, Manuel Rocha had access to a wealth of classified and sensitive intelligence information. The US government is now trying to establish exactly how much of it he allegedly passed to his Cuban handlers while at the State Department. For its part, Cuba has made no comment about Manuel Rocha, his arrest or the charges he is facing in Miami. Whenever spying or spycraft is mentioned, Cuba's basic position is that it has been forced to use every method at its disposal to defend the revolution from more than 60 years of successive US administrations trying to force the communist-run government from power. One of Cuba's best known former spies is Gerardo Hernández. He was the head of a ring of five Cuban intelligence officers which infiltrated anti-Castro Cuban American groups in Florida in the 1990s. He was arrested in 1998 on conspiracy to commit espionage charges and spent 16 years in prison before being released as part of a prisoner swap during the Obama-era thaw with Havana. In an exclusive interview in Havana, Gerardo Hernández alleged that the US continued to allow armed anti-Castro groups to ""operate freely"" and ""with impunity"" on US soil, leaving Cuba ""no choice but to seek that kind of [covert] information"". While insisting he had retired as an intelligence officer a long time ago, he recognised that Cuba-US espionage remains a key part of their openly hostile bilateral relationship. ""If right now there are people plotting terrorism against Cuba, most probably there are going to be Cuban patriots seeking the information we need to protect our country,"" he says. Ahead of Manuel Rocha's trial, Gerardo Hernandez, now an influential member of Cuba's Council of State, remains tight-lipped about the case saying he knows only ""what I have read in the news"". However, in the same breath, he acknowledges that ideological spies, as he himself was in the 1990s, are harder to detect and more skilled at their trade than those who are in it for the money. ""Someone that does something not out of money or profit but for his ideals is always a better professional in this area,"" he says. Unsurprisingly, his former adversary, James Olson, takes a much dimmer view of the disgraced Manuel Rocha. ""He's a traitor. He betrayed our country. I think that's contemptible, and I don't think he's going to see the light of day again.""","['United States', 'Spying', 'Cuba', 'CIA']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1545C/production/_131923178_manuelrochagettyimages-1580103371.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16413/production/_132255119_19337c3ce2de27c8b97c7fe11dce9d77c077329d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/80A7/production/_132253923_gerardohernandez2.jpg']",['Will Grant'],World,Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67922246,Fuel in Cuba to become five times more expensive,The Cuban government has announced a five-fold increase in fuel prices as it struggles with shortages and a deepening economic crisis.,2024-01-09,"The Cuban government has announced a five-fold increase in fuel prices as it struggles with shortages and a deepening economic crisis. It said that from February the price of a litre of petrol would rise from from 25 pesos ($0.20: £0.16) to 132 pesos. The government, which subsidises many goods, hopes this will help to reduce its deficit. It is the latest measure making life more difficult for cash-strapped Cubans. Finance minister Vladimir Regueiro said the cost of diesel and other types of fuel would face similar mark-ups. He also announced a 25% increase in electricity prices for major consumers in residential areas, as well has hikes in costs for natural gas. Mr Regueiro said the government would also open 29 new petrol stations which will solely accept payment in US dollars in order to raise foreign currency to purchase fuel on the international markets. ""These measures are aimed at reviving our economy,"" Mr Regueiro told state television on Monday. Cuba has been hit hard by economic turmoil, blamed on the coronavirus pandemic, the tightening of US sanctions in recent years, and structural weaknesses. Last month, economy minister Alejandro Gil said that Cuba's communist government could no longer sell fuel at subsidised prices, emphasising it was the ""cheapest in the world"". But economics professor Omar Everleny Pérez told AFP news agency that while petrol in Cuba may be cheap by global standards, when compared with salaries in the country it was ""very expensive"". He added that the new price structure would affect ""the whole of society"". In a nation where few people own vehicles, the rise in the cost of petrol pushes hopes of car ownership even further away. Cuba, which depends heavily on imports, has suffered growing shortages of food, medicine, and consumer goods for the last four years. The price hike comes on top of rampant inflation driving up prices for basic items and stagnant salaries for state workers, upping the pressure on Cubans already struggling to make ends meet. The fuel crisis has led to long queues forming at forecourts, which sometimes stretch for miles and mean that filling a vehicle with petrol can become a days-long ordeal. Public transportation has also been sorely affected. Last year, the shortages forced the government to cancel Cuba's 2023 traditional May Day parade.","['Fuel', 'Cuba']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31F1/production/_132258721_gettyimages-1252164057.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13F79/production/_132258718_gettyimages-1239422011.jpg']",['Emily Atkinson'],World,Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67921986,Ecuador prisoners take guards hostage after drug lord's escape,Ecuador's security forces are trying to re-establish order in at least six jails where riots broke out on Monday.,2024-01-09,"Ecuador's security forces are trying to re-establish order in at least six jails where riots broke out on Monday. Inmates have reportedly taken a number of prison guards hostage and have threatened to kill them if soldiers are deployed to regain control of the penitentiaries. Four police officers were also kidnapped after President Daniel Noboa declared a state of emergency. The unrest was sparked by the escape of the notorious gang boss known as Fito. Officials said Fito, whose real name is Adolfo Macías Villamar, was not in his cell on Sunday morning when police arrived to move him to a different jail within the same compound. A search of the maximum-security wing where he was being held has so far not yielded any trace of him. Government spokesman Roberto Izurieta said that Fito, who leads the powerful Los Choneros gang, had been tipped off that he was about to be moved from La Regional jail, where he lived in a spacious cell painted in jaunty colours and decorated with murals. He is thought to have absconded just hours before his planned transfer. Two prison guards have been detained on suspicion of helping Fito escape. The 44-year-old leads Los Choneros, a powerful prison gang which is thought to be behind many of the deadly riots and prison fights which have erupted in Ecuador's jails over recent years. Even though its top boss has been operating from behind bars, Los Choneros' power is not limited to Ecuadorean prisons. Gang members also engage in contract killings, extortion and drug dealing across the country. The group has also forged an alliance with Mexico's powerful Sinaloa drugs cartel, which smuggles cocaine from neighbouring Colombia through Ecuador's port cities to the US and Europe. Fito took over leadership of the gang after its previous boss, Jorge Luis Zambrano, was killed in 2020. While he had originally kept a relatively low profile, he appeared to taunt the authorities in a ""narcocorrido"", a ballad praising his criminal exploits, released in September. In the video, two singers and Fito's daughter croon about the boss's dedication to his family and those who are loyal to him, insisting that he gets ""a bad press"". The slick recording, taken in defiance of a ban on electronic devices in jail, also shows Fito in the prison courtyard relaxing with fellow inmates and petting a fighting cockerel. His escape is a blow to the government of President Noboa, who was sworn in in November after winning an election tarnished by the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio. Villavicencio had reported receiving death threats from Fito just days before he was shot dead while leaving a campaign rally in the capital Quito. Mr Noboa declared a two-month-long nationwide state of emergency on Monday as well as a nightly curfew in an attempt to curb the violence which has erupted in the aftermath of Fito's escape. A search is under way for three police officers who were seized while on duty in the city of Machala by men driving an unmarked car. Another officer was abducted in the capital, Quito. There have also been reports of a number of explosions in the city of Cuenca, with pamphlets dropped near the scene demanding ""and end to [prison] transfers"".","['Prison escapes', 'Ecuador']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FB1D/production/_132258246_f29377de-e8ab-4ee4-be50-de3e95730362.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/122F5/production/_132258447_16f99ba2e5a36bd6a416a001c351190aba354e190_0_5500_36671000x667.jpg']",['Vanessa Buschschlüter'],World,Latin America

Adolfo Macías Villamar, better known as ""Fito"", is the leader of Los Choneros, a powerful gang which is thought to have been behind some of the deadly prison riots in recent months. He was being held in the maximum security wing of a jail in Guayaquil. The emergency measures include the suspension of the right of assembly and a nightly curfew. They were announced in a decree issued by President Daniel Noboa, who took office less than two months ago as the second-youngest holder of the post in Ecuadorean history. He won the election after a campaign overshadowed by unprecedented levels of violence, including the assassination of another candidate, Fernando Villavicencio. President Noboa said the emergency would allow the military and police to take control of the country's prisons at a national level. Los Choneros control much of the compound at La Regional prison, where Fito was being held. ""These narco-terrorist groups intend to intimidate us and they think we will give in to their demands,"" the president said. But he added: ""We will not negotiate with terrorists and we will not rest until we have restored peace."" Fito is a notorious criminal suspected of having played a role in last year's killing of Villavicencio, whom he had sent death threats. Police said they had noticed his absence early on Sunday and could not find him anywhere in the prison wing. He often defies the authorities, most recently by releasing a ""narcocorrido"", a slick music video glorifying his criminal exploits, which was partly recorded inside the jail. The video shows the Mariachi Bravo duo singing along with Fito's daughter, known as Queen Michelle, and praising the ""man of honour"" they say the criminal is. ""I take my hat off to you, Fito, my dad,"" his daughter croons, claiming that ""through his veins good blood flows"". The video shows Fito caressing a fighting cockerel and freely chatting to fellow inmates. The fact that the video could be recorded behind bars suggests that the ban on electronic devices inside the jail had been breached. It is still not clear if Fito managed to leave the prison compound in the port city or if he may be hiding somewhere inside. A police commander said he could ""neither confirm nor deny"" an escape, nor could he say for how long the convict had been missing. He said hundreds of officers were searching the prison. La Regional jail is located in a large prison compound which houses a total of five penitentiaries and more than 12,000 inmates. Fito has spent much of his past 12 years behind bars there. In August, he was briefly transferred to La Roca, a smaller jail in the same compound, which is considered safer because of the lower number of inmates. It took thousands of soldiers to move him. But the convict's lawyer appealed against the decision to transfer him and won, and Fito was moved back to La Regional after just a month. Fito has escaped from the prison compound before. In 2013, he and 17 other inmates broke out of La Roca and fled in boats on the River Daule, which borders the compound. The fugitive was captured along with his brother, a fellow member of Los Choneros, four months later at their mother's home in the city of Manta. Fito has been in prison ever since. After the killing in December 2020 of Jorge Luis Zambrano, he took over the leadership of Los Choneros. The gang, which is named after its power base in the town of Chone, mainly engages in drug trafficking and extortion and has forged links with Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel.","['Prison escapes', 'Ecuador']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2E0/production/_132229754_e1df984390b4288f72f57d2e93d2c8d56f5c03e90_0_3801_21391000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12810/production/_132229757_gettyimages-1599149353.jpg']","['Vanessa Buschschlüter', 'Robert Plummer']",World,Latin America

Sheldon Morfoot, 31, from west Cumbria, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis last year. He spent £50,000 travelling to Mexico for treatments which should help halt the progress of his symptoms. He initially borrowed the money and his friends have been helping him pay it back. Mr Morfoot, from Thornhill, near Egremont, was told last August that he had developed the same condition which claimed the life of his mother in 2015. He began to research potential treatments and travelled to a clinic in Mexico for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation late last year. The procedure is designed to reset the immune system and stop it attacking the central nervous system using stem cells taken from the patient's own bone marrow. Mr Morfoot, who spent 28 days in Mexico, said the same treatment was only available under the NHS to patients who meet certain requirements. He said he wanted the treatment quickly. ""It stops the progression dead, but it won't reverse symptoms,"" he said, adding: ""The quicker you go, with no disability, the better you're going to be."" Initially Mr Morfoot borrowed the money to get to Mexico, promising friends and family he would pay them back, including by selling his house in Thornhill which will soon go on the market. But friends have also launched fundraising campaigns to help him. Last week, some of them completed the Dave Goggins challenge in Egremont, running four miles every four hours for two days, contributing at least £5,000 to a total fundraising effort which now stands at £25,000. ""I have no words for what friends have done for me,"" Mr Morfoot said. ""The amount of support I've had is ridiculous, I cannot thank them enough."" It will be a few months before Mr Morfoot, a Sellafield motor mechanic, will discover if the treatment has worked, but he remains optimistic. ""I've got that glimmer of hope, haven't I? ""I've got MS, and I'll always have MS, but if this is stopped for five years, 10 years, that's a winner in my eyes,"" he said. Follow BBC Cumbria on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Prince Khalid bin Bandar told the BBC a pact was ""close"" when the the kingdom paused US-brokered talks after Hamas's deadly attacks on Israel on 7 October. Saudi Arabia still believed in establishing ties with Israel despite the ""deplorable"" casualty figures in Gaza, he said, but it would not ""come at the cost of the Palestinian people"". The ambassador also warned that there was a ""failure of humanity"" over Gaza, with the international community not doing enough to end the fighting. He also said he would like to see the UK ""moderate it's position"" and ""treat Israel the same way it treats everyone else"". ""The blind spot towards Israel is a real problem because it provides a blind spot to peace,"" he added. Saudi Arabia is a leader of the Arab and Islamic world. It has never formally recognised Israel since its creation in 1948, and a deal normalising ties would represent a major breakthrough for the Jewish state. In late September, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler had declared in a US television interview that ""every day we get closer"" to an agreement. While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Palestinian issue was ""very important"" and that any agreement would have to ""ease the life of the Palestinians"", he did not declare that it would be dependent on advances towards the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The public position of Palestinian leaders is that they will reject outright a deal if it does not leave them with a state, but earlier that month officials had said they were privately demanding a cash boost and more control of land in the occupied West Bank in return for engaging with the US-backed Saudi-Israel process. Saudi officials reportedly asked the US to pause the three-way discussions a few days after the 7 October attacks, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage by hundreds of Hamas gunmen who infiltrated southern Israeli communities from Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 23,200 people have been killed in the territory during the military campaign that Israel subsequently launched with the aim of destroying Hamas. After meeting Crown Prince Mohammed on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters he had brought up the subject of normalisation. ""There's a clear interest here in pursuing that,"" he said. ""But it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian state."" In an interview with the BBC's Today programme on Tuesday, the Saudi ambassador in London confirmed that ""absolutely there is interest"" among his country's leaders for an agreement. ""[A deal] was close, there is no question. For us, the final end point definitely included nothing less than an independent state of Palestine. So, while we still - going forward after 7 October - believe in normalisation, it does not come at the cost of the Palestinian people,"" Prince Khalid said. He added: ""We were close to normalisation, therefore close to a Palestinian state. One doesn't come without the other. The sequencing, how it is managed, that is what was being discussed."" Asked if Saudi Arabia saw Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western countries - as part of that future Palestinian state, Prince Khalid said it ""requires a lot of thought"". ""There is always room for change if you have optimism and hope. But when there is a conflict the first thing you have to recognise is that both sides have lost,"" he added. ""The problem that we have today with the current government in Israel is there is an extreme, absolutist perspective which does not work to achieve compromise and therefore you are never going to end the conflict."" He did not elaborate, but two far-right Israeli ministers were denounced by the US after they recently called for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza. Prince Khalid also warned that there was a risk of radicalisation as a result of the war, which has not only left many thousands of civilians dead in Gaza but also caused widespread devastation and a deep humanitarian crisis. ""The unprecedented level of the violence that has been carried out by both sides - but in particular by what is meant to be a responsible state in Israel - over the past three months, I don't think I have seen anything like it in my life,"" he said. ""The numbers are deplorable, absolutely deplorable."" ""That is going to create a lack of hope amongst not just the Palestinian people, but disaffected people [across the world]. All see a failure of humanity in what is happening, because nobody has done anything to stop it. Efforts are being made, but it is not enough.""","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Palestinian territories', 'Israel', 'Saudi Arabia']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/115A3/production/_132257017_104148b5d5c3af7636f0b272f57ccf0c0477f773.jpg'],['David Gritten'],World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67929003,David Cameron worried Israel may have broken international law in Gaza,"Lord David Cameron has said he is ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza.",2024-01-09,"Lord David Cameron has said he is ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. The foreign secretary said he regularly consulted government lawyers over incidents in the war, but refused to say whether the legal advice suggested Israel had acted illegally. Lord Cameron stressed the government had not changed its support for Israel. Since the outbreak of war following Hamas' attack on 7 October, over 23,000 Palestinians have been killed. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 59,000 Palestinians have been injured. Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led a massive attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Israel is also fighting a claim from South Africa that it is committing ""genocidal"" acts in Gaza at the International Court of Justice. Lord Cameron said he did not agree with South Africa's claim. Speaking during his first grilling by MPs since joining the House of Lords, the former prime minister said: ""I don't think that is helpful, I don't agree with it, I don't think it's right"". During a tense exchange with SNP MP Brendan O'Hara, Lord Cameron said he has seen things ""deeply concerning"" during the crisis but did not directly criticise the country's actions. He called on Israel to allow in more humanitarian aid and restore water supplies to northern Gaza. But Lord Cameron repeatedly side-stepped questions on whether he had seen legal advice suggesting Israel had breached international law, telling the foreign affairs committee ""I don't want to answer that question"". He said: ""If you're asking me am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law because this particular premises has been bombed or whatever? ""Yes, of course I'm worried about that, and that's why I consult the Foreign Office lawyers when giving this advice on arms exports."" But he hinted that government lawyers had not suggested international law had been broken. He told MPs the legal advice he had seen was ""consistent with the fact we have not changed"" rules on exporting weapons to Israel. Tory MP Bob Seely put it to Lord Cameron that he had seen legal advice suggesting the Israeli government is ""vulnerable to a challenge from the Hague court and from elsewhere that in some of the things they are doing in, potentially, in relation to proportionality, there is a vulnerability."" ""It's close to that,"" Lord Cameron replied. Downing Street later said Israel needs to ""act carefully"" and avoid risking further escalation in its war with Hamas. Asked if Rishi Sunak shares Lord Cameron's concerns about whether Israel has been acting within international law, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""It is an issue we continue to keep under review and obviously we have made our views clear to the Israeli government at a number of levels on this."" The spokesman added: ""Fundamentally, though, we recognise that it is Israel that is responding to a terror attack, first and foremost."" Two British nationals are still being held hostage by Hamas as heavy bombardment and fighting continues to shake the region, Lord Cameron told the committee. Asked if he knew if the hostages are alive, Lord Cameron said: ""I just don't want to say any more. We don't have any information to share with you."" During a ceasefire in November, 105 hostages were released by Hamas. Lord Cameron's comments come as US secretary of state Antony Blinken held talks in Israel seeking to set a plan for Gaza's post-war future. Mr Blinken has called for winding down of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza to reduce regional tensions. US officials have called for the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to take over in Gaza and for negotiations to resume on the creation of a Palestinian state.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'David Cameron', 'Israel', 'Gaza']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/615E/production/_132262942_3ae644039ab338505aca7b071375c0564e552b3b.jpg'],['Sam Francis'],World,Middle East

Asghar Gheshlaghian, from Woodford Green in east London, operated an unlicensed firm from a business centre, using a sham rug company as a front, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mr Gheshlaghian, 48, was covertly recorded by the National Crime Agency. In one conversation he said ""70 to 80 percent"" of his business was illegal. The court heard he had also described throwing his phones away in water or in dustbins. For the prosecution, Michael Bisgrove told the court Mr Gheshlaghian used the Islamic ""hawala"" banking practice to take money from those seeking access to the UK and paying it on to the smugglers once they arrived. Hawala banking is legal in the UK if carried out with a licence. It transfers value without the use of a negotiable instrument for the exchange of money. For example, a US resident who wanted to send money to a person in Pakistan would give a sum to a US-based hawaladar, who would then contact his counterpart in Pakistan. The ultimate recipient in Pakistan would go to the Pakistani hawaladar and receive his money. The two hawaladars would then settle their debt with each other. Source: UK Parliament publications Mr Bisgrove said the asylum seekers arrived between November 2016 and February 2019, hidden in lorries or brought in on small boats. Mr Gheshlaghian denies five charges including running an unlicensed money transfer service, helping an asylum seeker to enter the UK, and assisting unlawful immigration. The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67929616,Israel-Gaza war: Blinken says cost of conflict on children far too high,"The cost of war on Gaza's civilians is ""far too high"", US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.",2024-01-09,"The cost of war on Gaza's civilians is ""far too high"", US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. Mr Blinken said Israel needed to remove barriers so more essential aid could be allowed into Gaza. But he said Israel faced a huge challenge in fighting an enemy in Hamas which had embedded itself within the civilian population. Mr Blinken was speaking after meeting Israeli leaders on his fourth trip to the country since the conflict began. America's top diplomat told a press conference in Tel Aviv that leaders in the region shared US concerns about the ""dire humanitarian situation"" on the ground. But he said he had heard a new and powerful message from Israel's neighbours over the last three days. They are willing not only to live with Israel but to integrate the region in a way that makes everyone secure, including Israel, Mr Blinken said. In other words, talk of diplomatic normalisation with Israel - which had appeared to be derailed by the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel - is on the table. That, he said, would require some hard decisions and hard choices - which include Israel agreeing to a ""clear pathway to the realisation of Palestinian political rights and a Palestinian state"" which he said was vital for long-term peace. Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether this was something Israel would consider. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously voiced his staunch opposition to such a state, citing security concerns. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to a cross-border assault by Hamas - designated a terrorist organisation by Israel and many western nations including the US. 1,300 people were killed in the attacks. Since then, more than 23,200 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. When asked about whether there was any evidence that Israel was de-escalating its military campaign in Gaza, Mr Blinken answered that no one in the region - including the Israelis - wanted the conflict to escalate. That may be reassuring for many worried about the conflict spreading, but he gave no indication that Israel told him it was winding down its military operations anytime soon. In recent weeks, Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based organisation designated a terrorist group by the US, has increased rocket fire into northern Israel. Yemeni Houthi rebels have also attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea - one of the world's most important trading routes. The Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran. Mr Blinken's meetings in Israel on Tuesday were not entirely without tangible results. He announced that the US and Israel agreed on a plan for the UN to conduct an ""assessment mission"" that would be the first step toward allowing Palestinians to return to the areas of northern Gaza that have been devastated by the Israeli offensive. Even here, however, Mr Blinken warned that their return would not happen ""overnight"". Too much has to be done to clear the area of unexploded ordinance and booby traps, as well as to ensure supporting infrastructure is in place. Mr Blinken also told the press conference that South African claims that Israel was committing genocide, filed at the International Court of Justice, were ""meritless"". But he said: ""The daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high."" He cited UN figures that 90% of the population continued to face severe food insecurity, adding: ""For children, the effects of long periods without sufficient food can have lifelong consequences."" ""More food, more water, more medicine, other essential goods need to get into Gaza. And then once they're in Gaza, they need to get more effectively to the people who need them.""","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Houthis', 'Hamas', 'Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Israel', 'Antony Blinken', 'Hezbollah']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AD30/production/_132263344_anthonyzurcher.png'],"['James Gregory', 'Anthony Zurcher']",World,Middle East

More than 40 million people are under severe storm threats on Tuesday, stretching from New Mexico to Maine. In Florida, more than 85,000 people are without power from heavy winds that have blown roofs off homes and knocked down power lines. Officials have warned of more damage as the storms continue into the evening. Twelve tornadoes were reported across Florida, Alabama and Georgia by Tuesday afternoon, causing significant damage and, in some areas, prompting search and rescue operations. One motorist was reported dead in Clayton County, Georgia, officials said, after a tree fell across a highway and crushed the driver's car. Schools in Florida and several other states have closed or shifted to online learning, as the National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that the state is not yet in the clear.

In New York State, Governor Kathy Hochul warned the storm could be ""life threatening"", especially as the expected rainfall would combine with the snow already blanketing the ground, bringing about potential flash-flooding. In preparation for the storm, New York City has deployed emergency responders and utility crews, and has relocated nearly 2,000 migrants over safety concerns. ""This will be an emergency, it will be serious and we're urging all New Yorkers to exercise extreme caution at this time,"" Ms Hochul said at a Monday briefing.

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67928687,Artemis: Nasa delays crewed return to the Moon's surface,US space agency astronauts won't get to walk on the Moon again until September 2026 at the earliest.,2024-01-09,"US space agency astronauts won't get to walk on the Moon again until September 2026 at the earliest. It represents a slip of a year in the previously targeted date for the return of humans to the lunar surface that was last achieved in 1972. Nasa says the delay to what's known as its Artemis III mission will enable further technology development. Fundamentally, the agency still doesn't have a craft to put astronauts on the Moon or spacesuits they can wear. Announcing the delay, agency administrator Bill Nelson said safety drove all timing considerations. ""We won't fly until we're ready,"" he told reporters. Nasa is also pushing back to September 2025 the precursor mission known as Artemis II. This will see four astronauts fly around the Moon without actually landing. Until today, this flight was in the calendar for the end of this year. A crew comprising Jeremy Hansen, Christina Koch, Victor Glover and Reid Wiseman are already in training. Artemis I occurred in November 2022. This was an uncrewed demonstration of the SLS rocket and Orion capsule that Nasa will use to get astronauts to lunar orbit. But the capsule now requires the installation of a life-support system before the Artemis II quartet can climb aboard and the space agency says there are concerns about the electronics in this system that will now have to be revised. Engineers also want more time to understand the behaviour and performance of the heatshield that protects the Orion capsule during the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere at the end of a mission. This shield experienced some unexpected losses of material during the Artemis I return. But Nasa's biggest issue going forwards is probably the landing craft for Artemis III. This will be supplied by entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company and it will be a version of the huge new Starship vehicle currently being tested in Texas. The idea is for astronauts to transfer to Starship in lunar orbit and then go down in it to the Moon's surface. SpaceX needs not only to get the new vehicle working properly but also to stage an uncrewed demonstration at the Moon. And just getting Starship to the vicinity of the Moon will require the company to refuel its craft in Earth orbit first - a practice that's completely novel. Indeed, it could take 10 launches, or more, of other Starships just to get enough fuel into one vehicle above the Earth so it can make the journey to the Moon and then perform a landing. Nasa associate administrator Jim Free was asked if it was realistic to think all this technology could be perfected by September 2026. He responded: ""We're setting a date for [Artemis III] that we have set with our contractors, based on the technical plans that they've laid out."" Dates not slipping currently are those for the Artemis IV and V missions, which are set to take place in 2028 and 2029 respectively. IV will see the first astronaut flight to the new Gateway lunar space station that will be constructed this decade. V will see the introduction of a second landing system called Blue Moon. This is being developed by the space company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.","['Artemis', 'Astronauts', 'Nasa', 'The Moon']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15C99/production/_127814298_52529813962_9426fc5e1a_k.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1820A/production/_132262889_msfc-202301279jpeglarge.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/129A5/production/_129379167_moon.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10873/production/_128999676_fullspacesuit.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/133EA/production/_132262887_gateway_with_orion.jpg']",['N/A'],World,US & Canada

The infection led to Mr Austin being admitted to the hospital on 1 January and then to the intensive care unit. President Joe Biden only learned about the diagnosis of prostate cancer on Tuesday, the White House said. Mr Austin, 70, faced criticism after it emerged senior officials did not learn of his hospital visit for three days. He has since apologised for not ""ensuring the public was appropriately informed"". The defence secretary sits just below the president in the chain of command for the US military, and is one of the most important members of the president's Cabinet. The lag in notifying the White House raised potential national security concerns and issues of transparency within the Biden administration. The Pentagon confirmed Mr Austin remained hospitalised on Tuesday. A spokesman did not provide an update for when he would be discharged. ""Secretary Austin continues to recover well and remains in good spirits he's in contact with his senior staff and has full access to required secure communications capabilities and continues to monitor DoD his day to day operations worldwide,"" the spokesperson told reporters. At a press briefing on Tuesday, the White House faced repeated questions from journalists about the handling of Secretary Austin's hospitalisation. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said President Biden was informed ""today"" about the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ""Nobody at the White House knew that Secretary Austin had prostate cancer until this morning,"" he said. While he emphasised the president's initial reaction was concern for the secretary's health, Mr Kirby acknowledged the communications were ""not optimal."" ""This is not the way it is supposed to go,"" Mr Kirby said. Mr Biden and Sec Austin have not spoken since their last interaction over the weekend, according to Mr Kirby. Mr Austin caused controversy when he reportedly failed to alert the White House and top Pentagon officials to this January hospital stay. Mr Austin's deputy, Kathleen Hicks, was not informed of his hospital stay despite being asked to assume some of his responsibilities. At a Tuesday briefing, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder did not provide an explanation for why Mr Austin did not disclose his condition sooner. ""I don't have that specifically,"" he said, but noted that a prostate cancer diagnosis was ""deeply personal"". Mr Ryder said notification procedures about the hospital stay were under review to ""make sure we're doing better next time"". The Pentagon had said this failure occurred because a key staff member had the flu. On Tuesday, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients directed members of the president's Cabinet to provide notice when they cannot perform their duties. Doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the nation's top military hospital, provided the first full timeline of Mr Austin's diagnosis, treatment, and hospitalisation on Tuesday. A check-up in December 2023 ""identified prostate cancer which required treatment"", Dr John Maddox at Dr Gregory Chestnut wrote. Mr Austin was admitted to the nation's top military hospital on 22 December 2023 for a ""minimally invasive surgical procedure"" to remove the cancer. He was under general anaesthesia for this procedure. He returned to Walter Reed on 1 January 2024 after experiencing ""complications"" from the procedure, and an evaluation revealed a urinary tract infection. He was transferred to the intensive care unit the next day for further treatment, including for ""abdominal fluid collections impairing the function of his small intestines"". Dr Maddox and Dr Chestnut said that during this January stay, Mr Austin ""never lost consciousness and never underwent general anaesthesia"". The doctors wrote that Mr Austin infection has cleared and ""he continues to make progress and we anticipate a full recovery although this can be a slow process"". Doctors emphasised that cancer was caught early and said that his ""prognosis is excellent"". Prostate cancer affects millions of Americans, and about 1 in 8 American men will develop the condition in their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society. African American men are at particularly risk of the disease. They are more likely to develop the cancer than other men, and about twice as likely to die of the condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control.","['United States', 'Prostate cancer']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3D0/production/_132263914_gettyimages-1857870634-1.jpg'],"['Kayla Epstein', 'Bernd Debusmann']",World,US & Canada

On Tuesday, Boeing's president and chief executive Dave Calhoun said the firm was ""acknowledging our mistake"". The door ""plug"" which fell away from the aircraft weighed 27kg (60lb) and was used to fill an emergency exit that was built into the plane, but not required by Alaska Airlines.

It has also been revealed that the airline placed restrictions on the aircraft following pressurisation warnings in the days before the incident, investigators have said. Speaking to Boeing staff, Mr Calhoun said: ""We're going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake. We're going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way."" Mr Calhoun reassured staff that Boeing would work with the NTSB to investigate the cause of the accident. ""They will get to a conclusion… the FAA [Federal Aviation Authority] who has to now deal with airline customers who want airplanes back in service safely and to ensure all the procedures are put into place, inspections, all the readiness actions that are required to ensure every next airplane that moves into the sky is in fact safe and that this event can never happen again,"" he said.

His motorcade accessed the Washington DC courthouse through a back garage and Mr Trump sat silently with his lawyers through the 75-minute hearing. Speaking afterwards from the Waldorf-Astoria hotel -- which was until recently a Trump hotel -- he said his side was ""doing very well"" in the case and claimed he was facing political persecution from the Biden administration. The former president is accused by special counsel Jack Smith of trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory in 2020. Mr Trump, 77, maintains he should not face criminal charges because he was acting as president at the time. He has for years cited presidential immunity in his efforts to thwart civil and criminal cases brought against him. This case, which will probably next make its way to the US Supreme Court, could have a profound effect on the future of the American presidency and what is allowable by an individual who holds the office. It may also delay Mr Trump's criminal trial for weeks, if not months, during a fractious 2024 political campaign in which the former real estate mogul is a leading contender. As soon as the case began, the three judges on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit - Karen Henderson, J Michelle Childs and Florence Pan - asked probing questions about the implications of their decision. Judge Pan, a Biden appointee, sounded particularly sceptical. She asked Mr Trump's attorney, Dean John Sauer, whether he would contend that a president could sell presidential pardons and state secrets, or order Navy SEALs - the elite US special forces - to assassinate a political rival, without being concerned about criminal prosecution. Mr Sauer's argument boiled down to the idea that a president who is not convicted for impeachment by Congress cannot be subject to criminal proceedings. Mr Trump, he noted, was impeached but never convicted by the US Senate. But James Pearce, the government's attorney, said such a precedent could easily be short-circuited and undermine Congress and any potential criminal proceedings. All a sitting president would have to do is resign before the legislature is able to begin impeachment proceedings to avoid prosecution, he said. ""What kind of world are we living in if... a president orders his SEAL team to assassinate a political rival and resigns, for example, before an impeachment - not a criminal act,"" he said. ""A president sells a pardon, resigns or is not impeached? Not a crime,"" Mr Pearce added. ""I think that is an extraordinarily frightening future."" More widely, Mr Sauer also contended that prosecuting a president for his actions in office could paralyse government, particularly the executive branch. He claimed that authorising ""the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora's Box from which the nation may never recover"". He posed the hypotheticals that George W Bush could be prosecuted for ""giving false information to Congress"" to make the case for the invasion of Iraq, and that Barack Obama could face charges ""for allegedly authorising drone strikes targeting US citizens located abroad"". While the judges seemed open to the government's arguments, they also expressed concern that their decision could lead to the ""Pandora's Box"" raised by Mr Trump's attorneys. Worried a broad ruling could create an opportunity for individuals to unnecessarily prosecute a future rival in the White House, Judges Henderson and Childs both asked how they might issue a ruling that would not ""open the floodgates"" to ""tit-for-tat"" prosecutions. The answer may not be immediately clear, however. The decision made with regard to Mr Trump's appeal will decide how a major American trial will continue and could have major implications for the office of the presidency. The immunity defence has already been rejected by US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in December, who ruled that having served as president does not entitle one to a ""lifelong 'get-out-of-jail-free' pass"". In legal filings ahead of this hearing, Mr Smith, the special counsel, warned that a failure to allow Mr Trump to be prosecuted ""threatens to license presidents to commit crimes to remain in office"". In a fundraising email on Wednesday, Mr Trump said President Biden and Mr Smith were ""attempting to strip"" him of his rights. A poll by CBS News suggests most Americans believe Mr Trump should not be protected from prosecution for actions he took while president. The criminal trial in this election fraud case is scheduled for 4 March, but is on hold pending a ruling on the immunity claim. The trio of judges on the DC appeals court comprise two judges appointed by Democratic presidents and one by a Republican, and is expected to deny Mr Trump's appeal. Legal observers saw long odds for Mr Trump in this case. ""I think it's fairly certain that the three-judge panel is is probably going to rule against him on this particular issue,"" said Hans von Spakovsky, legal analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He expected Mr Trump to appeal in the event of a loss. Whichever way the judges rule, the case is widely expected to end up in the US Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority.

Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny on Tuesday set the bail for Duane ""Keffe D"" Davis at $750,000 (£590,000). Mr Davis, 60, was charged in September in the murder of Shakur, who was 25 when he was shot in a drive-by in Las Vegas in 1996. He has pleaded not guilty. During the Tuesday hearing, which Mr Davis attended, his court-appointed attorneys argued he should be released because he is a grandfather and that no evidence suggests he would flee before trial, news outlet KLEW reported. They also said their client is in declining health following a battle with cancer. His lawyers asked for bail to be set at around $100,000. Prosecutors claimed Mr Davis posed a danger to the public as a former gang leader. Judge Kierny said that, while Mr Davis has not tried to flee, his time in a gang played a role in the bail decision. ""There are lots of people who are still scared of him,"" Judge Kierny said. Mr Davis is accused of planning the 7 September 1996 shooting with his nephew, Orlando Anderson, following a fight with Shakur in a casino. Officials have shared security footage in which several men are seen kicking and punching Anderson. They allege the altercation ultimately led to the retaliatory shooting of Shakur as he was waiting in his car at a red light. The hip-hop legend died in hospital a few days later. Police also said that Mr Davis got the gun from an unnamed associate, and mentioned Mr Davis's ""own admissions"" to media outlets that he was in the vehicle where the shots were fired from. The three men who were in the car with Mr Davis at the time of the shooting, which included his nephew, have all since died. Shakur, whose stage name was stylised as 2pac, was one of the most acclaimed names in hip-hop and sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Mr Davis' arrest 27 years after the murder came after authorities searched his home and said they found materials connected to the shooting. Though Mr Davis is charged with planning the shooting, authorities have not said who actually fired the gun.",['United States'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E250/production/_132263975_gettyimages-1768687952.jpg'],['Madeline Halpert'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67929439,US Moon mission has no chance of soft lunar landing,"A US lunar lander has ""no chance"" of making a soft landing on the Moon due to a fuel leak, the company behind the mission says.",2024-01-09,"A US lunar lander has ""no chance"" of making a soft landing on the Moon due to a fuel leak, the company behind the mission says. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic said there was enough propellant to operate its Peregrine lander as a spacecraft. The lander is expected to run out of fuel in about 40 hours, the firm said shortly after 17:00 GMT on Tuesday. Peregrine ran into trouble almost as soon as it came off the top of its launch rocket on Monday. ""Given the propellant leak, there is, unfortunately, no chance of a soft landing on the Moon,"" Astrobotic said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. ""The team has updated its estimates, and we currently expect to run out of propellant in about 40 hours from now - an improvement on last night's estimate. ""The team continues to work to find ways to extend Peregrine's operational life."" The 1.2-tonne lander was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 02:18 ET (07:18 GMT) on Monday, with the intention of landing in late February. But in the first few hours of its journey, engineers noticed the would-be Moon lander was struggling to keep its solar panels looking in the direction of the Sun to charge its battery. The cause was quickly attributed to a major leak in the propulsion system that was pushing Peregrine out of alignment. To maintain the correct orientation in flight, Peregrine's thrusters are now having to work overtime, consuming even more of the diminishing fuel supply. Astrobotic calculates the craft has under two days' worth of propellant left before reserves are exhausted and the spacecraft starts tumbling. When that moment arrives, Peregrine, with its solar panels no longer collecting sunlight, will rapidly lose power. Even before Tuesday's announcement from Astrobotic, it had become clear that a touch-down on the lunar surface - the first for the US in half a century - was all but impossible. The US space agency, Nasa, had purchased capacity on the lander for five instruments to study the lunar surface environment ahead of sending astronauts there later this decade. Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa. Alongside two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly - they had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024. Nasa believes its new lunar partnership with the private sector will introduce more innovation and reduce costs over time. And the agency says it is prepared for some of these missions not to work. The Peregrine craft was launched aboard the first flight of Vulcan, a rocket that had been under development for a decade by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.","['Nasa', 'The Moon', 'Space exploration', 'Pittsburgh']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C977/production/_132257515_peregrine.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11017/production/_132255696_gdwxnh7wyaayrnm.jpg']",['N/A'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67908727,"Margot Robbie, Taylor Swift and more on Golden Globes red carpet",The 2024 awards season kicked off in style at the Golden Globes - the first major red carpet event of the year.,2024-01-09,"The 2024 awards season kicked off in style at the Golden Globes - the first major red carpet event of the year. A four-month strike kept actors away from the red carpet for much of the second half of 2023, but Hollywood stars made up for lost time and dressed to impress. Compared to the Oscars, the Golden Globes are usually a more relaxed affair, often resulting in a more playful mood on the red carpet. Margot Robbie - star of one of the night's biggest films, Barbie - was certainly having fun with her outfit. Robbie wore a series of pink looks for last year's promotional tour but it seemed she saved the best for last, wearing a custom-made replica 1977 Superstar Barbie outfit by Armani consisting of a hot pink sequinned dress accessorised with a tulle stole. Taylor Swift arrived in colourful sequins, too - for her, a striking green gown. The singer, nominated for best cinematic and box office achievement for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, walked the red carpet without her NFL boyfriend Travis Kelce, who was busy with a game a few miles away at LA's SoFi stadium. Red was the colour of choice for many celebrities. Julianne Moore wore a structured Bottega dress complete with deep pockets - which she said she wished contained snacks to get her through the three-hour show. Florence Pugh wore a sheer red Valentino gown covered in delicate roses. Inside she was seen embracing another lady in red, singer Selena Gomez, who wore asymmetric silk Armani Privé. Ayo Edebiri, star of The Bear, looked stunning in strapless red Prada and later was named best actress in a musical or comedy series. It wasn't just the women wearing crimson. Saltburn star Barry Keoghan looked resplendent in red custom Louis Vuitton. Keoghan is one of several male actors shaking things up on the red carpet. Gone are the days when the men all turn up in matching black tuxedos. Andrew Scott, up for a best actor award for his role in All of Us Strangers, dressed top-to-toe in white. Timothée Chalamet's sequinned Celine Homme jacket was relatively tame compared to some of his previous get-ups. The Bear's Jeremy Allen White - who recently became the new face (and body) of Calvin Klein underwear - kept it simple with a black suit, though his sheer shirt hinted at why he landed the modelling gig. The Last of Us's Pedro Pascal appeared to be sporting an injury, but his arm sling was dressed fabulously in Bottega Veneta. For many of the women, black proved to be the go-to option. British actress Rosamund Pike, nominated for her role as an aristocratic matriarch in Saltburn, accessorised her black lace dress with a dramatic matching headpiece - not entirely a fashion choice. She says the ""protective veil"" is because she hurt her face in a skiing accident over Christmas. Jennifer Aniston also wore black - custom Dolce & Gabbana - but much more exciting than her outfit was that she appeared to have brought back the famous ""Rachel"" haircut from Friends. Jennifer Lawrence kept it simple in a black Dior dress, Angela Bassett an off-the-shoulder velvet number and Greta Gerwig in black high-necked satin. More colourful was Oprah Winfrey in a purple Louis Vuitton dress - a nod to The Color Purple, which she co-produced. Helen Mirren chose a lavender Dolce & Gabbana dress with a matching opera coat. Pop star Dua Lipa, attending both as a presenter and a nominee for best original song, wore a custom black velvet Schiaparelli dress featuring a series of gold ""bones"" on the bodice and a voluminous bustle skirt. She wasn't the only music star to stand out on the red carpet. Billie Eilish wore a mostly thrifted and DIY outfit consisting of an oversized jacket, a skirt that resembled shorts, and a pair of geek-chic glasses. Lily Gladstone, who gave a stand-out performance in Killers of the Flower Moon, proved she's equally commanding on the red carpet. She wore a white Valentino gown with a dramatic black shawl, accessorised with earrings designed by a member of the Blackfeet Tribe. The actress has frequently used her promotional appearances to showcase indigenous craftspeople. Gillian Anderson, meanwhile, wore a dress by designer Gabriela Hearst. She said it was embroidered with female anatomy, in a protest against restrictions on women's rights, Deadline reported. But if some used the red carpet to make a political statement, others were just happy to take the chance to shine - quite literally. Elizabeth Debicki, who won for her portrayal of Princess Diana in The Crown, wore a shimmering metallic gown. And Barbie's Issa Rae was a real life golden girl in a dazzling Pamela Roland gown. It was a suitably sparkling start to the 2024 awards season - proving the red carpet is well and truly back in business.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67899302,"From Bill to Michael, why Mr Haley switched names","The circumstances surrounding the name change of Michael Haley, at the suggestion of his wife and Republican politician Nikki Haley, has sparked debate about names and identity.",2024-01-09,"The circumstances surrounding the name change of Michael Haley, at the suggestion of his wife and Republican politician Nikki Haley, has sparked debate about names and identity. Do we resemble our names? And if so, what's the difference between a Bill and a Michael? These are the questions being asked after an excerpt from Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley's 2012 book Can't is Not an Option resurfaced on social media this week. In it, Ms Haley said that when she first started dating her husband, South Carolina National Army Guard Michael Haley, he went by Bill. ""You just don't look like a Bill,"" Ms Haley said she told him. Instead, Ms Haley decided, his middle name was a better fit. ""From that point on, I started calling him Michael, and all my friends did the same,"" she wrote. ""He looks like a Michael."" ""Before we know it, he was universally known as Michael,"" she added. It's rare that an adult changes their name in this way, naming specialists told the BBC, and unusual to go from one commonly used name to another. ""There are so many Williams and Michaels of different ages, how could you say who was a Bill and who was a Michael?"" said Sophie Kihm, a psychologist and editor of naming website Nameberry. With this kind of switch so uncommon, most people have names picked by their parents. A name often says more about the parents and family who chose it rather than the child to whom it was given, though it can still play a role in a child's identity and personality. As a result, some parents go to great lengths to choose one, paying hundreds of dollars to consultants as they search for names that both ""stand out and fit in"", said Colleen Slagen, a baby name consultant. Some parents come looking for a ""CEO"" name, she said - one that their child could grow into that would look polished on a resume. The classics are Oliver and James for boys, Margot and Charlotte for girls. Others are more focused on tradition or values, Ms Kihm said, like Sophie or Benjamin. ""We know stuff about political leanings through names, how old someone's parents might have been when they had them, location and what part of the country they're from,"" she said. For instance, she said, liberal parents tend to choose more traditional names for their children because they tend to be older when they have them. Conservative parents may be more likely to choose a nickname like ""Josie"" both because they tend to have children younger and because it's a more common name in the southern part of the US, where Republicans have a stronghold on many states. Whatever the choice, we have a tendency to grow into these names, some research has shown. In one study, researchers asked more than 1,000 participants to match a picture of a person to a name from a list. Controlling for factors like race and age, researchers found humans were better able to pick the right name than if they chose randomly, suggesting that on some level, humans do resemble their names. That's in part because people tend to pick names for their children associated with the background they come from, said Yonat Zwebner, an author of the study and a Reichman University assistant professor. In turn, people tend to treat them in accordance with the stereotype associated with their name, which can change their personality and appearance, she said. ""It could be the hairstyle, the facial expression, it could be all kinds of things that are related to facial appearance,"" Dr Zwebner said. The idea that people grow up to embody their names is a phenomenon called ""nominative determinism"", Ms Kihm said. Ms Slagen said she believes most people grow to like their names because their personality becomes it, rather than their name dictating what their personality becomes. It's difficult to say whether a name change so late in life played a role in Mr Haley's personal development. The switch to his middle name might have allowed him to carve out some space for his own identity, as his adoptive father went by Bill Haley, too, Ms Kihm said. Still, names are strongly tied to people's identities, so it seemed peculiar that such a personal decision be made by someone else for him, she said. But she added: ""He seemed to roll with it pretty well, and Bill and Michael are relatively similar anyways.""","['United States', 'Names', 'Nikki Haley']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/181DD/production/_132218789_gettyimages-1495698787.jpg'],['Madeline Halpert'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67915771,Alaskan Airlines flight 1282: Key questions behind door plug blowout,"Alaska Airlines flight 1282 was on a routine flight from Portland in Oregon to Ontario in California, when an unused cabin door broke away a few minutes after take off.",2024-01-09,"Alaska Airlines flight 1282 was on a routine flight from Portland in Oregon to Ontario in California, when an unused cabin door broke away a few minutes after take off. The section that fell from the sky was a 27kg (60lb) part of the shell. Known as a door plug, this was used to fill an emergency exit that was built into the plane but not needed by Alaska Airlines. The cabin abruptly depressurised, creating a rush of air that ripped off the flight crews headsets and sent phones and other items flying out of the plane. The aircraft was delivered to Alaska Airlines on 31 October 2023, and would only have completed around 100 flights a month. Normal wear and tear or maintenance failures are unlikely to have been factors affecting such a young aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSF), which is investigating the accident, has already said it does not suspect a design flaw. In fact, this type of door has been used on older Boeing 737s since 2006, and has not suffered any serious issues. That means the focus is likely to be on whether the door itself could have been faulty, and whether it was bolted in place correctly. Alaska Airlines says it has since inspected other planes of the same type - Boeing 737 Max 9s - and discovered ""some loose hardware"". Meanwhile, United Airlines says bolts in need of ""additional tightening"" have been found while inspecting the relevant parts of its own fleet of 737 Max 9s. The door was produced by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which has previously faced criticism for serious quality control failures. But Boeing itself has been accused in the past of chaotic conditions in its factories and corners being cut on the production line. Boeing insists that is not the case today, and emphasises that safety is its first priority. The discovery of the missing door will provide vital clues for investigators about what went wrong and why. The 737 Max 9 has been ordered by many different airlines. The way they use those planes will not always be the same, and there are different options available for seating. The number of emergency exits required depends on the number of seats. With a less crowded cabin, it can operate with four main doors, and another four smaller exits over the wings. But if configured with the maximum number of seats, a further two exits are required - midway between the wings and the tail of the aircraft. In practice, Boeing builds all its Max 9 airframes with these extra doors. If they are not required, a non-operational door, or ""plug"" is fitted, concealed behind the interior trim. The light that came on in the cockpit is known as an ""auto pressurisation fail"" light. It comes on when the pressure in the cabin, which is usually regulated automatically, changes at an unusually fast rate. The crew can respond by adjusting the cabin pressure manually, or if concerned by descending to a lower altitude. However, such warnings can also appear due to minor faults. In the case of the Alaska Airlines plane, the light had come on during several flights over a short period. The issue had clearly been reported to maintenance staff, whose response would have been dictated by the aircraft's maintenance manual. This is a document written by Boeing, but signed off by regulators. Restrictions were placed on where the plane could fly, and according to the NTSB additional investigations had been ordered, but had yet to be carried out when the failure occurred. In the immediate aftermath of Friday's accident (this is the term used by the NTSB), Alaska Airlines grounded its entire fleet of 65 737 Max 9 aircraft. However, on Saturday 18 planes were briefly allowed back into service. Those planes had recently undergone major overhauls, including inspections of door plugs. No problems had been found and the company believed they were safe. But when the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive banning affected aircraft from flying until they had undergone specific checks, it had no option but to ground all 18 planes once again. The NTSB is carrying out a full investigation. This will involve, for example, examining the plane itself, the lost door (which has now been found in a back garden in Oregon), the contents of the flight data recorder and maintenance records, as well as interviewing flight crew, maintenance staff and employees of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. The purpose of the investigation is to find out what went wrong and why. It is not meant to apportion blame. However, there is clear jeopardy here for Boeing. The 737 Max is its bestselling aircraft, a favourite among airlines because of its low running costs and fuel efficiency. But its safety record has already been badly tarnished as a result of two accidents that occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people were killed.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67911193,'Thank you Bob': Search for plane's blown-out panel ended by teacher,"Two phones and a ""door plug"": these are some of the items found in Oregon days after Alaska Airlines flight 1282 lost part of its fuselage at 16,000 feet.",2024-01-09,"Two phones and a ""door plug"": these are some of the items found in Oregon days after Alaska Airlines flight 1282 lost part of its fuselage at 16,000 feet. The Boeing 737 Max 9 made a safe emergency landing on 5 January after an outer section of the plane blew off minutes into the flight from Portland. None of the 177 people on board were seriously injured in the incident. But the search continues for other lost belongings and parts, thought to include a cushion from the seat immediately next to the blown-out section of fuselage - which was thankfully unoccupied. One of the key missing items, the door plug, was found by a local school teacher named Bob, according to US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chair Jennifer Homendy. The discovery came after officials from the NTSB asked the public for help finding the door plug - a 27kg (60lb) piece of fuselage with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. They believed the door could have landed around Barnes Road, near Oregon-217 and the Cedar Hills neighbourhood, based on radar data. During a news conference, Ms Homendy said Bob sent in a picture of the missing piece, which ended up in his backyard in Portland. ""I can just see the outside of the door plug from the pictures, the white portions,"" Ms Homendy said. ""We can't see anything else but we're going to go pick that up and make sure that we begin analysing it."" ""Thank you Bob,"" she added. The NTSB has since recovered the door plug from the teacher to aid in its ongoing investigation into the incident. Taking a walk near Barnes Road, another man claimed he found a ""perfectly intact"" iPhone believed to belong to a passenger. Sharing photos of his discovery on X, formerly Twitter, game designer Sean Bates said the NTSB told him it was the second phone to be found. Mr Bates' photos show the stretch of Barnes Road where he said he found the phone, along with a picture of it - no cracks to be seen, but with a broken-off piece of what used to be a white phone charger still attached to it. He joked that it was possible that the phone's airplane mode feature being turned on helped it survive the 16,000ft (4,876m) drop. ""It was still pretty clean, no scratches on it, sitting under a bush and it didn't have a screen lock on it,"" Mr Bates said in a TikTok video. ""I opened it up and it was on airplane mode with a travel confirmation... so I had to go call the NTSB."" The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (£55) checked baggage charge for the flight. Several passengers have described their fear during the incident, which happened shortly after take-off en route to Ontario, California. Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: ""There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped. ""They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it."" Jessica Montoia, another passenger, described the flight as a ""trip from hell"", adding that a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind. It is unclear whether that phone is the same Mr Bates found on his walk. Around 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft remain grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as safety checks continue. Meanwhile, investigators have said the specific Alaska plane involved in Friday's incident experienced pressurisation warnings in the days before.","['Oregon', 'United States', 'Aviation accidents and incidents', 'Aviation safety', 'Boeing']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1157B/production/_132253017_portland_flight_reroute_2x640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BE7/production/_132255279_gdwafwjaqaedplt-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8C3E/production/_132220953_81602d9cb3df876d092d23574b77fbd4e42a80c2.jpg']",['Sofia Ferreira'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67928735,Bob Menendez: US Senator holds back tears and denies charges on Senate floor,US Senator Bob Menendez held back tears as he gave a fiery speech on the Senate floor about his bribery charges.,2024-01-09,"US Senator Bob Menendez held back tears as he gave a fiery speech on the Senate floor about his bribery charges. The New Jersey Democrat denied the charges and rejected calls to resign, saying it would deny him due process. Three federal indictments, which also implicate Egypt and Qatar's governments, allege Mr Menendez used his political office to enrich himself. He said he faced ""persecution not prosecution"" and refused to ""step aside"" by leaving his office. Mr Menendez initially faced bribery charges in September, after he and his wife were accused of accepting gold bars, gifts, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to aid three New Jersey businessmen. A second indictment in October alleged that the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair had conspired to work as a foreign agent for Egypt, acting on requests given by military and intelligence officials from the country. The most recent indictment, unsealed on 2 January, claimed that the politician received cash, tickets to a Formula One race and gold bars for helping a New Jersey real estate developer negotiate a multimillion-dollar deal. It also accused him of connecting the businessman to the Qatari royal family who run an investment firm. Mr Menendez has denied all the charges and told his Senate colleagues on Tuesday that he has ""never violated the public trust"". He alleged prosecutors had released the charges in phases as a way to ""poison the jury pool"" by keeping the ""sensationalism in the press"". The businessmen connected to the alleged scheme have also denied wrongdoing. To the claims that Mr Menendez made public comments in favour of Qatar in order to help one of the businessmen - Fred Daibes - secure an investment, Mr Menendez said it was part of the ""carrot and stick of diplomacy"". ""I have criticized Qatar as I have any other country when I felt they were falling short on their international obligations and applauded them when they have led in ways that the United States and the world would commend,"" he said. Mr Menendez also listed multiple instances in which he said he directly confronted Egypt President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for his country's ""unjust detention of American and Egyptian citizens, its human rights abuses"" and ""its deepening relationship with Russia"". He considered the encounters as evidence that he was not acting as a foreign agent to Egypt. ""You can't challenge the leader of an authoritarian state in public... and take actions adverse to their interests, and at the same time serve as an agent of that same foreign government,"" he said. Despite Mr Menendez's claims of innocence, pressure for him to resign has grown, including from within his own party. He said ""there is no evidence of the giving or receiving of cash and gold bars"", and he pleaded for his colleagues to wait for the truth to come out during trial. At one point, the New Jersey Democrat grew emotional as he reflected on what the charges might mean for his political legacy. ""After 50 years of public service, this is not how I wanted to celebrate my golden jubilee,"" he said. The senator's trial is scheduled to start in May in Manhattan.",['N/A'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/F830/production/_132263536_gettyimages-1796002580.jpg'],['Brandon Drenon'],World,US & Canada

Ray Epps, 62, pleaded guilty last year to disorderly conduct. He was pictured outside Congress on 6 January 2021, but did not go inside the building. Epps, who has always denied claims by fringe news outlets and online activists that he was a federal agent, avoided jail at a hearing on Tuesday. In addition to one year of probation, he was sentenced to 100 hours of community service. Epps was captured on video in Washington on 5 January and 6 January 2021, after traveling to the city from his home in Arizona. In footage from the night before the riot, he was seen urging people to enter the Capitol building. Members of the crowd were suspicious and chanted back ""Fed! Fed!"" - accusing him of being a law enforcement official. The following day, during the riot itself, Epps was seen on another video whispering into the ear of a man who then charged at police lines. Epps later said he unsuccessfully tried to calm the man down. After the riot, conspiracy theories began to circulate online that Epps was secretly working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but the bureau denies that he was ever an employee or a source. The videos of Epps, along with reports that law enforcement did have confidential sources among some of the extremist groups at the Capitol, became a key point driving the speculation. The rumours started on alternative news outlets and fringe social media accounts, and were then referenced on mainstream outlets including Fox News. They became part of a larger effort in some right-wing circles to minimise the day's events and shift the blame for the riot away from the crowd of Mr Trump's supporters. Epps, a former member of the Oath Keepers militia, said that he got carried away with his mistaken belief that widespread fraud swayed the 2020 election and his support for Mr Trump. ""I have learned that truth is not always found in the places that I used to trust,"" Epps said via video link during Tuesday's hearing in Washington. Defence attorney Edward Ungvarsky said in a statement that he welcomed the decision and that it would allow Epps and his wife ""to try to move forward and try to repair their lives from the incessant verbal and other attacks on Mr Epps that have led to very real past and current concerns for their physical safety"". The arrest and sentencing have not quelled the rumours about Epps, with the claims continuing online on Tuesday. Epps has pushed back on the allegations. In July, he sued Fox News over the rumours, accusing the network of defamation and claiming he had to close his business and move to Utah due to threats and harassment that he and his wife received over the conspiracy theories. Fox has said its on-air hosts were entitled to share constitutionally ""protected opinions"" about Mr Epps. At least 1,265 defendants have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot, according to the latest figures from the US Justice Department. More than 900 have pleaded guilty or have been convicted.","['US Capitol riots', 'Conspiracy theories']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10CED/production/_130354886_rayepps1.jpg'],['Mike Wendling'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67915696,Peregrine lander: Time running out for US Moon mission,The American company that launched a mission on Monday to try to soft-land on the Moon says it may not be able to control its spacecraft for much longer.,2024-01-09,"The American company that launched a mission on Monday to try to soft-land on the Moon says it may not be able to control its spacecraft for much longer. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic is fighting a fuel leak from its Peregrine lander, which is making it hard to maintain stable pointing of the spacecraft. Mission life could now be measured in just hours, the firm said. Certainly, a touch-down on the lunar surface - the first for the US in half a century - is no longer possible. ""At this time the goal is to get Peregrine as close to lunar distance as we can before it loses the ability to maintain its Sun-pointing position and subsequently loses power,"" a statement from Astrobotic read. The 1.2-tonne lander was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with the intention of landing on the Moon's northern hemisphere in late February. The US space agency (Nasa) had purchased capacity on the lander for five instruments to study the lunar surface environment ahead of sending astronauts there later this decade. Peregrine ran into trouble almost as soon as it came off the top of its launch rocket. Engineers noticed the would-be Moon lander was struggling to keep its solar panels looking in the direction of the Sun to charge its battery. The cause was quickly attributed to a major leak in the propulsion system that was pushing Peregrine out of alignment. To maintain the correct orientation in flight, Peregrine's thrusters are now having to work overtime, consuming even more of the diminishing fuel supply. Astrobotic calculates the craft has under two days' worth of propellant left before reserves are exhausted and the spacecraft starts tumbling. When that moment arrives, Peregrine, with its solar panels no longer collecting sunlight, will rapidly lose power. Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa. The agency is buying transport services from the Pittsburgh firm and two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly. Together, the trio had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024. Astrobotic is supposed to be delivering a Nasa rover to Earth's natural satellite towards the end of the year. All three US companies may have Nasa as their lead ""customer"", but the agency is not in charge of their projects. It is the firms themselves who have designed the spacecraft and are in command as the missions progress. And the companies are free to sell additional payload space to anyone who wishes to purchase it. Peregrine, for example, is carrying some mini rovers for US and Mexican groups. It also has a consignment of human, and even dog, remains on board. Small capsules contain the ashes of tens of individuals, including Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and his wife, Majel, who was the voice of the computer on the USS Enterprise. Nasa believes its new lunar partnership with the private sector will introduce more innovation and reduce costs over time. And the agency says it is prepared for some of these missions not to work. Speaking to the BBC last month, deputy administrator Pam Melroy, said: ""What we have learned from our commercial partners is if we have a high enough cadence, we can relax some of the requirements that make it so costly, and have a higher risk appetite. And if they fail, the next one is going to learn and succeed."" It will of course be frustrating for all those involved in the Peregrine project to see it fail. Dr Simeon Barber from the UK's Open University led the development of the sensor in one Nasa instrument on the spacecraft. He told BBC News: ""We started work on this particular project in 2019: it's been four years. The instrument was built through a pandemic: it was tough. This new way of doing space exploration does come with inherent risks. We know it's harder to do things right first time. So, the whole point of having a fleet of missions to the Moon in future years is to increase the chances of success.""","['Pittsburgh', 'The Moon', 'Space exploration', 'Exploration of the Moon', 'Nasa']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C977/production/_132257515_peregrine.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11017/production/_132255696_gdwxnh7wyaayrnm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/311F/production/_132257521_nasalander.jpg']",['Jonathan Amos'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67919436,Boeing 737 Max 9: United Airlines finds loose bolts in jet inspections,"Bolts in need of ""additional tightening"" have been found during inspections of Boeing 737 Max 9s, United Airlines has said.",2024-01-09,"Bolts in need of ""additional tightening"" have been found during inspections of Boeing 737 Max 9s, United Airlines has said. United Airlines said ""installation issues"" relating to door plugs would be ""remedied"" before the aircraft type would return to service. Inspections began after a section of the fuselage fell from an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 on Friday. Alaska Airlines says it has since found ""some loose hardware"" on some Max 9s. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which regulates air travel in the US, has grounded 171 planes of the same type. United said: ""Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug - for example, bolts that needed additional tightening."" The door plug is a piece of fuselage, with a window, that fills the space where an emergency exit would be in certain configurations. It was this part of the Alaska Airlines plane which dramatically fell off mid-flight over the US state of Oregon, eventually landing in a teacher's back garden. The aircraft made an emergency landing but none of the passengers or crew were seriously injured. The plane's door plug was recovered from a teacher's backyard in Oregon and was found without the four bolts, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Monday night. Its chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters that it's possible the bolts were missing from the start but they may have come off in the descent. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s used in the US are operated by United Airlines and Alaska, while Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico have also grounded jets of the same model for inspections. United said it had cancelled 200 flights as of Monday and expected significant cancellations on Tuesday. ""We have been able to operate some planned flights by switching to other aircraft types, avoiding about 30 cancellations each on Monday and Tuesday,"" United added. Alaska Airlines said that initial reports from technicians preparing its 737 Max 9 fleet for inspection indicated ""some loose hardware was visible on some aircraft"". ""When we are able to proceed with the formal inspection process, all aircraft will be thoroughly inspected in accordance with detailed instructions provided by the FAA in consultation with Boeing,"" it said. ""Any findings will be fully addressed in a matter that satisfies our safety standards and FAA compliance. The formal inspections will also require documenting all findings and those will be reported to the FAA. No aircraft will be returned to service until all of these steps are complete."" Earlier, the FAA said it had provided a checklist for operators to adhere to during inspections. The FAA said all 737 Max 9 aircraft would remain grounded until operators ""complete enhanced inspections which include both left and right cabin door exit plugs, door components, and fasteners"". ""Operators must also complete corrective action requirements based on findings from the inspections prior to bringing any aircraft back into service,"" the statement added. Flight 1282 reached 16,000ft (4.8km) when it began its emergency descent on Friday evening, according to flight tracking data. Images shared online - and later by investigators - showed a wide hole in the side of the craft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. Passengers were quoted by The Oregonian newspaper as saying that a young boy seated near the affected area had his shirt ripped off by the force of the decompression. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is leading an investigation into the incident, said pilots had reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made by the specific Alaska Airlines Max 9 involved in the incident. The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water so that the plane ""could return very quickly to an airport"" in the event the warnings happened again, NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy said. It is not clear if there is a link between the issues that led to those warnings, and the issue that caused the blowout on 5 January. Alaska Airlines said in its most recent statement: ""While we await the airworthiness directive (AD) inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections of the mid exit door plugs on our 737-9 Max fleet. ""The 737-9 Max grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have cancelled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected."" Boeing said in a statement: ""Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers."" The company's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues. In late 2018 and early 2019, two of its aircraft were lost in near identical incidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots.","['Boeing', 'United Airlines', 'United States']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/71CF/production/_132253192_alaska_door_diagram_640-nc-2x-nc.png'],['James Gregory'],World,US & Canada

Mr Trump is among 19 people charged with a conspiracy to overturn the state's 2020 election results. But his lawyers said ""no President ever faced criminal prosecution for acts committed while in office"". If the judge accepts the claim, it would mark a massive expansion of the president's powers of immunity. ""From 1789 to 2023, no President ever faced criminal prosecution for acts committed while in office,"" Mr Trump's lawyers wrote in the Monday filing. ""That unbroken historic tradition of presidential immunity is rooted in the separation of powers and the text of the Constitution."" On Tuesday, a federal appeals court hearing in DC heard arguments over the same presidential immunity claims as Mr Trump tries to throw out a separate election interference case brought forward by special counsel Jack Smith. Mr Trump attended the hearing before the three-judge panel. The former president has for years cited presidential immunity in his efforts to thwart civil and criminal cases brought against him. But this defence was already ""convincingly and comprehensively"" rejected by US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in December, University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias told the BBC. Ms Chutkan wrote that the presidency does not ""confer a lifelong 'get-out-of-jail-free' pass"" on past holders of the office. Mr Trump's lawyers also argued the Georgia criminal case should be tossed out on grounds of double jeopardy - that he was already tried and acquitted on similar charges in the US Senate following the Capitol riot in 2021. Finally, in a separate motion, Mr Trump's lawyers argued that the case violates his due process and First Amendment rights. ""President Trump did not have fair warning that his alleged conduct, pure political speech and expressive conduct challenging an election, could be criminalized,"" the filing says. Georgia's Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis brought the charges against Mr Trump and 18 others last year, in a 41-count indictment for alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. Mr Trump was charged with 13 criminal counts including an alleged violation of Georgia's Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico). His other charges include solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiring to commit impersonating a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery, conspiring to commit false statements, and writing and conspiring to file false documents. On Monday, a motion brought on behalf of Michael Roman, one of the co-defendants in the Georgia case, alleged there was an ""improper"" romantic relationship between Ms Willis and one of the lead prosecutors working the case. The motion included no concrete proof of the allegations, which were based on an anonymous source. Mr Roman's legal team is seeking to get his charges dismissed ""on the grounds that the entire prosecution is invalid and unconstitutional"". Ms Willis' office said it will respond to the allegations through court filings. Prosecutors have suggested an August 2024 trial date, which would disrupt Mr Trump's general campaign if he is chosen as the Republican presidential nominee. Four of Mr Trump's co-accused have pleaded guilty in the case.","['United States', 'Donald Trump', 'Indictments of Donald Trump']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/75C1/production/_132254103_gettyimages-1913446477.jpg'],['Chloe Kim'],World,US & Canada

""There is no plan for anything other than for Secretary Austin to stay in the job,"" White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters. Mr Austin, 70, remained in hospital as of Monday morning, Mr Kirby added. It emerged on Sunday that it took three days for Mr Biden to learn of the defence secretary's hospital stay. The defence secretary sits just below the president in the chain of command for the US military and must be available at all times to respond to any national security emergency. The Pentagon's failure to disclose Mr Austin's illness has drawn criticism. Leading Republicans, including Donald Trump, have called for Mr Austin to be fired. Senior Democrats have expressed alarm over the failure to disclose the hospital stays. On Monday, Mr Kirby said the White House would look into what happened. ""We'll do what's akin to a hot wash and try to see if processes and procedures need to be changed at all or modified so that we can learn from this,"" Mr Kirby said. ""The president's number one focus is on his [Mr Austin's] health and recovery, and he's looking forward to having him back at the Pentagon as soon as possible,"" he said. On Sunday, a Pentagon spokesman revealed that Mr Austin had undergone an elective medical procedure on 22 December and returned home the next day. The medical issue has not been disclosed. But he began experiencing ""severe pain"" on the evening of 1 January and was admitted to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington DC, Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder said. Mr Ryder added that the defence secretary was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and he ""remained in that location in part due to hospital space considerations and privacy"". Even as he assumed his full duties on Friday, Mr Austin remained in hospital, but no longer in the ICU. In a statement on Saturday, the retired four-star general said: ""I recognise I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better."" The United States has a civilian-controlled military, and the armed forces need to know who is in charge at any one time. Officials told CNN that Kathleen Hicks, the Pentagon's second-in-command, began assuming some of her boss's responsibilities last Monday, New Year's Day, while she was on holiday in Puerto Rico. But she was not informed until 4 January that Mr Austin was in intensive care, US media reported. The White House only learned last Thursday, too, that Mr Austin was in hospital. No-one within the chain of command was notified earlier because Mr Austin's chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, was off sick with flu, according to defence officials. Gen Ryder told CNN the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been notified on Tuesday. Gen CQ Brown, however, is a subordinate adviser who does not fall in the chain of command. Military service secretaries were not notified until Friday, Mr Ryder conceded. Pressure will now grow on the secretary of defence to disclose more about his health problems. It comes amid the US's deep involvement in two current theatres of conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine.","['United States', 'US Armed Forces']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/172E/production/_132243950_gettyimages-1857842179-1.jpg'],"['Sam Cabral', 'Gary O’Donoghue']",World,US & Canada

He has not been charged with a crime, denies rape allegation and had refused to resign despite pressure from allies. ""I believe it was almost unanimous vote to remove Christian Ziegler, which I believe is the absolute right thing to do,"" a source who attended the meeting on Monday in Tallahassee told NBC News. ""And I want to reiterate that we are spending a lot of time and energy on this, on this meeting instead of focusing on the things we need to focus on, and that's simply because Christian Ziegler did not do the right thing and resign.""

The Sarasota Police Department in Florida is investigating a woman's accusation that Mr Ziegler raped her at her apartment in October. According to heavily redacted police documents, Mr Ziegler, his wife, Bridget Ziegler and the woman had planned a threesome that day, but Mrs Ziegler was unable to attend. Mr Ziegler arrived alone, the complaint alleges, and assaulted the woman. Last week, police expanded their probe to include allegations that he illegally recorded his sexual encounter with his accuser without consent. An investigation is ongoing. No charges have been filed against Mr Ziegler, who has said the encounter was consensual. He did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The accusation has brought a rapid fall from grace for the Zieglers, a conservative Florida power couple with growing political influence on the national stage. Bridget Ziegler, an elected member of the Sarasota County School Board, is co-founder of Moms for Liberty, a national right-wing advocacy group born out of a resistance to Covid-19 school closures and mask mandates. She has resisted calls to resign, fielding criticism from many who cast Mrs Ziegler - who with her husband has promoted anti-LGBT policies - as a hypocrite. State Republicans in Michigan over the weekend also voted to oust their party chairwoman, Kristina Karamo, due to claims of poor fundraising.","['United States', 'Florida', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12B3/production/_132078740_gettyimages-1813811822.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4DF/production/_132078626_gettyimages-1845892610.jpg']",['Max Matza'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67916162,Boeing shares stumble after mid-flight blowout,Shares in Boeing have slumped after one of its planes was involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout in the US.,2024-01-09,"Shares in Boeing have slumped after one of its planes was involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout in the US. A cabin panel tore off a 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines, forcing an emergency landing and prompting safety officials to ground the same-make jets installed with the affected door plug. The US plane-maker's shares ended Monday trading down 8%, while shares in supplier Spirit Aerosystems fell 11%. The incident added to quality questions facing the firms. ""It's more about the whole perception of Boeing as an operator and its long-term safety record,"" John Grant, chief analyst at the aviation analytics firm OAG, told the BBC's World Business Report programme. ""You have lots of individual incidents that are adding up to a very long catalogue of problems for Boeing and indeed for their airline customers who need to use these aircraft."" Boeing has been trying to emerge from the shadow of two high-profile crashes involving a different 737 model, the Max 8, in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people. Boeing started developing the 737 Max in 2011 as a more fuel-efficient option for short and medium-length flights. It has been popular with airlines but dogged by questions about quality arising from electrical faults, loose bolts and other issues, some of which have also involved Spirit AeroSystems. Before the emergency near the Portland, Oregon airport, the firms' history had already drawn the attention of safety campaigners. After the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded 171 of the fleet of more than 200 737 Max 9 planes for inspection, leading hundreds of flights on Alaska, United and other airlines to be cancelled. United on Monday said preliminary inspections had uncovered instances of installation issues related to the door plug - ""for example bolts that needed tightening"". The news sent shares lower in afternoon trading. Analyst Mr Grant said the industry generally had been having supply chain issues and struggling to deliver planes on time, leading to pressure to move more quickly. ""You just sense that perhaps something has slipped in Boeing and it's been like that for a couple of years and they haven't got to grips with it,"" he said. ""Boeing are really going to come back under the microscope again."" Boeing said earlier Monday that the assembly under review was not found on other Max jets and that it was committed to safety and working with regulators. Spirit AeroSystems, which made and installed the part, had named a new chief executive in October. It said in a statement on Monday that its ""primary focus"" was ""the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures we deliver"". ""We are grateful the Alaska Airlines crew performed the appropriate procedures to land the airplane with all passengers and crew safe,"" Spirit said in its statement. ""Spirit is a committed partner with Boeing on the 737 program, and we continue to work together with them on this matter."" The plane involved in Friday's emergency had been cleared to fly and put into service a few months ago. Alaska Airlines staff had flagged it for pressurisation issues and the airline had restricted it from long flights over water. Since the 2018 and 2019 accidents, arch-rival Airbus has taken the crown of world's top plane-seller, expanding its market share against Boeing. Shares in the European firm rose more than 3% in trade on Monday.","['Boeing', 'United States Capitol', 'Companies']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2355/production/_132254090_gettyimages-1910141194.jpg'],['Natalie Sherman'],World,US & Canada

""When you face death in the eyes, I have so much to look forward to,"" the gymnast said in her first interview since she was in hospital last October. Retton became the first American woman to win the all-around gold in 1984. ""I am blessed to be here because there is a time when they were about to put me on life support,"" she said. Speaking to NBC for the first time since her health scare,  Retton said there are still unanswered questions about her illness. ""I have no idea what the future holds for me. I don't know if I'm going to have lasting issues with my lungs,"" she said in the interview that aired on Monday. ""I wish I had answers."" After her win in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Retton was nicknamed ""America's Sweetheart"". She appeared on Wheaties cereal boxes and was named Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportswoman of the Year. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997. Retton, who is now breathing with the help of a nasal oxygen tube, says she is not giving up. ""This is serious and this is life,"" she says, adding she is thankful to still be here. Recovering at her home near Houston, Texas, she says it has been difficult discussing her health in the public eye. ""I'm very private,"" she said. ""Usually my interviews are, 'Oh, yes — it felt great to win the Olympics,' you know? This is different."" News first emerged of her battle with pneumonia in early October, when one of her daughters launched a crowdfunding campaign for medical bills because the gymnast did not have health insurance. The family managed to raise $460,000 (£360,000) prior to her being discharged from hospital. In the NBC interview, Retton said she was struggling financially after a divorce in 2018 and the Covid-19 pandemic. ""I couldn't afford it,"" she said. ""But who would even know that this was going to happen to me? That's the bottom line, I couldn't afford it.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67913856,Biden seeks to rebuild black support at South Carolina church,"US President Joe Biden has warned of the ""poison"" of white supremacy as he seeks to shore up support from black voters in his bid for re-election.",2024-01-09,"US President Joe Biden has warned of the ""poison"" of white supremacy as he seeks to shore up support from black voters in his bid for re-election. Mr Biden, 81, was speaking at a black church in South Carolina, where a white supremacist gunned down nine black parishioners in a hate crime in 2015. ""The truth is under assault,"" he told the packed hall. ""This is a time of choosing. So let's choose America."" The speech was briefly derailed by hecklers demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. ""If you care about lives lost, you should care about Palestine,"" a woman shouted before a small group of demonstrators broke into chants of ""ceasefire now!"" inside the building. But the crowd drowned them out with chants of ""four more years!"" as they were escorted away by security, with one elderly woman standing up to proclaim the protesters ""don't understand"" that the president is a ""good man"". Four years ago, black Democrats in South Carolina helped turn Mr Biden's fortunes around in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. After coming in fourth and fifth respectively in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the former vice-president won the southern state and went on to win the party's nomination before beating Donald Trump in the general election. Mr Biden's return to South Carolina is a bet on the black vote, a crucial pillar of Democratic support. Ninety-two percent of black voters backed Mr Biden over Mr Trump for the White House in the last election. But recent polling shows that support may be faltering, with as many as 22% of black voters now leaning towards the Republican ex-president. There was no sign of that on Monday at the Mother Emanuel AME Church, where several hundred people packed into the warm, wood-panelled building to hear from Mr Biden. A mix of black and white supporters wearing Biden-Harris 2024 pins, the crowd welcomed the president with a standing ovation and lavished him with supportive chants. ""We love you Joe,"" screamed a handful of old ladies seated in the front pews, while an elderly man shouted ""Go Joe!"" from the upper deck. Introducing Mr Biden to the dais was Representative Jim Clyburn, the South Carolina politician whose influential endorsement propelled Mr Biden to victory in the state's primary in 2020. The congressman told CNN on Sunday that he was ""very concerned"" about the president's standing with black voters. Rattling off his achievements over the past three years, Mr Clyburn blamed the media for failing to report on Mr Biden's successes but said he had kept many of his promises. ""You know Joe, but more importantly, Joe knows us,"" he declared, referring to Mr Biden as ""the man best qualified, the man totally committed to making every American part of the American Dream"". When the president took the stage, he reminded the audience of how white supremacy had fuelled the hate crime inside the church eight years ago. ""The word of God was pierced by bullets of hate and rage"" but the Charleston community's ""act of grace"" in forgiving the gunman had ""brought down the Confederate flag"" in South Carolina, he said. Pivoting to his Republican opponents, he criticised those who seek to spread lies. ""Slavery was the cause of the Civil War,"" he said, in a rebuke of recent remarks by Nikki Haley, the state's former Republican governor who is now running for president. But Mr Biden reserved most of his ire for Mr Trump, who he accused of spreading false claims about the 2020 election, fomenting political violence and lacking ""respect for the 81 million people who voted the other way"". ""We must reject political violence in America. Always. It's never appropriate,"" Mr Biden said. ""Losers are taught to concede when they lose, and he's a loser."" Reminding voters in the room that he had chosen the first black vice-president and the first black female Supreme Court justice, Mr Biden added: ""Instead of erasing history, we're making history."" The campaign has bristled at the idea that it is losing support among black Americans. After the speech, senior campaign officials vowed to ""continue to communicate"" its 2024 message with a focus on showing the black community how it has followed through on its promises. ""Polls don't vote. Voters vote,"" principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told reporters after the speech. ""There's a long time before voters start to vote. And before that time, we have one job: to make voters understand that their choice is between President Biden offering more freedoms, not less, and what the Republican Party is trying to do."" He added: ""I want to be very clear - no president has done more for the black community than what Joe Biden has done."" Amid low approval ratings and signs of faltering support, Mr Biden has stepped up his engagement on the campaign trail. On Friday, he marked the third anniversary of the riot at the US Capitol with a speech in Pennsylvania, where he condemned Mr Trump in harsh terms and framed the November election as an ""existential choice"" for the country. Polls show Mr Trump with a narrow lead over Mr Biden ahead of their likely rematch. What do you want to know about the Iowa caucuses and the 2024 US election?

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67909417,Alaska Airlines plane had warnings days before mid-air blowout,"Alaska Airlines placed restrictions on the Boeing plane involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout after pressurisation warnings in the days before Friday's incident, investigators say.",2024-01-09,"Alaska Airlines placed restrictions on the Boeing plane involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout after pressurisation warnings in the days before Friday's incident, investigators say. The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water, said Jennifer Homendy of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB also says the missing section of plane has now been found - in the back garden of a Portland teacher. No-one was hurt in Friday's drama. After losing part of its fuselage, the plane - a Boeing 737 Max 9 - made a safe emergency landing after returning to its departure city, Portland. There were 177 passengers and crew on board the flight to Ontario, California. Some 171 planes of the same type remain grounded by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as safety checks continue. Before Saturday's intervention by the FAA, Alaska Airlines briefly returned some of its Max 9s to service, saying it had made ""no concerning findings"". Speaking at a news conference, Ms Homendy said pilots reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made by the specific Alaska Airlines Max 9 involved in the incident. The decision to restrict lengthy flights over water was so that the plane ""could return very quickly to an airport"" in the event the warnings happened again, the NTSB chief added. It is not clear if there is a link between the issues that led to those warnings, and the issue that caused the blowout on 5 January. ""An additional maintenance look"" was requested but ""not completed"" before the incident, Ms Homendy said. The plane was brand new having been delivered to Alaska Airlines in October - at which time it was judged by the FAA to be airworthy. Ms Homendy also used the conference to set out new details of the ""very chaotic"" and ""terrifying"" situation on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282. The force of the blowout caused the door of the cockpit to open and a laminated checklist and the first officer's headset both flew out into the cabin, she said. She added that no information from the cockpit voice recorder was available, as the recording had been automatically wiped after a two-hour cut-off was reached. The NTSB wanted this window to be increased to 25 hours, she added. Ms Homendy later announced that the part of the fuselage that detached had been found, after a teacher named Bob located the missing section in his backyard. ""I'm excited to announce that we've found the door plug,"" she told reporters. ""Thank you, Bob."" The plug is a piece of fuselage weighing 27kg (60lb), with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. Authorities had been searching for it in Portland, the departure city. Ms Homedy said it was the ""key missing component"" to work out why the blowout happened. Two mobile phones believed to have fallen from the aircraft are also reported to have been found. An Oregon man shared an image of an iPhone which he said he had discovered, working as normal, in a grass verge beside a road. The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (£55) checked baggage charge for the flight. Flight 1282 reached 16,000ft (4.8km) when it began its emergency descent on Friday evening, according to flight tracking data. Images shared online - and later by investigators - showed a wide hole in the side of the craft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. One passenger, Diego Murillo, said the gap left by the missing component was ""as wide as a refrigerator"". Passengers were quoted by The Oregonian newspaper as saying that a young boy seated near the affected area had his shirt ripped off by the force of the decompression. Alaska Airlines said in its most recent statement: ""While we await the airworthiness directive (AD) inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections of the mid exit door plugs on our 737-9 Max fleet. ""The 737-9 Max grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have cancelled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected."" Boeing said in a statement: ""Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers."" The company's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues. In late 2018 and early 2019, two of its aircraft were lost in near identical incidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots. After Friday's incident in the US, the European Union's regulator followed the example of its US counterpart. But it expected disruption to be minimal as it believed no European airlines used Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order. Icelandair said it was not affected. The real-time flight-tracking website Flightradar24 confirmed that a number of the airline's Max 9s were in the skies on Monday morning. The bulk of the affected planes are operated by US operators - 79 of them by United Airlines and 65 by Alaska - which has meant disruption for thousands of passengers.","['Oregon', 'United States', 'Aviation accidents and incidents', 'Aviation safety', 'Boeing']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BE7/production/_132255279_gdwafwjaqaedplt-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A04B/production/_132253014_portland_flight_reroute_2x640-nc.png']","['James FitzGerald', 'Kathryn Armstrong']",World,US & Canada

Mr Biden was subpoenaed to testify privately about his business dealings for the impeachment case against his father, President Joe Biden. He refused, and Republicans called his actions ""contemptuous"" and unlawful in a report published on Monday. Democrats say the case is a meritless partisan attack against the president. Rep James Comer, who chairs the Oversight Committee, released the report on Monday. It recommends that Hunter Biden face charges, which he will if a resolution is passed by Comer's committee and then the entire House. ""We planned to question Hunter Biden,"" Mr Comer said in a statement, ""but he blatantly defied two lawful subpoenas, choosing to read a prepared statement outside of the Capitol instead of appearing for testimony as required."" Mr Biden's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In November, Mr Biden told House Republicans that he was willing to testify to the Oversight Committee, but only if it was a public hearing. His counsel, Abbe Lowell, said it would ""let the light shine"" on the proceedings. Republicans refused, and instead Mr Biden made a rare in-person statement outside the Capitol on the day he was to appear before Congress. He slammed Republicans, alleging they had ""distorted the facts"" and called for a public hearing. He added that he would not testify privately, and said there was ""no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business, because it did not happen"". ""Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics, expose their baseless inquiry or hear what I have to say,"" the president's son added. ""What are they afraid of? I'm here. I'm ready."" The Oversight Committee, which Mr Comer chairs, is planning to consider the resolution on Wednesday morning. Its passage through that body is the first step toward it being considered by the wider House. At the same time, the Judiciary Committee - chaired by Rep Jim Jordan of Ohio - will review the report released on Monday that lays out the Republicans' case against Hunter Biden. The process will give opposition Democrats an opportunity to read the report and offer notes. But the entire House would have to vote to refer Hunter Biden to the Justice Department for contempt of Congress charges. Because of the razor thin majority Republicans have in the House, all of its members would likely have to vote to pass it. Republicans have led a months-long investigation into the president that has yet to uncover any concrete evidence of misconduct. The inquiry has centred in part around Hunter Biden, who also faces federal tax and gun charges. He has pleaded not guilty. The impeachment probe has focused on his work for companies overseas, including in Ukraine and China. House Republicans have also alleged that the US Justice Department ""impeded, delayed, and obstructed"" an ongoing multi-year criminal probe into the president's son. Democrats and even some Republicans have criticised the impeachment investigation, which the White House has called a ""political stunt"" designed to hurt the president's re-election bid.","['Hunter Biden', 'US Congress', 'Joe Biden', 'United States']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/182E5/production/_132254099_microsoftteams-image-4.png'],['Phil McCausland'],World,US & Canada

It is a major oil exporter, but rural areas and shanty towns suffer neglect. Pre-Columbian Mexico was one of world's cradles of civilization, and home to civilizations including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, Purepecha and Aztecs. In past decades, Mexico has been contending with high crime rates, official corruption, narcotrafficking and a stagnant economy. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the continuing organised crime killings and drugs-related gang violence since 2006, which saw the army being deployed to crackdown on drugs cartels. President Andres Manuel López Obrador Left-wing candidate Andres Manuel López Obrador won an overwhelming victory in the 2018 presidential election. His priorities are to tackle corruption and reverse decades of free-market economic policy - which he blames for social inequality, endemic violence, and the desire of so many young people to leave the country is search of a better life. Mr López Obrador, popularly known by his initials Amlo, is a former mayor of Mexico City, and stood for the presidency on two earlier occasions. Reporters Without Borders describes Mexico as ""one of the hemisphere's most dangerous countries"" for the media. Drug cartels and corrupt officials are implicated in most of the crimes of violence against journalists, which almost always go unpunished. Two big players, Televisa and TV Azteca, dominate the TV sector. Mexico is one of Latin America's biggest internet markets. Some key dates in Mexico's history: 1500BC - Beginning of Olmec culture - the first major Mesoamerican civilization. 600BC - Olmecs replaced by regional cultures such as Maya, Zapotec, Totonac, and Teotihuacán civilizations. 250-AD - Mayan civilization, based around Yucatan, grows to become one of the most dominant groups. Classical Mayan civilization reaches its peak c. 600AD in alliance with the Teotihuacán. 600-1000 - Toltecs migrate from north of Teotihuacán and establish their empire in the central valley of Mexico by 10th Century. Spread of militarism in Mesoamerican societies. 1200 - Toltecs defeated by Chichimecha alliance. 14th Century - The Chichimecha - or Aztecs - settle in Mexico's central valley, and found Tenochtitlán near Lake Texcoco. 1420s - Aztecs emerge as the dominant force in central Mexico. 1517 - Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, is the first European to visit Mexican territory. Arriving with about 100 men he withdraws after clashes with locals. 1519 - Spanish army under Hernán Cortés lands at Veracruz, marking the start of Spain's conquest of Mexico. 1521 - Cortés and his local allies finally defeat Aztec forces and capture Tenochtitlán. Cortés razes the city and builds Mexico City on its ruins. 1521-1820 - Mexico forms part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. 1810-21 - War of Independence ends with the creation of the short-lived Mexican Empire, which includes Central America to the southern border of modern-day Costa Rica, as well as what is now the south-western US. 1824 - Mexico becomes a federal republic. Central American provinces secede. 1833 - General Antonio López de Santa Anna becomes president after leading resistance to a Spanish attempt to recapture Mexico in 1829. 1836 - Texas, then part of Mexico, declares independence. After attempting to quell the rebellion in Texas, Santa Anna's forces are  defeated by rebel leader Sam Houston at San Jacinto. 1846-8 - Mexican-American War ends with Mexico being forced to sell its northern provinces (including modern-day California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah) to the US. 1861-67 - Mexico suspends payment on its foreign debts. France, Britain and Spain intervene to protect their investments. British and Spanish soon withdraw, but Napoleon III sends French troops to occupy Mexico City, and installs Austrian archduke Maximilian as emperor. 1865 - With the end of the US civil war, Washington increases support for the deposed Mexican government. 1867 - France withdraws its troops under US pressure. Maximilian elects to remain in Mexico, and is executed after being captured by Mexican forces. 1910-1920 - Mexican Revolution. The decade-long conflict sees te eventual establishment of modern Mexico's constitutional republic. Some 900,000 people are killed in the war - out of the 1910 population of 15 million - and a further 900,000 migrate to the US to escape the violence and seek work. 1929 - Formation of the National Revolutionary Party, which later becomes the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which dominates politics until 2000. 1941 - Mexico declares war on the Axis powers after Japan bombs Pearl Harbor, with Mexican pilots fighting against the Japanese in the Philippines, alongside US forces. 1968 - Student demonstration in Mexico City during the Olympic Games is fired on by security forces. Hundreds of protesters are killed or wounded. 1976 - Huge offshore oil reserves discovered. 1994 - Zapatista rebels demand improved rights for indigenous people in the Chiapas region. 2000 - Vicente Fox breaks ruling PRI party's seven-decade dominance by winning the presidential election. 2006 - President Felipe Calderon launches crackdown on drug gangs, with violence escalating into a national security crisis. 2018 - Left-wing former mayor of Mexico City, Andres Manuel López Obrador, wins an overwhelming victory in presidential elections.","['Mexico', 'US & Canada']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CACD/production/_129271915_bbcm_mexico_country_profile_map_040423.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/068B/production/_102457610_gettyimages-996401948.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CE20/production/_88986725_mexico_newspapers_g.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31E0/production/_88986721_mexico_villa_zapata_g.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8000/production/_88986723_mexico_poppy_g.jpg']",['N/A'],World,US & Canada

The actor is awaiting sentencing after a New York jury last month convicted him of attacking British choreographer Grace Jabbari. He told ABC News that the incident has been ""confusing in many ways"". ""I'm standing there and the verdict comes down. I say ... 'How is that possible?"" he said. ""Based off the evidence, based off the prosecution's evidence, let alone our evidence, how is that possible?"" he told the Good Morning America programme in an interview that aired on Monday. Majors said he plans to appeal his conviction on one count of third-degree assault and another count of second-degree harassment. He was acquitted of two other counts of assault and aggravated harassment in a split verdict. After the conviction, the Emmy-nominated actor was dropped by Marvel Studios, where he had starred in several films and TV series. He could face up to a year in prison when sentenced in February. The crime took place when Majors and Ms Jabbari were in a car in New York and she saw a text message from another woman on Majors' phone, which said: ""Wish I was kissing you right now."" Prosecutors say that when she took the phone, Majors grabbed her, twisted her arm behind her back and hit her in the head to get it back. Ms Jabbari was left with a fractured finger, bruising and a cut behind her ear. Majors has denied assaulting Ms Jabbari and filed charges against her, claiming she was the one who assaulted him. Prosecutors said the case lacked merit. Majors told ABC that he did not know how Ms Jabbari was harmed in the incident. ""I wish to God I knew. That would give clarity. That would give me some type of peace about it,"" he said. He claimed he has never hit a woman. ""I'm an athlete. I'm a sportsman. I know my body. I know how it moves. I know my strength, or lack thereof, you know? None of that was employed on her,"" he said. In a statement to US media, Ms Jabbari's lawyer said Majors continues to ""take no accountability for his actions"". ""The timing of these new statements demonstrates a clear lack of remorse for the actions for which he was found guilty and should make the sentencing decisions fairly easy for the Court,"" lawyer Brittany Henderson said. During the interview, Majors cried as he spoke about no longer being able to see his daughter because of the conviction. He also said that the ""world stopped"" when Marvel dropped him as an actor. He had been set to reprise his role in Avengers: Kang Dynasty. ""It's like you work so hard for things. And then, you know, it's done,"" Majors said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67908840,Host Jo Koy's jokes fall flat and six other Golden Globes moments,"The Golden Globe Awards on Sunday had everything - jokes which fell flat, public displays of affection, and plenty of Taylor Swift.",2024-01-09,"The Golden Globe Awards on Sunday had everything - jokes which fell flat, public displays of affection, and plenty of Taylor Swift. Oppenheimer, Poor Things and The Holdovers were among the big film winners, while Succession, Beef and The Bear scored some of the big prizes in the TV categories. The Globes lived up to its boozy reputation with the red carpet even having its own bar along the way, the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent Emma Vardy said. As the stars passed underneath the signature golden chandelier and greeted each other, the glamorous night had a feel-good factor about it, a big contrast from the animosity felt over the actors and writers strikes a few months ago. As the last champagne glasses are drained and the red carpet is rolled up, here are seven highlights from the ceremony: Comic Jo Koy, a first-time presenter at the Globes, struggled to get his opening monologue off the ground. As BuzzFeed's David Mack joked, Koy's monologue was, ""in a tribute to Oppenheimer, a bomb"". Koy himself seemed to acknowledge some of his jokes weren't catching fire - at one point, he told the audience: ""I got this gig 10 days ago, you want a perfect monologue?!"" Here's a selection of his one-liners: Koy's jokes throughout the night provoked a number of different reactions in the room. Selena Gomez was spotted with her head in her hands as the comedian made jokes about the Barbie movie. Viewers also took to social media to comment on the opening monologue. Erik Anderson of Awards Watch wrote: ""I thought the writers strike was over."" In 2023, Hollywood's writers went on strike for several months, picketing outside the studios of major studios including Disney, Netflix and Paramount, over pay and work conditions in the streaming age. When presenting the award for best screenplay, Daniel Kaluuya, Hailee Steinfeld and Shameik Moore defended the importance of screenwriters and poked fun at studio executives. Steinfeld started by saying ""This year we were all reminded of the critical importance of writer to the creative process."" Kaluuya continued: ""To demonstrate the importance of writers and writing, we asked that this segment be written not by writers, but by studio executives."" The trio then performed an incomprehensible skit, suggesting that studio executives could never do the work of the professional writers. Taylor Swift looked less than impressed when host and comedian Jo Koy took the opportunity to make a joke about the singer's relationship with American Footballer Travis Kelce. ""We came on after football double header,"" Koy said, noting the Globes had immediately followed a match. ""Do you know the big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? On the Golden Globes we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift."" As the camera panned to Taylor, she took a long, long sip from her glass and showed little reaction. Since the start of their relationship, Swift has frequently been seen cheering for boyfriend Kelce at Kansas City Chiefs games. (The Globes continue to cut to Swift for the rest of the night.) Well known for her athletic ability, mixed martial arts and stunt work, Michelle Yeoh is one actress you don't want to cross. Last year, Yeoh took home the Golden Globe for best musical or comedy actress for her performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once. As the pianist began playing to signal it was time to wrap it up, she joked ""Shut up, please. I can beat you up, and that's serious!"" Presenting the award this year, Yeoh referred back to last year, commenting that she was ""very chill"". ""I know last year I threatened to beat up the piano player if they tried to play me off my acceptance speech,"" she recalled. ""While I won't do anything if you cut me off this year, I will kick your ass if you cut off whoever is about to win this award right now."" But plenty of winners were told to wrap up this year too. Emma Stone seemed to have only just started her speech before she said: ""Oh my god, there's only like 18 seconds left."" To be fair to the Globes - the tight timings meant they finished only a few minutes late this year - Hollywood awards ceremonies often run much longer. More from the Golden Globes: Ayo Edebiri, who plays Sydney in The Bear, won the Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy TV series. In an unprepared speech, she recognised not just her agent and manager, but ""all of my agents and managers assistants"". ""To the people who answer my emails - Y'all are real ones. Thank you for answering my crazy crazy emails!"" she said. Earlier this week, Edebiri's co-star Jeremy Allen White, another winner at the Globes, launched his Calvin Klein campaign, causing a stir amongst fans online. Speaking to press after accepting his award for best actor in a musical or comedy TV series, he said: ""It's been a weird couple of days"". In true Jennifer Lawrence fashion, the actress provided the 2024 Golden Globes with one of its funniest and most unforgettable gags of the evening. Lawrence was nominated in the best actress in a motion picture comedy or musical category for her performance in the R-rated comedy No Hard Feelings. As the award was being announced, the Oscar winner mouthed ""If I don't win, I'm leaving!"" directly to the camera. Sure enough, she ended up losing to Poor Things star Emma Stone, but in the event, no one in the room looked happier than Lawrence. Stone and Lawrence are close friends, and Lawrence stood up and cheered when Stone's name was announced as the winner. Timothee Chalamet was nominated in the best actor - musical or comedy category for his performance as the title character in Wonka. He attended the ceremony with girlfriend Kylie Jenner. The pair have been dating for a few months, and although they didn't walk the red carpet together, they sat together inside. The Wonka star posed on the Golden Globes red carpet on his own, but once inside both he and Jenner appeared more interested in each other than the awards ceremony itself. Chalamet eventually went on to lose to Paul Giamatti's performance in the Christmas comedy drama The Holdovers, but he might not know that yet. It appears 2024 is just getting started for the celebrity couple.",['Golden Globes'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5D9A/production/_132226932_crgettyimages-1908169036.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ABBA/production/_132226934_crgettyimages-1908169512-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16F0A/production/_132226939_21be5794af2a84e472f225ad29fd7638e345f736.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F9DA/production/_132226936_crgettyimages-1908169932.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/146CE/production/_132226638_ce726067a68990bad29a41ec084f5389e1477f41.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6D3A/production/_132226972_e4595f9af1081d4344baf83ce8f8551642c9aa35.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147FA/production/_132226938_gettyimages-1908165827-1.jpg']",['Guy Lambert'],World,US & Canada

The instrument, part developed by RAL Space in Harwell, Oxfordshire, will analyse the atmosphere near the lunar surface and look for drinking water. It is onboard the Vulcan rocket which launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 07:18 GMT (02:18 EST). The instrument could prove vital for sustainable human space exploration. Peregrine Mission One is being carried out by the US space company Astrobotic on behalf of NASA, and is carrying five scientific instruments to help prepare for human missions to the Moon later this decade. Astrobotic's robotic lander, Peregrine, aims to become the first American mission in 51 years to complete a soft touch-down, and the first ever by a private company. Peregrine is part of a stampede of spacecraft that will attempt to put themselves on the lunar surface in 2024 - possibly as many as eight different projects, including from Japan and China. Peregrine Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (PITMS) has been developed by RAL Space in partnership with the Open University in Milton Keyes and NASA. RAL Space also designed the circuit boards to power the equipment. Production and software group leader Chris Howe said the project had been 22 months in the making and described PITMS as ""a nose that is going to sniff the lunar atmosphere"". ""I'm very, very pleased because it's the first launch of this particular rocket type,"" Mr Howe added. ""So we are saying if the instrument switches on OK when it's in space... then we will be able to say that is a success. ""The technology from PITMS will now help underpin future missions, such as the Rosalind Franklin Rover, so whilst PITMS will only operate for one lunar day on the moon, its legacy will be felt for years."" Dr Simeon Barber, Luna research scientist at the Open University, added that if useful space resources could be found and purified, they could then be used ""as drinking water for astronauts and that should make for cheaper and faster, more sustainable missions"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67894917,Peregrine lander: Vulcan rocket launches US private Moon mission,"An US spacecraft has launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to try to perform a controlled landing on the Moon.",2024-01-09,"An US spacecraft has launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to try to perform a controlled landing on the Moon. It's aiming to become the first American mission in 51 years to complete a soft touch-down, and the first ever by a private company. Astrobotic's robotic lander, called Peregrine, has been contracted by Nasa to carry five scientific instruments. These will study the Moon's surface environment ahead of human missions later this decade. Peregrine is part of a stampede of spacecraft that will attempt to put themselves on the lunar surface in 2024 - possibly as many as eight different projects, including from Japan and China. Astrobotic's venture was sent on its way by a brand new rocket called Vulcan, which left its Florida pad at 02:18 EST (07:18 GMT). Fifty minutes later, after a flawless flight, the Pittsburgh-based company's craft was ejected on a path to the Moon. It will take a few weeks to get itself into position to attempt the touch-down. The planned 23 February descent will target a smooth lava plain on the Moon's near-side known as Sinus Viscositatis, or ""Bay of Stickiness"" - a reference to the type of volcanic material that may have built nearby hills. Not since the last Apollo mission in 1972 has there been any US effort to place a spacecraft gently on the lunar surface - although US probes have been deliberately crashed into the Moon for one reason or another in the meantime. Running surface operations is back on the agenda because Nasa wishes soon to resume astronaut missions, and it is going to use robots from commercial partners to deliver scientific instrumentation, general equipment and supplies - a move the agency believes will work to reduce costs over time. Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander under this new arrangement. Two other companies, Intuitive Machines and Firefly, will follow in the coming months. Indeed, it's possible Houston-based Intuitive Machines may even beat Astrobotic to the surface because although its lander is not due to launch until mid-February, it's taking a quicker route to the Moon. All three US companies have Nasa as a ""customer"", but the agency is ""not in charge"" of their missions. It is the firms themselves who have designed the spacecraft and will be in command as the missions progress. ""This initiative is incredibly important,"" said Andy Jones, director of landers and spacecraft at Astrobotic. ""It's allowed a small company like Astrobotic to deliver a lander to the Moon. We'd never have been able to achieve it without that. But the best thing is it's bringing a lot more creative minds, new minds, new thinking to the table, and that will help accelerate the technologies needed to get us back to the Moon and have a more robust presence on the Moon."" Nasa's payloads on Peregrine are focused on preparations for the later human presence on the lunar surface. The Peregrine Ion Mass Spectrometer (PITMS), for example, will try to understand better how water moves across the Moon. Water is seen as a potential resource for future astronauts, either for drinking or as the basis of a rocket fuel. The main sensor in PITMS was built in the UK by the Open University (OU) and RAL-Space. The OU's Dr Simeon Barber led the development. ""Water is really important for astronauts to drink, for sanitation. It's really the key molecule for unlocking the future and a new way of doing space exploration,"" he told BBC News. Because Nasa is classed as just a customer on the mission, Astrobotic has been free to sell payload space to others. The most significant of these additional items are a number of small rovers, including a clutch of tiny two-wheeled robots from Mexico. There are also cultural items onboard, such as photos, drawings, plaques and audio recordings, but, controversially, there is a consignment of cremated human remains, too. Two companies have small ""memorial"" capsules on Peregrine, one of which contains the DNA of renowned British science-fiction writer Arthur C Clarke. This is something that has drawn the ire of the Navajo Nation, the North American indigenous people, who regard the Moon as sacred. They've appealed to Nasa to stop the mission, which they see as an act of desecration. The first of 2024's lunar touch-down attempts will be conducted by the Japanese space agency (Jaxa) and is expected on 15 January. Jaxa's Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) will target a location near Shioli crater, which is just south of the Moon's equator on its near-side. China will continue its recent exploration efforts on the Moon by sending a mission to the far-side to bring some of the rocks there back to Earth for study. This should happen mid-year. While the focus in the coming weeks will be squarely on Peregrine's travels, It's worth reflecting also on the success of the Vulcan, which was making its maiden flight after 10 years of development. The company behind the vehicle - United Launch Alliance - has an established pedigree of putting up US national security missions and Nasa missions. Vulcan will take on this work as ULA's current stable of rockets is retired. The company's president and CEO, Tory Bruno, couldn't hide his joy at the conclusion of the new rocket's ascent. ""Yeehaw!"" the executive, who is often seen in a cowboy hat, shouted. ""I am so thrilled. I am so proud of this team. Oh my gosh, this has been years of hard work.""","['Pittsburgh', 'The Moon', 'Space exploration', 'Exploration of the Moon', 'Nasa']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F0C9/production/_132214616_screenshot2024-01-05at14.20.45.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5489/production/_132214612_eugene_cernan_at_the_lm_apollo_17.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DFA3/production/_132215275_mons_gruithuisen_4145_h1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14B7C/production/_132206848_18f5e233-e10a-4333-bf70-646d5fca1eb9.jpg']",['N/A'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67907039,Fugitive Nicholas Rossi faces 15 years in jail if convicted of rape,An American fugitive who has been extradited from Scotland to the United States could face two life sentences if he is convicted of raping two women.,2024-01-09,"An American fugitive who has been extradited from Scotland to the United States could face two life sentences if he is convicted of raping two women. Nicholas Rossi is facing charges in two neighbouring jurisdictions in Utah. Prosecutors in the state say people convicted of rape are sentenced to five years to life, and typically serve between eight and 15 years. The 36-year-old is said to have faked his own death and was hiding in Scotland when he was arrested. He was discovered in a Glasgow hospital in December 2021. On Friday he left on a private flight from Edinburgh Airport after losing his final appeal against extradition. The convicted sex offender has been accused of raping a woman in the city of Orem in Utah County in 2008 and another woman in Salt Lake County later the same year. District Attorney for Salt Lake County, Sim Gill, told BBC Scotland News that Rossi will face separate trials for each allegation. His office and their counterparts in Utah County will decide who should prosecute him first. The Salt Lake County case involves a woman who came forward in January 2022 after Utah County requested Rossi's extradition from Scotland. She has alleged that they met through a dating app in 2008 when she was 26 years old. Court documents say the woman felt that Rossi was ""smart, university-educated and interesting."" She said they were discussing marriage when she started to have doubts about their relationship. Mr Gill said: ""After a period of time, she started to realise some things didn't add up. ""She started to pull back from that relationship and it's alleged that he became very angry with her in a parking lot. ""They decided to go home. He took her up to the bedroom and locked the door and sexually assaulted her against her will. It's alleged that he raped her."" Mr Gill said the length of jail time served by a convicted prisoner is decided by the parole board. He said: ""Rape is a first-degree felony in our jurisdiction, so the maximum could be up to life in prison, depending on the history of the person and the underlying facts. ""If he's in the custody, he's not going anywhere, so we will just bide our time and prosecute when our turn comes. ""The injury that is often suffered by victims of sexual crime is something that they never lose, and so trying to find a measure of justice is critical, regardless of when it happened."" The court papers from the Salt Lake County case say Rossi has been involved in ""criminal cases of sex assault, harassment and possible kidnapping in Rhode Island, Ohio, Utah and Massachusetts."" As an untried prisoner, Rossi will be held in a half-empty jail on the outskirts of a town called Spanish Fork. With the snow-capped Wasatch Mountains in the distance, Utah County Jail was designed to not look like a prison when it was built 30 years ago. Instead it resembles a community hospital, although a new security fence is being erected around the perimeter. Sergeant Garrett Dutson of Utah County Sheriff's Office said the jail has a capacity of 1,000 but is currently holding around 450 inmates. It houses prisoners who're waiting to go on trial and those serving sentences of under 12 months. ""There's multiple crimes from shoplifting to murder, from domestic violence and assault to child abuse, to sex crimes,"" said Sgt Dutson. ""I would say most criminals in our jails are there for drug-related crimes. ""I think the conditions are pretty good. We have programmes for the inmates. ""There's medical and educational things, there's religion, things like that to keep them occupied. ""They do spend a lot of time in lockdown. They can average 20 hours a day in their cell."" Rossi claimed to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight when he was fighting extradition, but a sheriff said fingerprints proved he was Nicholas Rossi.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67908646,US budget: Spending deal reached as shutdown deadline looms,US Congress leaders have reached a deal over the total amount of spending for the rest of 2024 as they seek to avoid a partial government shutdown.,2024-01-09,"US Congress leaders have reached a deal over the total amount of spending for the rest of 2024 as they seek to avoid a partial government shutdown. The $1.6tn (£1.2tn) figure includes $886bn for defence and more than $704bn for non-defence spending, according to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. However, there appears to be some discrepancy over the numbers. The deal now needs approval from the House of Representatives and Senate. They have less than two weeks to finalise funding and stop the suspension of some federal services. According to a statement from Democrats Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer - House Minority Leader and Senate Majority Leader respectively - the non-defence spending amount agreed is $772bn. Mr Johnson, announcing the deal had been reached in a letter to colleagues, accepted that the amount of funding ""will not satisfy everyone, and they do not cut as much spending as many of us would like"". The proposed plan accelerates an already agreed upon $20bn (£15.7bn) cut to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which would happen this year rather than over the next two years. It would also take back $6.1bn (£4.79bn) in unused Covid funds. Republicans have been seeking to freeze overall government spending by cutting some budgets. Sunday's deal includes greater protection from cuts to benefits and health - a provision demanded by Democrats. The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative Republican group within Congress, called the deal a ""total failure"". ""Sad to say but the spending epidemic in Washington continues with both parties being culpable,"" said Andy Biggs, the group's former chairman. In a statement, Mr Jeffries and Mr Schumer said the agreement ""clears the way for Congress to act over the next few weeks in order to maintain important funding priorities for the American people and avoid a government shutdown"". President Biden, meanwhile, said it ""moves us one step closer to preventing a needless government shutdown and protecting important national priorities"". Lawmakers are due to resume negotiations in Washington on Monday following the holiday break and have until 19 January to sort out funding for programmes including transport, housing and energy. A second load of annual funding, for sectors including defence, expires on 2 February. The agreement on an overall amount of spending comes after the government in October secured a short-term deal to avoid a federal shutdown temporarily, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden minutes before the deadline. Shutdowns normally happen when both chambers of Congress are unable to agree on the roughly 30% of federal spending they must approve before the start of each fiscal year on 1 October. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House and Democrats holding the Senate by a single seat, any funding measure needs buy-in from both parties. Repeated efforts to pass spending bills in the House in recent months have been thwarted in recent weeks by rebel right-wing Republicans. Meanwhile, an agreement has still not been reached on a separate bill which includes a further $50bn of military aid to Ukraine, as Congress continues to argue over migration policy at America's southern border. October's short-term deal to prevent a shutdown excluded new aid for Kyiv in a blow for Democrats, for whom this was a key demand. Some Republicans argue that any further funding would be detrimental to America's interests. Congress has so far approved more than $100bn (£78bn) in military, humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine since Russia began its full-scale invasion last year. Negotiations are also continuing about providing further security aid to Israel as it seeks to eliminate Hamas following the 7 October attacks.","['United States', 'US Congress']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AC1E/production/_132226044_gettyimages-1850429561.jpg'],['Kathryn Armstrong'],World,US & Canada

Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr were both recognised for their acting performances, while Christopher Nolan won best director. Succession scored the most wins in the TV categories following its acclaimed fourth and final season. Meanwhile, Barbie won the inaugural box office achievement award, after grossing $1.4bn (£1.13bn) worldwide. There were two wins each for Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers and Poor Things, and one for Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. The latter film's star Lily Gladstone was named best drama actress, making her the first indigenous person to win the award, something she described as ""historic"". Oppenheimer star Murphy paid tribute to Nolan's ""rigour, focus and dedication"" in making the film, which grossed $954m (£750m) at the box office and won best drama film at the ceremony. The biopic also won awards for best score and best supporting actor for Downey Jr, who portrayed US government official Lewis Strauss. Downey Jr acknowledged the film's unlikely box office success in his acceptance speech, joking: ""A sweeping story about the ethical dilemma of nuclear weapons grosses $1bn?"" The actor continued: ""Dozens of folks have come up to me since the summer time saying I was unrecognisably subtle as Lewis Strauss. To my fellow nominees, let's not pretend this is a compliment."" He also referred to the changes made to the Golden Globes membership following a scandal over corruption and a lack of diversity. ""Thanks for changing your game,"" he told the voting body. Murphy, who also starred in Peaky Blinders, played J Robert Oppenheimer in the film - the theoretical physicist described as the father of the atomic bomb. In his acceptance speech, Murphy said: ""I knew the first time I walked on Christopher Nolan's set that it was different. ""I could tell by the level of rigour, focus, dedication, and the complete lack of seating options for actors,"" he joked, ""that I was in the hands of a visionary director."" Murphy also joked about the number of Irish nominees in awards season this year - his fellow nominees in the category included Saltburn's Barry Keoghan and All of us Strangers star Andrew Scott. ""To all my fellow nominees, whether you're Irish or not, you're all legends, I salute you,"" Murphy said. Killers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone began her acceptance speech by speaking Algonquian language Blackfoot. The actress comes from a Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana. ""I just spoke a bit of Blackfeet language, the beautiful community nation that raised me, encouraged me to keep doing this,"" she told the audience. ""I'm here with my mum, who, even though she's not Blackfeet, worked tirelessly to get Blackfeet into our classroom. ""This award is a historic one. I'm so grateful I can speak even a little bit of my language, because in this business, Native actors used to speak their lines in English, and then their sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera."" In Killers of the Flower Moon, Gladstone plays Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman whose family members are brutally murdered as part of a plot by white settlers to move in on their land and take their fortune, fuelled by greed over oil. Succession was the big winner in the TV categories - following the fourth and final season of the drama about a media mogul and his children who battle for control of his company. Kieran Culkin, who played Roman Roy in the series, was named best leading TV actor - an award previously won by his co-stars Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong. ""I was nominated for a Golden Globe like 20 years ago,"" he recalled, ""and when that moment passed, I thought, 'I'll never be in this room again'. ""I accepted I was never going to be on this stage. But thanks to Succession.... this is a nice moment."" His co-star Sarah Snook was named best leading TV actress, and told the audience: ""This show has changed my life."" British star Matthew Macfadyen was also named best supporting actor for his role in the show. ""I just adored every second of playing the human grease stain that is Tom Wambsgans,"" he joked. The critically acclaimed show also won best drama series - seen as the night's top prize in the television categories. Barbie won the cinematic and box office achievement award - a newly added category this year which aimed to increase recognition of commercially successful films. ""We would like to dedicate to every single person on the planet who dressed up and went to the greatest place on earth - the movie theatres,"" said the film's star Margot Robbie. ""And thank you so much to the Golden Globes for creating an award that celebrates movie fans. This is a movie about Barbie but it's also a movie about humans. We made it for you, and we made it with love, and thank you for loving it back."" Billie Eilish also won best original song for What Was I Made For? - one of three songs which were nominated from the film's soundtrack. ""It was exactly a year ago when I was shown the movie, and I was very miserable and depressed at the time, and writing that song kind of saved me a little bit,"" Eilish said. Da'Vine Joy Randolph won best supporting actress for her portrayal in The Holdovers of a woman suffering immense grief after the death of her son. ""Mary, you have changed my life, you have made me feel seen in so many ways,"" she said, referring to the character she plays. ""And I hope I helped you all find your inner Mary, because there is a little bit of her in all of us."" Addressing the film's director Alexander Payne, she said: ""Thank you for giving me the opportunity to play this beautiful and flawed woman."" Her co-star Paul Giamatti was named best leading actor in a musical or comedy. He plays a teacher who is forced to stay in his boarding school over Christmas to look after the children who are not returning home for the holidays. Climbing the steps to the stage to accept the award, he joked his ""knees were shot"", adding: ""I'm never going to be in John Wick 5 at this rate."" He too paid tribute to Payne, calling him ""Alexander the Great, who for some mysterious reason continues to have enormous faith in me and I don't know why"". Giamatti concluded: ""[The Holdovers] is a movie about a teacher. My whole family are teachers, all of them going back generations. Teachers are good people, you've got to respect them, they do a tough job, so this is for teachers as well."" Courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall won best foreign language film and best screenplay. Its director Justine Triet recalled the process of writing the film with her partner Arthur Harari during lockdown. ""We were in the pandemic,"" she recalled, ""and my life partner and I, we spent our days co-writing the screenplay for Anatomy of a Fall, stuck in our apartment - and strangely, nobody died."" Other winners in the TV categories include Steven Yeun and Ali Wong - who were both recognised for their performances in Beef - and The Bear's Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri. Elsewhere, Elizabeth Debicki was named best supporting actress in a TV series for her portrayal of Princess Diana in The Crown. She thanked the show's producers ""for trusting me with this part"". She thanked her ""pretend children"" Ed McVey and Luther Ford, who play Prince William and Prince Harry on the show respectively. Emma Stone was named best actress in a musical or comedy for her performance in Poor Things, which also won best musical or comedy film. Poor Things sees Stone play a young woman, Bella Baxter, who goes on a journey of self discovery and sexual awakening as she travels around the world. ""Bella falls in love with life itself, rather than a person, she accepts the good and bad in equal measure,"" Stone said in her acceptance speech. ""And that really made me look at life differently, and that all of it counts. She has stayed with me deeply, so this means the world to me."" She thanked director Yorgos Lanthimos, saying she would be ""forever be grateful that we met"", and writer Tony McNamara, to whom she joked: ""I love getting to say this dialogue, and I love getting to horrify you with my Australian accent."" The Golden Globes mark the first major ceremony of film awards season, which culminates with the Oscars on 10 March.","['Television', 'Golden Globes', 'Film']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5F2A/production/_132226342_crgettyimages-1908164351.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12022/production/_132226737_crgettyimages-1908169612.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16226/production/_132226609_crgettyimages-1908169017.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13B16/production/_132226608_crgettyimages-1908166447.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5F8E/production/_132226442_crgettyimages-1908168101.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/368A/production/_132226931_compuntitled.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16D16/production/_132226439_crgettyimages-1908166829.jpg']",['Steven McIntosh'],World,US & Canada

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67907011,Boeing 737 Max 9: Jets to stay grounded as inspections continue,The US aviation regulator has said 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes will remain grounded until it is satisfied the planes are safe.,2024-01-09,"The US aviation regulator has said 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes will remain grounded until it is satisfied the planes are safe. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been inspecting the jets after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday. The FAA said its first priority was ""keeping the flying public safe"". Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun told staff that its response ""is and must be"" the focus of the company. Thousands of passengers saw their flights cancelled after major US airlines grounded dozens of the jets. ""We have grounded the affected airplanes, and they will remain grounded until the FAA is satisfied that they are safe,"" the FAA said in a statement on Sunday. Boeing also said that it will hold an all-employee meeting about safety on Tuesday to address its response to the incident. ""When serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don't happen again,"" Mr Calhoun said. Disruptions have primarily affected flights in the US. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s used in the US are operated by United Airlines and Alaska, while Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico have also grounded jets of the same model for inspections. Alaska grounded 65 planes, and said on Sunday that it had cancelled 163 flights, or 21%. Around 25,000 people were affected. The airline said travel disruptions from the grounding of some of its planes is expected to last until at least mid-week.United has grounded 79 planes, and said on Sunday it had cancelled about 180 flights. Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door - which they believe fell to the ground in the western suburbs of Portland - and have appealed to the public to help find the panel. During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. Passengers on board said a large section of the plane's outer shell fell to the ground shortly after take-off. Images sent to news outlets show the night sky and lights of Portland visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. One passenger said the gap was ""as wide as a refrigerator"" while another said a child's shirt was ripped off in the wind as the plane made its emergency landing. The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously. Boeing's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year and a half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other, killing those on board. More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.","['Oregon', 'Air travel', 'United Airlines', 'United States', 'Aviation accidents and incidents', 'Aviation safety', 'Portland', 'Boeing']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/07F3/production/_132253020_portland_flight_reroute_2x640-nc.png'],['N/A'],World,US & Canada

Bethany Cox, 22, from Eaglescliffe in Stockton, was accused of child destruction and using misoprostol to procure her own miscarriage in 2020. She pleaded not guilty to both charges at Teesside Crown Court in August 2023. Her defence barrister said the case was an ""extraordinary state of affairs"". Jolyon Perks, for the prosecution, told Teesside Crown Court the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was invited to review the case on 19 December and it was then that the decision was made not to proceed with the charges against Ms Cox. Mr Perks told the court a full review was carried out, before the defence was told on 22 December the case would not proceed as the CPS was ""not in possession of key evidence"" and there was ""no real prospect of a conviction"". Nicholas Lumley KC, for Ms Cox, said it was an ""extraordinary state of affairs"", adding that she gave birth in July 2020, at the end of the first Covid-19 lockdown, and ""in the throes of grief"" she was interviewed by police and was under investigation for three years before being charged and appearing in court in July 2023. It is not known how or when the baby died. Mr Lumley said it was ""beyond regrettable"" and Ms Cox had suffered so extensively, all the while ""grieving for what took place"". Judge Paul Watson, the recorder of Middlesbrough, said the court had ""no choice"" but to direct a not guilty verdict on both charges. Ms Cox did not appear at Teesside Crown Court on Tuesday. The two charges dated from the beginning of July 2020. She was charged under Section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which makes it an offence for a woman to unlawfully procure her own abortion. The first charge stated that on 6 July in Stockton she administered drugs to procure an abortion with the intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive. The second alleged that between 2 and 7 July she administered misoprostol with ""intent to procure your own miscarriage"". A CPS spokesperson said: ""Cases of this nature are carefully considered and a prosecution will only take place where the evidential standard has been met.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-67926737,"Medieval paintings found at Christ's College, Cambridge by builders",Medieval wall paintings hidden for almost 300 years have been uncovered by builders working in a roof space at a Cambridge University college.,2024-01-09,"Medieval wall paintings hidden for almost 300 years have been uncovered by builders working in a roof space at a Cambridge University college. The artworks were found during restoration work at Christ's College. The paintings celebrated the royal patron of Christ's College during the early 16th Century. Cambridge University art historian Dr Christina Faraday said: ""This is a really exciting and unusual discovery."" The three crowned motifs, depicting a red Lancastrian rose, portcullis and a probable fleur-de-lis, were found in First Court, which dates back to the 15th Century. The paintings are thought to be from the early 16th Century. The college was first established as God's House in 1437 before moving to its present site in 1448. It was re-founded as Christ's College in 1505 by Henry VII's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort. The portcullis was the badge of the Beaufort family. Dr Faraday, who specialises in Tudor visual and material culture, said the works revealed ""the ways that the college celebrated and advertised its royal patron during the early years of the 16th Century, following its re-founding"". ""A powerful and pious woman, with a keen interest in scholarship, Lady Margaret left her indelible mark on the college,"" Dr Faraday said. ""The wall paintings are an early example of her family's savvy use of visual 'branding' even beyond the royal court. ""Henry VII had a very weak claim to the throne, but became adept at using visual symbols like this to promote his kingship. ""The motifs continue to be tied up with the college's identity to this day, but as an early example of Tudor 'marketing', the wall paintings demonstrate the long history of something we think of as a modern phenomenon. ""Such survivals are extremely unusual."" The 20ft (6m) wide design - partially obscured by a wooden joist - is located in the roof space of what probably formed the north-west wall of the original library. It is painted on to a fine plaster layer with evidence of limewash applied around the designs. After the discovery was made, the college delved into its archives and found that the last known recorded sighting of the wall paintings was around 1738. The covered location in the roof space has enabled the paintings to survive in good condition, but means they will not be on general view. The college's master, Lord Simon McDonald, said: ""It was a surprise when these wall paintings, which have been hidden for almost 300 years, were revealed. ""I am privileged to be one of the few people to see them up close. ""After basic restoration, we will store the paintings away once again, a time-capsule which might be uncovered in another 300 years."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Zahra Ghulami suffered serious head injuries at her home in Gravesend on the 27 May 2020 and died two days later at a hospital in London. Jan Gholami, 33, was convicted by a majority verdict at Maidstone Crown Court on Tuesday. His wife, Roqia Ghulami, 32, was found not guilty of murder. However, she was found guilty of cruelty to a person under 16 and the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of allowing the death of a child. Gholami was also found guilty of cruelty to a person under 16 and will be sentenced on 16 February. The pair had denied all charges. Kent Police said Gholami claimed he was out food shopping when the incident happened at their home in Oak Road. A police spokesperson said medical evidence provided by specialists concluded that the fatal injury was likely to have been caused by Zahra being thrown to the floor or against a wall. During examinations, doctors found evidence of older injuries, which included a skull fracture, and a healing fracture to her arm and shoulder blade, police added. During the trial, prosecutor Sally Howes KC said Zahra suffered a skull fracture caused by ""significant impact with significant energy"" at the hands of Gholami. Ms Howes accused the father-of-four of taking out his ""bad temper"" on her. The girl's cause of death was given as a severe head injury and skull fracture by Professor Charles Mangham, an osteoarticular pathologist. Zahra was described as a ""bright, intelligent"" child who was ""highly curious"" and wanted to find out about everything. Senior investigating officer Detective Inspector Ross Gurden said: ""Zahra would have been six now, she would have started school and would be learning about the world around her, but instead her young life was cut short through violence inflicted by Jan, who should have been caring for her.""

Jude Keil, 10, from Bobbing in Kent was first taken to Medway Maritime Hospital in February last year with worsening shortness of breath. He is now in a wheelchair, unable to stand on his feet or move his arms or head, but his brain is unaffected. His family say doctors around the world have been unable to identify the cause. Jude was diagnosed with an unknown form of motor polyneuropathy, a general term used to describe diseases which affect the nervous system. His father Peter Keil said: ""Pretty much every neurologist in London - if not the UK - knows about Jude's case ""There are small glimmers of hope, but we can't say it's getting better because we just don't know."" His test results have been shared with doctors around the world, including in Spain, Germany and the United States. The family first noticed Jude was suffering with shortness of breath while on holiday in Morocco in September 2022. He was tested for asthma and breathing problems after returning home, before being referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT). He also had an endoscopy and further inconclusive blood tests. Jude was rushed to A&E after choking on some crisps in February 2023, and shortly afterwards an ENT specialist found a problem with Jude's epiglottis, which stops food going down the windpipe into the lungs, and he was kept in overnight for observation. The next morning he fell unconscious and was transferred to the Evalina Children's Hospital in London in an induced coma, spending more than 300 days in their care. His parents are afraid Jude's condition could progress or that his two-year-old sister, Elodie, may also be affected. ""300 plus days in hospital and they still don't know what it is, and they have literally tried everything,"" Peter said. Jude left the Evelina in December and spent four nights back at the Medway Maritime Hospital before returning home for Christmas. Despite his physical condition, Jude retains his mental capacity and has been able to continue studying with the help of an eye gaze tablet, where he can use his eyes to scroll instead of his hands. ""He can still roll his eyes - he gives you the best eye rolls in the business,"" said Peter. ""It's wonderful because we know it's still Jude inside. We want to make sure that he lives rather than just exists."" The family have launched a fundraiser, which has already raised £14,449, to help pay for specialist equipment including a stair-climbing chair and adapted vehicle.

The tribunal heard that on one occasion she was stripped down to her underwear during a training exercise. On another, she said a male officer pushed her down with his foot on the back of her neck while she was doing press-ups, before telling her having breasts ""does not mean you cannot do a press-up"".

The West Midlands force has now confirmed three serving firearms officers are currently suspended and 10 are in the disciplinary process. In a statement following the original tribunal, Mrs Kalam said: ""I had the ambition and drive to progress to the senior ranks, up to chief constable, and I was on track to do so."" She said she had loved her position and added: ""One of the reasons I stayed on in the department was to try and change the culture from the inside."" The decision to award her compensation for loss of earnings and pension was the ""unanimous decision of the tribunal panel"". The West Midlands force has not said how much it has spent on legal fees fighting the case that was brought by Mrs Kalam. Paul Odle, from Metropolitan Police Federation which has been supporting her, said: ""If we can't even protect your own from inside the organisation, how can we basically, frankly, be honest and protect the public if that's how we behave internally?"" In a statement, West Midlands Police said many of the issues date back to 2012 and in the past two years the firearms department under new leadership had worked hard to improve culture, standards and the working environment. ""There is no place in policing for misogynistic, discriminatory or disrespectful behaviour and much progress has been made to set and reinforce the highest standards of conduct and professionalism,"" DCC Green said. He added that the tribunal recognised the force had taken the grievance and disciplinary matters raised by Mrs Kalam seriously and it continued ""to make progress to ensure that we are trusted by the public as we go about our duty to protect them"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67927678,Boohoo considers shutting factory after BBC investigation,Boohoo is considering closing its first-ever manufacturing site after a BBC investigation found it had broken promises to make clothes ethically.,2024-01-09,"Boohoo is considering closing its first-ever manufacturing site after a BBC investigation found it had broken promises to make clothes ethically. The site in Thurmaston Lane, Leicester, opened in 2022, with plans for it to also be used as a training facility. But a reporter at the firm's headquarters saw evidence of staff pressuring suppliers to drive prices down, even after deals had been agreed. Boohoo said the plans were not related to the BBC Panorama investigation. The Manchester-based firm said fewer than 100 employees at the factory might be affected, and it expected ""some roles"" to be relocated. A spokesperson added: ""We opened Thurmaston Lane in January 2022 to support the group in several ways, including manufacturing, printing and training. ""As in any retail business, the role of our sites continues to evolve over time and following significant investments at our Sheffield distribution centre and the opening of a new distribution centre in the US, we must now take steps to continue to ensure we are a more efficient, productive and strengthened business. ""All these factors have led us to make the difficult decision to consider relocating some of the operations at Thurmaston Lane and consider the closure of the site in due course. ""We are now in a period of consultation and are working closely with all affected colleagues to ensure they are fully supported during this process."" The firm had faced allegations over poor pay and supply chain failings prior to the opening of the factory. At the time, Boohoo said it was ""committed to the city of Leicester and ethical British manufacturing"". In 2020, Boohoo pledged to overhaul its practices after claims it had tolerated widespread abuses of employment law at some of its suppliers in Leicester. An independent review of the claims, by Alison Levitt QC, found a series of failings. The review concluded that although Boohoo did not intentionally profit from the poor working practices, the firm's monitoring of these factories was ""inadequate"". The company then introduced Agenda for Change - which includes promising to pay its suppliers a fair price for garments, with realistic timescales. But BBC reporter Emma Lowther saw those promises being consistently undermined during her 10 weeks undercover at Boohoo's head office, where she worked as an admin assistant. The BBC investigation, published two months ago, revealed that Boohoo put pressure on suppliers to drive prices down - even after orders had been agreed. It also found hundreds of orders placed with Thurmaston Lane were actually being made by seven factories in Morocco, and four in Leicester. Boohoo's lawyers say Thurmaston Lane only makes 1% of all Boohoo's garments. At the time of the investigation, Boohoo said it ""has not shied away from dealing with the problems of the past and we have invested significant time, effort and resource into driving positive change across every aspect of our business and supply chain"".

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn on 21 July. Teesside Crown Court heard he shot at Mr Jackson after being ejected from the pub for attacking the manager when his bank card was declined. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. Opening the case, prosecutor Christine Egerton said Mr Bowser had been staying in a glamping pod at the remote pub, which is about nine miles from the nearest village of Reeth, near Richmond, North Yorkshire. The barrister said that on the day of the attack Mr Bowser had spent the evening drinking at the bar and had become aggressive when his bank card had been declined. She said when he had been asked to leave by the manager, Nichola Townsend, he had pushed and slapped her and a fight had broken out involving two other men, Ryan Lockwood and Karl Pearson. Ms Egerton said later that night Mr Jackson, a relative of Mr Pearson, had gone to find Mr Bowser, who had then produced a gun and held it to Mr Jackson's head. The court heard Mr Bowser had pulled the trigger but the chamber was empty and Mr Jackson fled to a nearby bunk room, closing the door behind him. The barrister said Mr Bowser had then fired four times at the door, with one of the bullets hitting Mr Jackson in the arm. Giving evidence, Mrs Townsend described Mr Bowser as a tall and ""very well-built man"" and said she had been left with bruising and pain to her neck after he had slapped her. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-67922173,Surrey Thames river levels inches away from floods of 2014,"Homes, businesses and roads have flooded in Surrey as the Thames continued to rise, with water inches away from levels seen 10 years ago.",2024-01-09,"Homes, businesses and roads have flooded in Surrey as the Thames continued to rise, with water inches away from levels seen 10 years ago. Almost the whole stretch of the river in Surrey is subject to warnings, affecting areas including Chertsey, Walton, Sunbury, Molesey and Egham. The Environment Agency said floods were on a par with those in 2013 but not expected to reach levels seen in 2014. One Staines-upon-Thames resident said: ""It's a repeat performance of 2014."" Police in Runnymede have advised the easiest way to get to and from Chertsey or Addlestone is now either the M25 or Thorpe Lea Road because all other directions are closed. Officers posed on Facebook: ""Coldharbour Lane is closed due to flooding. The water is coming through the service covers which is incredibly dangerous as it is only a matter of time before they come up from their fixtures. It has also emerged 32 people were evacuated from Abbeyfields mobile home park in Thameside, Chertsey, in the early hours of Thursday. Surrey Fire and Rescue Service who attended with police said crews arrived to find fast-flowing, deep water flooding homes. Residents were moved to alternative accommodation or a rest centre. In Staines, Ian Swinglehurst said the river there was about four inches (10cm) away from 2014 levels, with water levels continuing to rise. The government publishes regularly updated river, sea, groundwater and rainfall levels. Data on Tuesday showed: Mr Swinglehurst attributed rising river levels to run-off from fields and hills but also to the Environment Agency's use of the Jubilee River flood relief scheme, which diverts water in Berkshire and returns it to the Thames at Datchet. Carl Douglas, whose boat-building business at Laleham Reach has flooded, also blamed the Jubilee River, saying floods came in 2003 and 2014 after it came into use in 2002. An Environment Agency spokesman said: ""It is not true that the Jubilee River results in increases in downstream water levels, putting those communities at greater risk. ""After the 2003 flood, further river modelling was completed to re-examine any impacts from the Jubilee River on downstream communities. ""The results showed that there would be very little difference."" Mr Douglas said his workshop had been flooded four times in 20 years and water was now 10 inches deep. He said when the flooding subsided, he would be left with oil, sewage, water and filth. In Runnymede, the A308 between Egham and Windsor plus the Magna Carta meadow flooded. Michelle Maxwell-Roberts, who waded through waist-high water on the A308 to drop her children at school, told BBC Radio Surrey: ""We've been at our house for 17 years. Luckily, [the water] has never come into the house. We're resilient."" Tom Gray, who also waded through water with his family on the A308, said: ""Walking is the only way now. I've known the river for 35 years, and this is the third time we've been through this."" Staff at the flooded 205-room Runnymede Hotel on the river bank were ferried by boat to the site earlier. In a statement, the hotel said: ""The safety and wellbeing of everyone at the hotel is our number one priority and steps have been taken to accommodate guests who've been impacted."" Surrey County Council previously said it was working with the Environment Agency and local councils to deliver the planned River Thames Scheme, with statutory consultation expected in early 2024. Residents have told the BBC the flood relief scheme has been repeatedly discussed since the 1990s but never implemented. Runnymede and Weybridge MP Ben Spencer said he had been pushing for the scheme to be implemented as soon as possible. ""It is the biggest scheme the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs have ever done,"" he said. In Chertsey, where the bridge is closed, residents said they were unable to get sandbags. Runnymede councillor Sam Jenkins said: ""We've made a small number of sandbags available at the council. These are finite in number. ""It is important to emphasise that, because the council strategy at the moment is to protect life over property. ""If the Thames is still rising and you feel that your property is unsafe, my advice is to call the council's emergency line."" Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

The application had been approved by the government, despite it twice being refused by the local Tory council and opposition from Mr Hunt.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Hunt said: ""I am bitterly disappointed to learn that the Court of Appeal has today refused permission for any further appeal against the UKOG planning consent for the Loxley gas well outside Dunsfold.

Jason Coyne, who worked for Preston-based Best Practice Plc at the time, was instructed to examine the computer system called Horizon in 2003. He said he notified the Post Office the data was ""unreliable"" but he was ignored, sacked, and then discredited. The Post Office said it was doing all it could to put right the wrongs. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses based on information from Horizon. It has since come to light the faulty software made it look like money was missing. Many maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues with Horizon, but some went to prison for false accounting and theft while others were financially ruined. After 20 years, campaigners won a legal battle to have their cases reconsidered. A public inquiry is ongoing but Mr Bates vs The Post Office - an ITV drama broadcast earlier this month - thrust the issue back into the spotlight. Mr Coyne - a digital forensic investigator at Evolution Project Consulting in Lancashire - said he was instructed by the Post Office as an independent expert to analyse data from the Cleveleys branch in Lancashire in 2003. He said there ""was clearly defective elements of its hardware, software and interfaces, and the majority of errors noticed in the fault logs could not be attributed to the sub-postmaster"". ""I also noticed that there was a number of concerning discrepancies within the audit logs,"" he told BBC Radio Lancashire. He flagged his concerns but he said the ""Post Office effectively sacked me and attempted to discredit the report internally"". The system was developed by the Japanese company Fujitsu for tasks like accounting and stocktaking. He said the Post Office then used their own internal and Fujitsu experts. In 2016, he was approached by Alan Bates, who was one of the main claimants who brought a case against the Post Office and went on to inspire the ITV drama. Mr Coyne was instructed as an expert witness in the case - this time for the other side - where he was cross-examined in court for four days. ""I had the truth, I had the data and had all the technology evidence to back up that data,"" he said. He said if his report had not been buried by the Post Office then the past 20 years ""might not have panned out in the same way"". ""I feel very sad that action wasn't taken back in 2003 because they had everything that they needed to be able to look at that,"" he said. ""We all know that computer systems will fail and it's how you deal with those failures. ""What the Post Office appeared to do is just simply not accept that fundamental fact that systems will fail rather than look at systematic problems and resolution. ""They just simply turned to say 'well the postmaster is responsible for this loss let's just pursue the postmaster' rather than look at the technology."" A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We share fully the aims of the public inquiry to get to the truth of what went wrong in the past and establish accountability. ""It's for the Inquiry to reach its own independent conclusions after consideration of all the evidence on the issues that it is examining. ""We are doing all we can to put right the wrongs of the past, including providing full and fair compensation for those affected and offers of more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 Postmasters, the majority of which are agreed and paid.

Mr Crozier was replaced by Dame Moya Greene who ran Royal Mail for eight years, during which time the company was privatised and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2013. Government ministers have promised a plan as soon as later this week to help hundreds of sub-postmasters clear their names. One idea being explored is passing a new law that would exonerate hundreds wrongfully convicted. In a statement, Ms Vennells, who was Post Office chief executive between 2012 and 2019, said she had ""listened"" to the sub-postmasters and others calling for her to return her CBE. ""I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system."" Ms Vennells has long faced questions over her role in the scandal, which has been described as one of the most widespread miscarriages of justice the UK has seen. While the scandal has been public knowledge for some time with a public inquiry ongoing, an ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which aired last week thrust the issue back into the spotlight. A public inquiry into the scandal has been under way since February 2021, and will resume on Thursday following a break over Christmas. Fujitsu - the Japanese technology company that manufactured the Horizon system - has been invited to answer questions from MPs next week. The Business and Trade Select Committee says Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake has confirmed he will attend the evidence session on 16 January. Ms Vennells was appointed as CBE for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office, which was launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. During her tenure, the Post Office repeatedly denied there were problems with the Horizon system. The Post Office said the honour was given for her work on ""diversity and inclusion"", and her ""commitment to the social purpose at the heart of the business and her dedication in putting the customer first"". However, despite the offer by Ms Vennells, the only person who can strip someone of an honour is King Charles. People can indicate they would like to renounce their honour, as Ms Vennells has now done - but doing so has no formal effect. Until the King is advised by the Forfeiture Committee and acts on its advice, Ms Vennells will continue to hold her CBE. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents 110,000 employees of Royal Mail (which Post Office used to be part of) said Ms Vennells' decision was ""a token gesture"". CWU's national officer Andy Furey also called for her to return performance-related bonuses she received during her role at Post Office. He said: ""Since she received these bonuses while overseeing the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history, it would only be right to return this money."" Many victims of the scandal are still fighting to have their convictions overturned or to secure full compensation after being forced to pay out thousands of pounds of their own money for shortfalls that were caused by Horizon accounting software. Jo Hamilton, a former subpostmistress who was wrongly convicted in 2008 of stealing thousands of pounds from a village shop in Hampshire, said she was glad Ms Vennells had agreed to return the honour. ""It's a shame it took just a million people to cripple her conscience,"" she said. Downing Street has said it is ""obviously the right decision"" for Ms Vennells to return her CBE. Former sub-postmaster Michael Rudkin, whose wife Susan was wrongly accused of stealing £44,000, said he was pleased that Ms Vennells had chosen to return her CBE. He said he had written personally to Ms Vennells after his wife's prosecution to ask for a further investigation into her case, and received no help. Mr Rudkin, who lost his job and union position due to the Horizon scandal, said his family had also lost friends due to the allegations. A CBE (Commander of the British Empire) is awarded to someone who has gone ""above and beyond for the community or country"". After a damehood or knighthood, it is the highest level of Order of the British Empire, and is followed by the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire), then the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire). Number 10 also said it would support ""further recognition"" of the work of sub-postmaster Alan Bates and others to expose the Horizon scandal. The government has been considering options to speed up justice for wrongfully convicted sub-postmasters. On Tuesday, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said the idea of using legislation to quash convictions of all Post Office workers caught up in the scandal was under ""active consideration"". Former minister Nadhim Zahawi has called for a ""simple bill"" to quash all the remaining convictions based on ""bad data"". However, others have disagreed, including former attorney general Dominic Grieve who told the BBC that it would amount to ""parliamentary interference in the judicial process"". Instead, he said each case ""ought to be considered on its own merits"", and sent to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates alleged miscarriages of justice. The scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history, but to date only 93 convictions have been overturned and of them, just 30 people have agreed ""full and final"" compensation settlements, meaning many victims are still fighting to clear their names. Some 54 cases have resulted in either a conviction being upheld, people being refused permission to appeal, or the person appealing having withdrawn from the process.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-67917518,Ex-Walsall postmistress says Post Office charges led to a breakdown,"A former postmistress says she suffered a mental breakdown after being wrongly accused of stealing £11,000 from the West Midlands branch she operated.",2024-01-09,"A former postmistress says she suffered a mental breakdown after being wrongly accused of stealing £11,000 from the West Midlands branch she operated. Jess Kaur was one of hundreds of sub postmasters to be accused or convicted of theft and fraud because of a faulty computer system called Horizon. Charges against her were dropped in 2009, but not before she attempted suicide and was sectioned in hospital. The Post Office said it was doing all it could to ""right the wrongs"". Ms Kaur ran Lazy Hill Post Office in Aldridge in Walsall, and discovered that she had been using a faulty pin pad on the system which took money out of people's accounts twice - but she was being accused of stealing the second amount. ""I didn't know what was going on until the auditors turned up at the post office and they said I needed to go with them to a police station,"" she told BBC WM. She said she told police she had done nothing wrong and during a break in her interview was told: 'You're the only one it's happened to, admit it, plead guilty and we'll get you back in your office the next day"". ""Then afterwards we did find out that it wasn't just me, it was a hell of a lot of other people it was happening to,"" she said. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and mistresses based on information from Horizon which made it look as though money was missing from their sites. On Monday evening, Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake told MPs that government will leave ""no stone unturned"" in seeking justice for convicted branch mangers. Mrs Kaur said she is yet to receive any compensation. The 36 charges of theft against her were thrown out by a judge on the basis of Post Office representatives conceding her pin pad was in fact faulty, she said. She sought no legal help when she was interviewed by police because she said she knew she was innocent although went on to plead guilty. She said did it because ""that's what they [police] told me"" and she could get back to work or if not, according to police, she would face further proceedings. ""I obviously got really scared. I didn't take any legal representative with me because I knew I was innocent. I hadn't done anything wrong,"" she said. But, she said the state of affairs overall became too much and she had a breakdown and attempted suicide at home before being admitted to hospital in Walsall for six months in 2011 for her mental health. After medication did not work, she received 14 treatments of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) which she said was successful, but ""did not work they way it should have done"" and led to childhood memory loss. ""After that, I did try and commit suicide again when I was in hospital,"" she said adding that her family agreed she should have the treatment but later regretted the decision. She said the whole experience ""ruined"" her, but she was pleased that her story features in the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. ""Everybody's story is different. There's people that have died, people are still seriously ill and compensation and closure is just not coming to an end - we just want closure on everything and to carry on with our lives,"" she added. The Post Office said it was ""deeply sorry"" and offers of compensation totalling more than £130m have been made to date, the vast majority of which have been agreed and paid. ""We're continuing to make interim payments in other cases. We fully share the aims of the current public inquiry, set up to establish what went wrong in the past, and the accountability for it."" In a statement on Tuesday evening, Adam Crozier, CEO of Royal Mail Group between 2003 and early 2010, said he wanted to express ""heartfelt sympathies"" to those who were ""so wronged by the tragic miscarriages of justice and for whom justice has been denied so long"". He said while he had no involvement in the Horizon issue during his time with Royal Mail he felt ""deeply sorry"" for the lives that were ruined and stood ready to participate in the inquiry with the aim of making sure the ""tragic situation never happens again"".

Kieron Brockhouse, of Halesowen, near Dudley, had allegedly flown flags by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Prosecutors claimed he had breached the Terrorism Act in April 2021 and May 2022 by flying the flags at two houses. The 42-year-old was unanimously acquitted of two counts of supporting a proscribed organisation on Tuesday. The jury deliberated for two-and-a-half hours before clearing Brockhouse of both charges. During a five-day trial, the court heard how he had bought the UFF and UDA flags from a high street shop during a visit to Belfast. The organisations were proscribed as terrorist groups in 1973 and 1992 respectively. Giving evidence, Brockhouse told the court there was no malice behind flying the flags and posting pictures of them on social media. The trial heard Brockhouse, who said he was ""gobsmacked"" by his arrest in May 2022, had no intention of encouraging terrorism and believed the UFF and UDA had both ceased to exist after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Prosecutors at Birmingham Crown Court alleged he was reckless as to whether his actions in flying the flags and posting images on social media had encouraged others to support the organisations. But Brockhouse claimed he was copying the flying of flags he had seen displayed in Belfast, and that he had flown several flags at the address in Dudley to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Northern Ireland in 2021. His barrister, Gulam Ahmed, said Brockhouse thought both organisations no longer existed. ""If he didn't know they were proscribed, he simply could not be reckless,"" he said. Following the verdicts, Brockhouse said ""it's over"" towards those watching from the public gallery as he left the dock. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Freedom of information requests to museums and galleries which receive public funding asked for information on missing items from the last 20 years. It comes after British Museum member of staff was sacked after more than 2,000 artefacts disappeared. Other items missing include a Saddam Hussein calendar and a false moustache. The National Portrait Gallery, which reopened in 2023 following a three-year refurbishment, has 45 ""not located"" items - but insists they are not missing or stolen. Between 2007 and 2022, a drawing of Queen Victoria from 1869, a mid-19th Century engraving of King John granting the Magna Carta, a bronze sculpture of painter Thomas Stothard and a 1947 negative image of the wedding of the late Queen to the Duke of Edinburgh, were recorded as ""not found"". The gallery said it still needs to complete searches for items following a three-year refurbishment and items recorded as unlocated represent 0.02% of its collection, which houses 12,700 portraits and 164,000 images. ""The bulk of the items currently not located are photographic negatives and for the majority of those, the image has been digitally scanned and is available to the public as part of our online collections database,"" the museum said. Oil and watercolour paintings, a shadow puppet, false moustaches, various drawings, underpants, stockings and a mousetrap were among its more than 180 missing artefacts. No descriptions of the items or when they went missing were released and the Kensington design institution said it was ""standard practice to have a list of missing items as part of our regular auditing"". A V&A spokeswoman said the museum takes ""the protection of national collections very seriously and regularly reviews our security and collection management procedures"". ""This does not mean these objects have been stolen or lost, it might mean for example that a catalogue entry has not been updated after a collection move. Items are regularly recovered as a result of this process,"" they said. This group includes the National Maritime Museum, Queen's House, the Royal Observatory, Greenwich and Cutty Sark. About 245 items cannot be found, including a cannonball, a navigational aircraft computer, a gun-sighting telescope, charts, liquid compasses, an Act of Parliament, an Altazimuth circle (a mount for holding and rotating an instrument, such as telescopes) and ribbons and bands for caps. The museum said these could be ""ghost entries"" - the result of data transfer from more primitive databases: incorrect documentation or human error in the past. They have, however, re-discovered 560 items since 2008 through audits. A jaw fragment of a Late Triassic reptile, the Diphydontosaurus, was found to have been lost during a loan in 2019 - and the next year more than 180 fish were recorded as lost, and a crocodile tooth was discovered stolen in 2020. In the past three years, Cichlid fish were lost by researchers while on loan, 20 animal cells were destroyed from documentation not being presented while shipping a collection, and around 24 genomic tissues from octopi and birds were also lost when they were not properly refrigerated. Feathers, muscle, and liver from short-tailed shearwaters and fairy prions from Tasmania, Australia were also destroyed due to not being properly cooled and failing to be present for inspection. However, as these items were not catalogued, it is not clear how many samples were lost. A Natural History Museum spokesman said: ""We take the security of our collection very seriously, so over the last 20 years we've had just 23 instances of lost or missing items from a collection of 80 million, limited to small things like teeth, fish and frozen animal tissue. ""We have robust security measures in place which we regularly review. ""As a world-leading science centre, it's important that researchers from around the world have access to our collection to help find solutions to the planetary emergency."" The body includes the Science Museum in South Kensington, the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, the National Railway Museum in York, the Locomotion Museum in Shildon, Co Durham and the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford. In 2014, the group reported to police the theft of two model steam trains, a King George V and a British Railways Standard 4MT class. The museum also has recorded as missing a 1960s model of a deep-sea observation chamber, a diver's watertight torch, resuscitating apparatus and a 19th-century portrait of Joseph Marie Jacquard (who developed a programmable loom). The group, which houses 425,000 objects across its venues and centres, has begun putting barcodes on artefacts to track their locations and keep them safe. Seven artefacts, including a 1933 protective charm are missing from the Horniman, which has displays of anthropology, natural history and musical instruments, and is known for its large collection of taxidermy animals. It said it has ""reviewed"" security in light of thefts at the British Museum ""as a precautionary measure"". More than 550 objects, made up of ship camouflage drawings, British Army officer's private papers, a calendar with a photograph of former Iraq leader Saddam Hussein and currency notes, were disclosed by the Imperial War Museum when asked about missing items. A museum spokesman said the artefacts ""date from many years or even decades ago, long before our current collections management systems were put in place"" and ""are also typically low-value, mass-produced items"". It emerged in November that a 19th-Century cannon from the Royal Armouries collection was stolen from a remote and off-site location. It was claimed to be a metal theft, meaning the cannon was thought to have been taken for its scrap value, rather than stolen as a ""collection object"". A pair of mounted sword bayonets also disappeared while on loan from the museum. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Abingdon Road in Oxford was closed on Friday in the wake of Storm Henk. Fire crews are continuing to pump water from the remaining closed section between Old Abingdon Road and Weirs Lane, Oxfordshire County Council said. Local councillor Anna Railton said some homes in the area had suffered from a loss of electricity and water as well as sewage problems. In Abingdon, Larkmead School closed after the site became flooded, with remote learning in operation. Head teacher Jonathan Dennett said the boiler house was under 4ft (1.2m) of water, which had ""wiped out hot water and heating"". ""We lost electricity and we also lost internet across the school site,"" he explained, adding: ""It directly affects 30 classrooms, the canteen and support."" Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran spoke in Parliament about the school's plight and the lack of flood defences for the town. Minister for Water and Rural Growth Robbie Moore, who was answering questions from MPs about the impact of the storm, agreed to discuss the matter further with Ms Moran. The River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames closed its doors to the public because the high water levels made the entrance and car park inaccessible. ""At least we can say we have a truly interactive river experience these days,"" museum director Steve O'Connor joked. ""Thankfully the building itself is on stilts… but our car park is most certainly under water and undoubtedly there is damage there that we'll have to assess once the water recedes."" He said a ""major clean up operation"" would take place. Mr Saidy and his mother, Salimata Whyte, who live near the Abingdon Road in Oxford, have not been able to go back to work because they have been dealing with the aftermath of the flood. ""My mum came downstairs and she woke us up just to see the house flooding,"" Mr Saidy explained. ""We were trying to get the water out but the water was coming from the ground."" Ms Whyte added: ""There's water in the living room, the kitchen, my son's room… there's no electricity and heating in there. ""That's my headache for now - it's going to be a big job."" Anna Railton, councillor for Hinksey Park, said it had been ""pretty grim for that family and other families"". She added: ""There's been people without electricity, one household without mains water, there's been quite a lot of backed up drains, so it's been a very stressful time for a lot of residents indeed."" But she said ""neighbours and everybody else are rallying around and trying to help out where they can which has been really good to see"". She said the situation ""has, on the whole, been pretty well managed"" though she pointed to ""a few bumpy bits"", such as one of the bus operators ""not fully grasping the closure"" and needing to do a three-point-turn. Ms Railton said the White House pub was ""certainly full on Saturday night"" and that the Tesco had done ""an admirable job staying open despite being welly-only access for multiple days"". Oxfordshire County Council said the original decision to close Abingdon Road was taken for safety reasons. The authority also closed Clifton Hampden Bridge from Abingdon Road to Long Wittenham.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-67922072,Blue School in Somerset facing uncertainty over concrete issues,The fate of a secondary school building remains uncertain after 20 of its classrooms were closed because of safety issues.,2024-01-09,"The fate of a secondary school building remains uncertain after 20 of its classrooms were closed because of safety issues. A structural inspection at the Blue School in Wells, Somerset, carried out last summer found cracked concrete ceilings and floors. Since then, students have been learning remotely at home as most of the school building was declared unsafe. Experts are still assessing the building to see if it can be repaired. Years 7 and 8 were unable to use classes in the Kennion Building at the site due to significant cracking in the concrete between the floors. But parents have now been sent a letter by the school, telling them only one year group will have to learn remotely from next week because a portion of the building is safe to use. Changing rooms have been converted into temporary classrooms while structural assessments on the other part of the building continue. Maths teacher Emily Williams said making use of current facilities had enabled more children to return to school. ""As you can see we are in the languages department rather than our normal maths room. ""So the old changing room has become the new maths office. It's a little bit cluttered at the moment but we will sort that out. ""It's not ideal but we're making the best of it and we're working really hard to try to make sure that every child is still getting the education they deserve."" An initial investigation of Blue School's site was started after reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) was found at hundreds of schools around the country. Although no Raac was found, the structural investigation of the Kennion block at Blue School - built in the 1950s - uncovered a ""major problem"". A structural engineer found ""significant cracking"" amongst all of the concrete floors and was concerned about the design of the concrete flooring joists themselves. Head teacher Mark Woodlock said the future of the school building remains in doubt, but is hopeful that they can salvage something of the site. ""The structural investigations still haven't been completed, so we have those to look forward to in the next week or two. That will tell us something about the next phase. ""What the next few weeks will buy us is a bit more time to, again, play around further with what we've got available, see what other opportunities come up and see if we can do something different.

Ofsted inspectors said ""most children spoken to identified staff as being the best thing about the home"". The report comes after an assurance inspection of Vinney Green near Bristol, run by South Gloucestershire Council, in November 2023. A council spokesperson said: ""We recognise there is always more to do."" The newly-published findings show a marked improvement from a damning visit in April 2022 when the home was given the lowest rating of inadequate. At the time, Ofsted officials said children suffered ""unlawful, painful"" restraint and unjustified solitary confinement for up to three days. When they returned to carry out a full inspection a year later they upgraded the rating to good, and the latest visit suggested this had been maintained after the council accepted ""practices were happening which shouldn't have been"" and took immediate action. Although children at the home have been left ""distressed"" when supervisors confiscated items from their bedrooms without good reason, the report said they ""spoke about having positive relationships with staff who give them the support they need,"" said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). The report also said managers had introduced new processes to monitor the use of physical restraint, including a focus on ""the reporting and reviewing of incidents"". ""Since the last inspection, there have been some occasions when staff practice regarding physical restraint has been inappropriate, placing children at risk of harm,"" the report added. ""In these circumstances, managers acted quickly to protect children, referring these incidents to the relevant safeguarding authorities for investigation and providing children with additional support."" ""Nevertheless, the language that staff use to describe children's behaviour is often unhelpful and does not provide children with a meaningful account of their experiences."" A council spokesperson said: ""We recognise that there is always more to do and that improvement must be continuous. ""We note the recommendations made in the report and work is already well underway to take action on these.""

Ben Leonard, 16, dropped 200ft (61m) from Llandudno's Great Orme in August 2018 while on a two-day trip. Alex Jamieson, now 20, said the organisation never contacted him about it in the intervening years. Scout leaders have already accepted responsibility for Ben's death. An inquest in Manchester into the teen's death also heard the hike had been unplanned and no guidance given to scouts beforehand. Mr Jamieson was questioned by the lawyer for Ben's family about what happened after the incident in terms of contact with scouts. Bernard Richmond KC asked: ""Did anyone ask you what had happened?"" Mr Jamieson said: ""No."" Asked by the lawyer whether ""anyone from Scouts [contacted] you?"", Mr Jamieson replied: ""No."" ""No-one ever said anything to you, to ask about what was done or not done by the leaders?"", Mr Richmond asked. ""No,"" said Mr Jamieson. The former scout said he was ""angry"" about Ben's death, and said he agreed that it was was the fault of the three leaders on the hike. He said agreed that had they been told not to go near the rocks, they wouldn't have. Ben, from Stockport in Greater Manchester, had been with two friends when they walked away from the rest of the Explorer Scouts group to follow a different route. Mr Jamieson, who was one of the three, told the inquest they had made their way along the promenade and into the Happy Valley gardens at the bottom of the Orme. But he said they lost sight of the others - among whom were three scout leaders - and turned through a gate onto rockier, steeper terrain. He said they had ""explored the area"", which included ""a drop"" to the right down to a road and the sea. At this point Ben ""went down a little bit"" and shouted to them that he had seen a way down, but he and the other boy had ""opted not to go"". ""We said we'd see him down there and retraced our route down to the road,"" said Mr Jamieson, adding that by the time they got there Ben was being tended to by a member of the public who had witnessed his fall. Mr Jamieson agreed with Mr Richmond that the leaders had ""catastrophically failed"" to protect their charges. They had not been given a briefing in advance of the hike, nor a map or any warnings about where to go or what to avoid, he said. Scout leaders have already accepted responsibility for Ben's death. The plan had originally been for the scouts to climb Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, but it was called off due to bad weather. The inquest continues.","['Wales', 'Llandudno']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C814/production/_103202215_ben.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/103C4/production/_106800566_p01qd00d.jpg']","['Sarah Easedale', 'Nathan Bevan']",UK,England

An Arterio train carried South Western Railway (SWR) passengers between London Waterloo and Windsor for the first time on Tuesday. The high-capacity trains were initially due to run from December 2019 on SWR routes to Reading and Windsor in Berkshire. Software issues and the pandemic have been blamed for the four-year delay. Of the 90 Class 701 trains ordered, only 60 have been delivered so far, with only one in passenger service. SWR said it aims to introduce the remaining trains, which are built by Alstom in Derby, into passenger service within the next 12 to 18 months. For now, just one new train will run each day between London and Windsor, for four days as part of a trial. Stuart Meek, SWR's chief operating officer, said: ""We're very keen to get the full fleet into service as soon as possible, but we need to do that cautiously."" He added that the trains had to ""meet the standard in terms of customer service, safety and reliability"", and that ""the last thing we want to do is put a train into service and for it to break down on the tracks"". Mr Meek described Tuesday's journey as the ""next step on the journey"" to introducing the Arterio into full service. In December 2022, the Department for Transport stated the trains would be in service ""as soon as possible in 2023"". At the time, SWR said the delay was partly due to the impact of Covid-19. However, it acknowledged serious issues with the trains' software. The trains are intended to first run on Reading and Windsor lines, before extending to the entire SWR suburban network in south west London. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

It said bans on so-called zombie and cyclone knives were already in place ""and work is under way to extend this to include zombie-style machetes"". Zombie knives are defined as weapons that have ""a cutting edge, a serrated edge and images or words suggesting they are used for violence"". Mr Stephens has previously successfully campaigned for the Online Safety Bill, which aims to make the internet safer for children. ""We took on the Online Safety Bill and that's now law - not a lot of people know that, even Idris was surprised,"" he said. Mr Stephens added: ""What we want is to have cohesion, cooperation and to work together. ""If we can pull all this together we'll stand more of a chance of achieving something. ""There are many many people in our position that feel the need to do something. ""To have Idris spearhead this campaign was a god send really."" Olly had been lured by a 13-year-old girl to Bugs Bottom Field, near his Emmer Green home, before being stabbed by two 14-year-old boys he had been in dispute with on social media. Both boys were found guilty of murder, receiving custodial sentences of 13 and 12 years, while the girl admitted manslaughter and was sentenced to five years in custody. Elba, 51, is releasing a single, Knives Down, in support of his Don't Stop Your Future campaign. The track is about his frustration with the government for what he perceives as their inaction on knife crime.

One of the suspects in his murder had claimed to police that Miah had owed someone £500,000, the trial heard. ""If that is right, someone, somewhere, might well have wanted something done about that,"" Mr Aylett said. The court heard that after returning home on the evening of 19 November 2019, Miah received a series of telephone calls and texts. After telling his daughter he was going to the shops, Miah was then seen on CCTV getting into the back of a Honda Civic car parked nearby. Miah was in the car for about a minute and then went to the shops to buy some food for himself and his daughter. As he made his way home along Nelson Street, he passed a black Volkswagen Polo, and a CCTV camera caught the passenger door of that vehicle opening. ""The prosecution allege that in the time that the passenger was out of the car he had run towards Iron Miah and then shot him in the head,"" said Mr Aylett. ""This was, you might think, a most brutal execution - and one which appears to have involved a certain amount of planning."" One of men accused of the murder, Mohammed Ali, had ""tricked"" Miah into leaving his house by getting him to inspect something, most likely drugs, in the Honda Civic car, the trial heard. ""One consequence of such a ruse would be that anyone lying in wait to shoot Iron Miah dead would be able to get a good look at him,"" said Mr Aylett. At trial only one of the defendants, Ali, gave evidence. He accepted being present at the murder scene, but said he was only involved in setting up a drug deal. The court heard there had been two previous trials involving the three defendants. In 2021 a jury was unable to reach a verdict, while a retrial in October 2022 collapsed in ""remarkable circumstances"" after a witness was found to have provided false evidence. The latest trial started in November, with the jury returning verdicts after 16 hours of deliberations. Sentencing was adjourned until 16 January.

Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSG) said it could not participate in a process that was ""merely a political football between rival parties"". In December, Housing Secretary Michael Gove used his powers to review the rejection of planning permission by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Mr Khan said he was ""pro-business"" but that MSG had to ""play by the rules"". MSG had wanted to build its 21,000-capacity Sphere venue in Stratford. In a letter to the Planning Inspectorate, MSG said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that Londoners would ""not benefit from the Sphere's groundbreaking technology and the thousands of well-paying jobs it would have created"". The letter said: ""I write to confirm that we are officially withdrawing our application from the Planning Inspectorate process. ""After spending millions of pounds acquiring our site in Stratford and collaboratively engaging in a five-year planning process with numerous governmental bodies, including the local planning authority who approved our plans following careful review, we cannot continue to participate in a process that is merely a political football between rival parties."" A spokesperson for Sphere Entertainment, a sister firm to MSG, added that it was committed to working with ""forward-thinking cities around the world"" that were ""serious"" about bringing the project to their communities. MSG had planned to build its illuminated sphere venue in Stratford on a 4.7-acre (1.9 hectare) site that has sat empty since it was last used as a temporary coach park during the 2012 London Olympics. It would have had the highest-resolution LED screen in the world, along with immersive sound systems to host concerts, shows and sporting events. Mr Khan told BBC London: ""I saw the consequences to those residents if this globe was to be built, the impacts on them in relation to light, the impact in relation to their amenities and on planning grounds: I said no. But I welcome music venues in London."" He ruled in November that the Sphere would cause ""significant light intrusion"" to neighbours and could not be built.

Gordon Gault died in hospital six days after he was struck with a machete in Elswick, Newcastle, in November 2022, jurors have heard. Six people, now aged between 16 and 18, deny murder, and a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in relation to a 17-year-old boy. The jury at Newcastle Crown Court will continue deliberating on Wednesday. Two of the defendants, aged 16 and 17, are unable to be identified because of their age. The others, who are all 18, are: The fatal attack, which also saw the 17-year-old youth slashed in the back, came against a background of tit-for-tat violence between two groups who were looking for each other that night, jurors have been told. The trial started in November and was halted over the Christmas break. The jury had been told rap lyrics featuring the death of 14-year-old Gordon were found by police on some of the defendants' phones. Defendant Carlos Neto struck Gordon in a surprise attack, the court heard, having repeatedly talked about carrying out a stabbing on their rivals, the prosecution claimed. Mr Justice Martin Spencer outlined the prosecution case, saying: ""Carlos Neto carried out that intention, assisted and supported by five other members of his group who went on an armed mission to Elswick seeking revenge."" The judge said Mr Neto's case was that he was acting in self-defence and he reminded the jury of Jason Pitter KC's comment, defending, that what was said in rap or drill music was not necessarily true, just as Bob Marley and Eric Clapton had not really shot a sheriff. Other defendants claimed they were only in Elswick, in Newcastle's West End, to film a video for social media to show they were not scared of their rivals, the jury was told. The trial continues.

Mr Khan allocated £130m to the project in the 2023-24 financial year, which will rise to £140m for the next. He said he was ""thrilled to extend this lifeline for another year"". However, youth education charity Impetus said funding breakfast for disadvantaged pupils would have better targeted those most in need. City Hall says families will save ""up to £1,000 over the two years per child as they struggle with the cost-of-living crisis"". All children at state schools in England are entitled to free school lunches from reception up to Year 2. Year 3-6 pupils from households in receipt of eligible benefits are also entitled to free lunches under existing government rules. Mr Khan's scheme provides lunches for every other London pupil not already covered under government funding. He told BBC London announcing the scheme's continuation was one of his ""proudest days as the mayor"". ""I've spoken to teachers over the course of the last few months [and] I've seen the difference it makes in relation to better concentration, better attendance, better productivity,"" he said. The mayor said take-up of free school meals had been at 85% in the September to December term last year with 70 million free meals being served in London during that time. Asked why he had chosen not to invest the £140m in policing, Mr Khan said the government must ""play its part"" and provide additional funding. The scheme has been praised by campaigners including chefs Jamie Oliver and Tom Kerridge, but some organisations, such as Impetus, have said a universal approach could impact badly on the most deprived pupils. Currently, an application for free school meals triggers pupil premium funding, which is used to improve education outcomes for disadvantaged children. Impetus director Steve Haines said: ""We are concerned that the unintended consequence of this important intervention could end up disadvantaging the children who need it the most."" Susan Hall, the Conservative candidate for May's mayoral election, has previously said she would maintain the policy through to the 2024-25 school year, ""at a minimum"", if she was elected.

Keystone Homes Ltd is looking to convert Walsall's old Black Country Saddlery building into 11 flats. The application, called in earlier on grounds including fear of crime, has now been backed by council officers. But campaigners who are against it say there are already enough support facilities in the area. But the decision from officers to recommend it for approval comes after a Walsall Council document stated no objections from police or other statutory bodies. In the report to the authority's planning committee, which will meet on Monday, officers are recommending the scheme is given the green light. Two petitions, one carrying 145 signatures and another with 73, have been submitted against the proposal over the planned facility on Wednesbury Road. A total of 141 objections were put in to planners during consultation. Palfrey ward councillor Sabina Ditta, called in the application on grounds facility parking would be insufficient, a lack of details around waste, lack of privacy in neighbouring properties and fear of crime. Officers said there was ""no significant evidence that the proposal would increase crime and anti-social behaviour in the area or give rise to an unacceptable level of noise and disturbance"". They added the plan would not lead to ""a significant loss of amenity for adjoining neighbours"" and the application had sufficient off-street parking ""to meet policy requirements"". The facility would be run by Aspire Living, which said staff would be on-site round the clock to provide assistance. It added residents who fail to meet its standards are refused and also said it had a strict policy against housing ex-offenders or those with drug or alcohol addictions. Local residents, business owners, a mosque and two churches have campaigned against the facility, with support from ward councillors. Member Karl Moseley said: ""We already have the Glebe Centre, YMCA hostels, a Big Help hostel, a traveller transit site, drug rehabilitation centre, a probation centre and a domestic violence refuge, all within a one mile stretch of one another.""

More than 100 properties were flooded in Lincolnshire in the aftermath of Storm Henk, including 29 in Greatford near Stamford. Some residents said up to 1ft (0.30m) of water had entered their properties. Meanwhile, the owner of the Waterside Garden Centre near Bourne said it had lost more than £1m of stock. Greatford resident James Everitt said the village clean-up was going to take time. He told the BBC: ""We've seen the assessor and he's been very good. ""Our biggest problem is we've got to find alternative accommodation for up to six months because all of the walls are damp."" Last week, some residents in Greatford spent the night in a rest centre and others stayed with friends. Two people had to be rescued from their homes in the village by firefighters using a boat. Lois Webb, 79, one of those rescued, said she had lived in Greatford for more than 50 years and it was the first time her home had been flooded. Ms Webb said people in the village had rallied round to support those forced out of their homes. The community has also enlisted the services of a local security firm due to fears empty properties could be looted. Resident Nigel Ashby said: ""About a third of the village has empty properties and people are concerned."" Almost a month's worth of rain was believed to have fallen in the county in recent days as Storm Henk swept across the UK. Elsewhere, the Waterside Garden Centre near Bourne lost more than £1m of stock. Owner Andy Parrott said the water, which was up to 4ft (1.2m) in places, had caused a ""horrendous"" amount of damage. ""It is beyond belief,"" he said. ""We have nothing at the moment that works."" Part of Torksey Lock Caravan Park, 11 miles (17km) north-west of Lincoln, was also hit by floodwater. About 25 people had been forced to leave their homes. The Environment Agency previously said water levels in most parts of Lincolnshire were falling, but more than 100 properties had been flooded in the aftermath of Storm Henk.

William Francis was one of 17 people caught helping to pass drugs, phones and weapons to inmates at HMP Lindholme in South Yorkshire. He was jailed at Bradford Crown Court for 47 months after pleading guilty at an earlier in Sheffield. The gang was led by Amy Hatfield, a nursing assistant at the prison near Doncaster, and her inmate lover Joseph Whittingham. Hatfield was arrested as she arrived for work in October 2019 and officers found a variety of drugs and mobile phones in her possession. Whittingham was jailed for 11 years and Hatfield was handed a 10-year sentence after they were convicted at Sheffield Crown Court in October. The trial heard the gang included five Lindholme inmates, family members and friends. They were collectively sentenced to 88 years and 11 months in prison, with some receiving suspended sentences. Francis, 57, of Hogan Gardens in Nottingham, had admitted possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs and was sentenced on Tuesday. Police said he was linked to the group through financial records. Det Sgt Gareth Gent from South Yorkshire Police's Prison Anti-Corruption Unit said: ""The sentencing of William Francis today marks the end of our unprecedented four-year investigation into a highly complex criminal network operating inside HMP Lindholme.

Alpha Kalay, an inmate at HMP Hull, died on 19 January 2021. An inquest in Hull was told earlier treatment would have ""significantly increased"" his chances of survival. His daughter Melanie Kalay said he was clearly ill and staff had ""deprived him of his dignity"". The Ministry of Justice has been contacted for comment. Mr Kalay, who was born in Sierra Leone, was serving a four-and-a-half-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2019 following an ""altercation with a teenager in his garden"". According to the family's solicitor, Mr Kalay suffered from spinal nerve damage and had only 20% mobility in his legs. He also suffered from incontinence, and had a number of other underlying health conditions which made him clinically vulnerable to the Covid-19 virus. Towards the end of December 2020, Mr Kalay was placed in isolation after his wing buddy tested positive, and all care and support he was receiving stopped with no alternative care plan put in place, the inquest was told. The court heard there were various failures in terms of Mr Kalay's care after he presented as unwell, including a failure to recognise that a so-called ""dirty protest"" in his cell was actually a symptom of Covid-19. Ian Sprakes, Assistant Coroner for Hull and the East Riding, said Mr Kalay tested positive for the virus on 8 January 2021, but referrals were not acted upon. ""Healthcare involvement to assess Mr Kalay should have taken place on 12 and 13 January 2021. This did not occur and represented a significant missed opportunity to have assessed Mr Kalay's medical condition,"" he said. There was also a failure to inform and involve healthcare when it was considered that Mr Kalay was engaging in a ""dirty protest"", the coroner said. Giving a narrative conclusion, he said: ""This represented a further missed opportunity for Mr Kalay's medical condition to have been assessed."" Ruth Waters-Falk, from Hodge Jones & Allen Solicitors, said: ""Mr Kalay was an elderly man who was deprived of the most basic care and humanity whilst in prison at HMP Hull. ""Mr Kalay was patently ill for a number of days, and yet his symptoms were incongruously treated as a behavioural issue rather than the medical emergency which it so clearly was,"" she said. ""The prison's insistence that Mr Kalay was engaging in a dirty protest is shocking, and we hope that steps will be taken by the prison to ensure this doesn't happen again. ""The long list of failings outlined by the coroner reflects just how how badly Mr Kalay was let down."" Mr Kalay's daughter added: ""My dad was clearly very ill and it has been difficult to understand how prison and medical staff at the prison could have treated him in any way than other than as a poorly elderly man. ""They deprived him of his dignity and failed to keep him safe and well. ""Whilst I welcome the coroner's conclusion regarding the failings of the prison and healthcare staff, it does not change what happened to my dad and the inhumane way in which he was treated.

Violence broke out outside the Suites Hotel in Knowsley, which was providing temporary accommodation for asylum seekers, on 10 February last year. A large group had gathered and rocks and fireworks were thrown at police, Liverpool Crown Court heard. All eight defendants admit being at the protest but deny violent disorder. Det Con David Williams told the jury members of a right-wing and a left-wing group attended outside the hotel, which was providing temporary accommodation for asylum seekers, and at about 19:00 GMT a large group of people arrived at the scene on foot. He said: ""At that time it seemed that tensions changed somewhat."" Three police officers were injured as items including rocks, fireworks and paving slabs were thrown, with one needing hospital treatment, the court heard. A police carrier was ""totally destroyed"" in a fire and a number of other vehicles were smashed, causing £83,000 worth of damage, Det Con Williams said. He told the court there was ""ill feeling"" in the local area after a video appearing to show an asylum seeker from the hotel asking a 15-year-old girl for her phone number and for a kiss was shared on social media. Det Con Williams added: ""It was investigated and unfortunately a decision was made via the Crown Prosecution Service that no crime had been committed at that point."" Martyn Walsh, prosecuting, said defendant Brian McPadden, 61, of Kirkby, Merseyside, could be seen on body-worn camera footage pointing towards the hotel and could be heard saying: ""We protect our own, youse are not from Kirkby, we are."" Footage filmed through an officer's riot shield showed Mr McPadden, wearing black shorts and a black coat, standing in front of the burning police van. Mr Walsh said he could be heard saying: ""They better not leave that place in the next few days because they'll be dead. Every Friday we'll be here."" The court heard Thomas Mills, 47, of Kirkby, was seen standing on top of a police van holding a banner which said: ""Let's shout, get them out."" Mr Walsh said: ""The case against Mr Mills is he played an important role in the violence and is encouraging others to behave violently."" Paul Lafferty, 42, of Kirkby, was seen pointing towards police and shouting they were ""bullies"", the court heard. Mr Walsh said 21-year-old Jonjo O'Donoghue, of Liverpool city centre, was seen on footage lighting fireworks and firing them at police officers. Daniel Fulham, 39, of Kirkby, made his way through a police cordon with his Jack Russell dog, the court heard. Mr Walsh said: ""Mr Fulham picks up his dog, waves it and thrusts it towards police officers while shouting 'get them out'."" The jury was told Cheryl Nicholls, 44, of Kirkby, was seen shouting and gesturing to police while filming on her phone. Mr Walsh said she was heard calling men housed in the hotel paedophiles and said to police: ""I hope your kids are all proud of you."" Nicola Elliott, 52, of St Helens, was shown on footage shouting ""get them out"" and ""are you happy that they're raping our children"", the court heard. Jennifer Knox, 41, of Kirkby, was part of a group seen confronting police, Mr Walsh said. He added: ""The Crown say her conduct added to the threat of violence faced by police.""

But staff at Royal Stoke Hospital had still managed to see ""nearly 4,000 outpatients"", Dr Mark Poulson said. It comes as junior doctors ended six days of industrial action in an ongoing row over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) has called for a 35% pay increase to match rising costs and inflation. The government said it was not prepared to negotiate while strikes were ongoing. Dr Poulson, deputy medical director at University Hospitals North Midlands Trust, said the hospital had been ""busy everyday for quite a while."" He said the strike had required people to ""step up"" to work extra shifts to support staff. ""We've managed it because of everyone's hard work,"" he said. ""[It] has kept things moving and flowing and trying to make sure our patients are as well cared for and safe as possible."" Junior doctors in the region have denied compromising patient safety during the ongoing strikes over pay. Dr Shivam Sharma, of the BMA's West Midlands junior doctor committee, said ""15 years of underfunding of the NHS"" had meant patients were not receiving the care they need. ""The whole point of us being on strike is to make sure that we can relay our concerns but also we can maintain patient safety,"" he explained. ""Throughout the strikes, there's been so much data to suggest that there's been no compromise to patient safety while doctors are being on strike."" Dr Mark Anderson, medical director at Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust, said Sandwell General Hospital had been in a ""very pressurised situation"" between Christmas and New Year. He said the strikes, which took place in the busiest week for emergencies, had been disruptive and affected the hospital's routine care. ""We did come together as a team,"" he said.

Miss Hoffman, who has run the cafe in Belgrave Road since July, also appealed to those needing help. ""If you are feeling a bit down on your luck recently and you haven't really got a lot of spare money to your name to last you through to the end of the month, then we're saying 'you can come here, we're a safe place - come and grab a ticket off the wall',"" she said. ""We will prepare it free of charge, no judgment needed, because everyone deserves to have something to eat."" Miss Hoffman said they were also there to listen and did not want people to be alone.

At least three dogs were treated for symptoms including seizures, vomiting and diarrhoea, believed to be caused by something they ate on the beach in Hove, East Sussex. One owner said they believed their pet was going to die due to the severity of the symptoms. Brighton and Hove City Council (BHCC) said no evidence of pollution had been found. The incidents took place on the beach near Brunswick Square. Local residents raised concerns on social media and it was initially thought that palm oil, petrol or diesel could have washed up on the beach. Jack Duffy's two-year-old cocker spaniel, Ruby, was among the animals affected by the unknown substance after a walk on Friday morning. ""We'd got home from our morning walk and I was in a meeting with colleagues when I noticed Ruby start to jerk,"" said Mr Duffy. He called the emergency vet who told Mr Duffy to bring Ruby in. ""I couldn't get a taxi so I picked her up and sprinted to the vets which is about 10 minutes away,"" he said. ""Then in my arms she got really bad and I just started yelling. She made a noise almost like a scream. ""A man in a van nearby stopped to help me and I just thought she was going to die,"" he continued. Ruby was treated by MediVet Brighton, which said it had also treated two other dogs with similar symptoms. In a statement, BHCC said: ""On Saturday we were made aware of reports about dogs falling ill after being on Brighton beach in the general area of the Meeting Place café.“Our seafront team investigated the area and surrounding beaches and found no evidence of any forms of pollution.""No evidence of palm oil, petrol or diesel was found, the council said. BHCC said beach inspections would continue and advised dog owners to keep their dogs on leads to ensure they were not eating anything that could be a risk to them.

He later escaped into woodland and was tracked down by a police dog. Lucas-Parsons pleaded guilty to drug driving, dangerous driving and failing to stop for police. Wiltshire Police said Lucas-Parsons was spotted driving at speed, without lights on, through Pewsey High Street just after 04:30 BST on 8 May. Failing to stop for police when asked by a marked police vehicle, the force said a pursuit eventually took place. Lucas-Parsons eventually stopped the vehicle on Marlborough Road, where he attempted to abandon his car before getting back inside. An officer then fired a taser at him before he reversed at speed, crashing into a sign. The court heard that Lucas-Parsons then got out of the vehicle and ran towards woodland. Police Dog Conan was deployed to the scene and eventually tracked him down, with Lucas-Parsons admitting he was the driver. Lucas-Parsons was sentenced at Salisbury Magistrates Court to 24 weeks imprisonment suspended for 18 months, disqualified from driving for 18 months and ordered to carry out six months of drug rehabilitation. He must also pay a £154 surcharge and £85 to the Crown Prosecution Service.

Cameron Walsh, 16, and his father, Dave Walsh, 40, died on 6 January when the car they were travelling in went into a Lincolnshire waterway near Tetney Lock. Cameron, who played for Grimsby Town's academy side, and Mr Walsh were described by the League Two side as ""part of the family"". A friend of the teenager, Julian Otu, said everybody was ""distraught"". ""He was one of our best mates,"" he said. ""We went to school with him and used to play football with him and it was just a shock, I didn't believe it."" Meanwhile, Chase McCartney said Mr Walsh ""saw us all as his own kids"". ""He was one of those people, very welcoming, his whole family was very welcoming to us all,"" he said. Fin Goodfellow described the moment he learned of their deaths as ""the worst day of my life"". Grimsby Town Chief Executive Debbie Cook said ""Everybody at Grimsby Town is devastated by the loss of Cameron and Dave. ""Cameron was an integral, much loved part of our academy, and Cameron and Dave were very much part of the Grimsby Town family."" Tributes have also been paid from across the footballing world. Posting on X (formerly Twitter) the official FA Cup account issued a statement, saying: ""We're saddened to learn of the passing of Grimsby Town youth player, Cameron Walsh. ""Cameron was a bright young player who has been a vital part of Grimsby Town's FA Youth Cup campaign this season. ""Our thoughts go out to his family during this tragic time."" Several clubs, including Liverpool and Leeds United, have also posted tributes alongside Cameron's former club Cleethorpes Town, where the father and son had both been players. ""Dave was a popular footballer in the area, having played for the Owls at the beginning of our journey and then taking on the management of his son Cameron's side having many, many happy times,"" the club said. An online fundraiser for the family has raised almost £25,000. The car had been travelling along Tetney Lock Road, when it left the carriageway and became submerged in a waterway running alongside the road. Lincolnshire Police said the pair were both pronounced dead at the scene. Officers have appealed for witnesses and dashcam footage of the incident, which happened at about 13:30 GMT.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxwd1mrwl8wo,Council seeks tax rise of up to 21% over two years,N/A,2024-01-09,"Birmingham City Council has asked the government for permission to increase council tax by up to 10% each year for two financial years.If permission is granted it would mean a total potential 21% overall increase for residents by April 2025.That would be equivalent to £400 a year on a Band D property’s bill.The exact rise will not be agreed until the council sets its budget in February, and will be affected by separate charges for police and fire. Councils legally have to hold a referendum to increase tax beyond a 4.99% cap – but the government is currently considering a special request from Birmingham to waive that condition after the Labour-run authority effectively declared bankruptcy by issuing a section 114 notice in September.The council needs to save £300m over the next two years and its financial challenges have been compounded by a £760m equal pay bill and an £80m overspend on an IT project.Birmingham City Council’s leader, John Cotton, had said residents would only be asked for extra money if needed, and that could depend on what additional support was received from central Government.He told the BBC: “We have asked for a raise in the council tax limit that is not beyond 10%.“But, clearly, we’ve taken no final decision as yet on the raising of council tax.”He added: “We have asked for permission over two years, but clearly this is all dependent on the work that we are doing to balance the council’s budget.”A government decision on whether to allow the exceptional increase will be made before the city council sets its budget in February.Last month it was revealed children's services at the council would face cuts of £57m and the local authority's management budget reduced by 50%, raising fears over job losses.

Ral Pritchard was diagnosed with pigmentary glaucoma in June last year, with his vision reduced by 25% in one eye and 18% in the other. After being referred to Royal Stoke Eye Hospital, he was told the procedure could slow down the onset of blindness, but was yet to receive an appointment. The trust which runs the hospital said wait lists are prioritised by need. ""It's just so frustrating, at the end of the day it's your quality of life,"" the 69-year-old from Stone, Staffordshire said. Mr Pritchard was given the diagnosis by his local optician and two weeks later spoke to a hospital consultant and said he was told the operation was urgently needed. The retired property developer said he was told he faces losing his sight within a year if he did not undergo a trabeculectomy operation. Seven months on, despite several frantic calls and emails to the hospital, he has not been given a date for the procedure. With the operation, his sight could be preserved for 10 years, he said. The avid motorhome driver fears losing his driving licence and having to give up his much-loved hobby of exploring the UK and New Zealand, where his daughter lives. It comes as junior doctors come to the end of a six-day strike, the longest period of industrial action by NHS workers in its history. Mr Pritchard added: ""It's very annoying and frustrating. ""The strikes by the junior doctors are like a kick in the stomach, not just for me but for millions of people who are in pain, under mental anguish and fearing possible death due to whatever conditions or illnesses they have."" Ann-Marie Riley, chief nurse at University Hospitals North Midlands NHS Trust, said: ""We are very sorry to hear of Mr Pritchard's situation. ""All patients on our waiting lists are prioritised in accordance to need. ""However, if he is concerned, we would encourage him to speak to the Patient Advice and Liaison Team who can investigate and provide support."" The trust said cancer and most urgent operations and appointments have continued to be prioritised during industrial action and the ophthalmology team was on target to have treated all patients waiting longer than 65 weeks by the end of March 2024. The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors in the UK, has asked for a 35% pay increase. Junior doctors received a pay rise averaging nearly 9% this financial year - and during talks at the end of last year, the option of an extra 3% on top of that was discussed. But those talks ended in early December without a deal being reached. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-67921116,Penzance heated lido to close over winter due to rising costs,The UK's first geothermal lido has announced it will close for the remainder of winter as the system was not as efficient as expected.,2024-01-09,"The UK's first geothermal lido has announced it will close for the remainder of winter as the system was not as efficient as expected. The Jubilee Pool in Penzance, Cornwall, had been expected to remain open all year but it said it would only open in warmer months due to rising costs. The lido reopened with geothermal heating in 2020 as part of a £1.8m upgrade. But the operator said the pool was ""extremely expensive to run"". The facility uses underground heat to keep the sea water pool between 30-35C, allowing it to open all year round. The heating works by extracting warm water from a geothermal well, then transferring that heat to the pool before ""re-injecting the cooler water back into the ground"". The upgrade was partly funded by a community public share offer, in which 1,400 people provided £540,000. The remainder of the funding came through a mix of loans and grants. However, its operator said an ""unprecedented increase in running costs"" including energy prices and last season's low visitor numbers meant its operating model was not financially sustainable. The lido will reopen between May and October 2024, with sea wall repairs and works to geothermal facilities to take place over winter. Nicola Murdoch, chief executive of the pool, said the geothermal system was ""not quite as efficient as we hoped it would be"". ""The risk that comes with using innovative technologies and being the first of its kind in the country is it is not necessarily going to work as it might look like it is going to on paper,"" she said. ""We need to top up some of the heat ourselves, but obviously the extreme hike in energy costs that's happened in the past 18 months are completely beyond our control. ""It's cost us more than we anticipated in terms of running costs so we needed to take a proactive approach to ensure our sustainability and the future of the pool. ""Combined with that inefficiency in the system, it is just extremely expensive to run."" She said the pool would ""reshape our business model"" to meet the ""challenging financial circumstances we must operate within"". ""We are committed to providing a sustainable community facility, and these actions are the best way of doing that,"" she added. Penzance mayor Stephen Reynolds said the winter closure was disappointing. ""It came as a bit of a surprise but I can understand the decision,"" he said.

Aged 19, Peter English, who lived in East Yorkshire, landed on Gold Beach after D-Day. He served with 65th Norfolk Yeomanry Anti Tank Regiment, later telling a local newspaper: ""It was a very difficult time, but I was not involved in any death or glory incidents. ""I just remember being shouted at and told to keep my head down."" Mr English died at his care home in Bridlington on 7 December. His daughter Joy Harrison told the BBC her father was ""always modest"" when describing his role in the allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France in June 1944. A proud Yorkshireman who ""called a spade a spade"", Mr English was also ""known for his geniality, his wicked sense of humour and his charm"", she said. In later life, Mr English enjoyed several visits to France and Holland with his fellow Normandy veterans. ""He was greatly moved by the warmth and gratitude, both young and old, on visits,"" said Ms Harrison. She said her father was ""immensely proud to wear his medals"", especially the Légion d'Honneur awarded to him in 2016. France awarded the honour to British veterans to recognise their roles in France and Europe's liberation in World War Two. Born in Beeston, Leeds, to parents Edward and Kathleen, Mr English enlisted into the Army two months after his 18th birthday in 1943. After landing in France, Mr English continued on through Belgium and Holland and eventually into Germany. A skilled linguist before the war, Mr English transferred to the Army's interpreters pool, based in Germany. He finished his military career as a warrant officer in 1947. In 1949, Mr English travelled to Ghana as a cocoa buyer for Cadbury, where he remained for three years until a severe case of malaria forced him to return to England. Mr English met his future wife Brenda Travis in 1952 at a Scarborough dance hall. They married in 1954 and were married for 66 years until her death in May 2020. After marrying, the couple moved to Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, where their daughter was born, followed a few years later by son Andrew. During this time, Mr English bought a static caravan in the East Yorkshire resort of Bridlington. A promotion with Cadbury prompted the family to move to Derbyshire, which is where second son Mark was born. The family later spent time in Nigeria and Malaysia, before returning to Derbyshire. Mr English took early retirement and he and his wife moved to Bridlington, where they would spend the rest of their lives. Besides his children, Mr English is survived by six grandchildren and five great grandchildren. Mr English's funeral, which included The Last Post and a minute's silence, was held on 4 January at East Riding Crematorium in Octon.

Five-month-old Layla has been in and out of hospital since being diagnosed not long after she was born. Her parents, from Leeds, hoped she would be given access to Kaftrio, which would help her live a more normal life. But a consultation has been held which could see NHS funding for the drug withdrawn because it costs too much. More than 10,000 people in the UK have cystic fibrosis, an inherited condition that causes sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system. Kaftrio significantly improves lung function, helping patients breathe more easily and enhancing their overall quality of life. In November, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published draft guidance which deemed the drug, which costs £200,000 per year for each patient, too expensive to be offered on the NHS. An update is expected later this month on whether the drug would remain available to new patients. Those already taking the drug will be able to continue regardless of the outcome. Mum Rula Samara-Sellers said she and husband Connor had not been able to sleep properly because of fears Layla would not be able to access the drug when she turned two. ""I appreciate it's draft guidance but to put a value on a child's life is unethical and inhumane,"" she said. ""From day one we were told that there is a medicine out there which will hopefully make life better when she's two and that's what we've been living for. ""But now to say sorry, she may not be able to have it is absolutely horrific. It's like being handed a death sentence."" Jemma Davidson, whose daughter Elliette, 12, also has cystic fibrosis, has backed calls for the drug to continue to be prescribed. She said her daughter's life had ""completely changed"" since taking Kaftrio and the thought of other patients not being able to access it was ""cruel"". Mrs Davidson, also from Leeds, said Elliette had gone from taking many tablets a day and using a nebuliser to just taking the one drug, Kaftrio. ""It's given her her life. She's gone from having a life expectancy of 32 to now having a normal one. It's fixed all the scarring on her lungs - her last CT scan was clear. ""I cannot imagine now not having this drug. Potentially taking it away from others is putting a price on a child's life."" NICE said it was ""liaising with key stakeholders to determine the most appropriate next steps and will provide an update later this month"".

Junior Ajose, 36, and Cheriff Tall, 21, were gunned down in Moss Side, Greater Manchester, on 21 June 2020. Despite a man previously being arrested on suspicion of murder, no-one has ever been charged over the shooting. The witnesses have now been identified from mobile phone footage, police said, stressing they are not connected to the murders but may have information. On the shooting's third anniversary Greater Manchester Police appealed for anyone with information to come forward offering a £50,000 reward. The force said they ""remain committed"" to the investigation and believe answers ""still lie within the community"" as 300-400 people were present at the time. The men, who did not know each other, were both shot in the head at the party off Caythorne Street shortly before 01:00 BST and died in hospital. Mr Tall's father Mousa has previously said his son's killer was ""hiding like a rat"". Det Ch Insp Neil Higginson said: ""I once again want to appeal to the public in Manchester, in particular to these five people as we believe they are witnesses to what happened on that night. ""I want to make it clear though they are not connected in any way to the murder of Cheriff and Junior."" He added: ""Over the three years since Cheriff and Junior's lives were taken in tragic and upsetting circumstances, we have reviewed hours of footage, carried out several warrants and spoken to several people about this incident, but more is still needed to bring justice to their families after they continue to suffer immense heartbreak.

The ambulance service workers were taking a patient from an address in Leicester when they were attacked in August. One of the paramedics has been unable to work since the incident due to the severity of her injuries. The dog's owner, Pradip Kumar Dayal, was jailed for 25 months at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said the dog had been locked away when the emergency workers first arrived, but was then allowed out and attacked them. Rebecca Dunn sustained serious injuries to her chest, shoulder, arm and legs requiring surgery. Several months later, she has still not been able to return to work. Her colleague Cerys Hughes was bitten on her arm and leg and a third paramedic Asha Patel suffered minor injuries. Describing the attack, Ms Dunn said: ""The dog clamped on to my arm and shook me like a rag doll. ""I remember thinking to myself 'stay on your feet or you're going to die'. ""Asha and I wrestled with that dog for what felt like an eternity until we finally managed to restrain it. ""It wasn't until I was on the ambulance afterwards, I realised the full extent of my injuries. ""My uniform was torn and blood-soaked. I was shaking through shock and the intensity of the pain hit me."" Kumar Dayal, of Martival, Leicester, pleaded guilty to three counts of being in charge of a dog which caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place. He also admitted assault by beating, damaging property and possessing a controlled drug of Class B. The 55-year-old has been disqualified from owning a dog indefinitely.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-67914836,Awaab Ishak: Plan to force landlords to tackle mouldy homes,Rogue social housing landlords could be forced to repair mouldy homes within 24 hours as part of government proposals after a toddler's death.,2024-01-09,"Rogue social housing landlords could be forced to repair mouldy homes within 24 hours as part of government proposals after a toddler's death. Campaigners have demanded reforms after two-year-old Awaab Ishak died from mould exposure at his Rochdale home in 2020. The proposals would see new time limits set for repairs to unsafe homes. Housing Secretary Michael Gove said the ""strong, robust action"" would help ""prevent tragedies"". Known as Awaab's Law, the proposed legal changes would force landlords in England to investigate issues within two weeks, and begin repairs within a further seven days. The two-year-old's father Faisal Abdullah said he hoped they would ""stop any other family going through the pain that we went through"". He urged landlords to ""listen to the concerns of tenants"" after the issues he repeatedly raised with Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) about the state of the family's home were ignored. Speaking at the time, Mr Abdullah, said he hoped those responsible would ""get the punishment they deserve"". Campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa said it was crucial the proposals had ""teeth"" and were properly enforced. Mr Gove said the toddler's death from a respiratory condition ""should never have happened"". Mr Gove said the family had shown ""courageous leadership, determination and dignity to champion these changes and now it's time for us to deliver"". Under the changes, any emergency work must be carried out within 24 hours, with those who fail to meet the new deadlines liable to be taken to court by tenants and ordered to pay compensation. Housing campaigner Mr Tweneboa said: ""Many families across the country are still living in homes with damp and mould, creating misery but more worryingly risks to their health and safety. ""I'm pleased to see Awaab's Law reach the consultation phase and hope that it goes far enough to prevent other families going through the tragedy Awaab's family have had to."" Landlords will also be expected to keep clear records for tenants to show they have made attempts to comply with the time limits. Meanwhile, the Mayor of Greater Manchester has announced a consultation on creating a new ""good landlords charter"" for the city. Andy Burnham told the Today programme: ""The charter needs to set clear standards, clear timetables for repairs to homes. ""It should be based on the principle that people's homes should not damage their physical or psychological health."" He said there were many landlords ""trying to do the right thing"" and the voluntary charter would see they are ""getting recognition for doing that, differentiating themselves from poor landlords because there's no way at the moment that landlords can do that, they're all tarred with the same brush"". Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the ""scale of the challenge can't be underestimated"" after research found 850,000 adults living with young children experience mould frequently this winter. He welcomed Mr Gove's proposals, but said they ""do nothing for the millions of people who live in cold, damp or mouldy conditions in the private rented sector."" Speaking to BBC North West Tonight, Mr Gove said the government was trying to improve private sector housing through standards set in the renters reform bill, adding he would ""look closely"" at how the ""good landlords charter"" would work in Greater Manchester. One mother told the BBC her family had been put up temporarily in a central Manchester flat after her three-year-old son was hospitalised seven times because of serious mould in their flat. Louis, from Middleton, Rochdale, developed chronic breathing problems while living in the property. His mother Amy said mould had spread from the skirting boards and walls to children's clothes, her mattress and pillows. ""We've been moved out to hotels three times, we're in an apartment now, but when I've been in a hotel he's never once been poorly, coughed, nothing,"" she said. ""We were back home a week and then he ended up in hospital. I know that's what the cause is."" The government announcement follows the passing of the Social Housing Act last year, a move set to give the social housing regulator stronger powers to tackle rogue landlords. An inquest in 2022 found Awaab died directly from a respiratory condition caused by exposure to mould - after his family's concerns were not acted upon. Speaking at the time, Coroner Joanne Kearsley said the housing association was not ""proactive"" and asked: ""How in the UK in 2020 does a two-year-old child die as a result of exposure to mould?""

Dru Marshall, 26, of Romsey, Hampshire, claimed to be a senior footman at Windsor Castle when he listed an ""antler walking stick"" for auction. He was found guilty of fraud by false representation after a trial at Southampton Magistrates' Court. He was fined £613 and handed a community order. Prosecutors said Marshall listed the walking stick for sale online a week after Queen Elizabeth II died in September 2022. In his eBay listing, Marshall said the Queen used the stick in her final years ""as she struggled with her mobility"", dishonestly claiming the money raised would go to Cancer Research UK. Bids reached £540 when he hastily closed the listing after discovering police were investigating the scam. He pleaded not guilty to fraud by false representation, at different times claiming the venture was not a scam but a joke made in bad taste and later a social experiment to see how much attention his post would receive. Computer evidence was used to show used Marshall's online search history illustrated his intent to defraud potential victims by finding the terms ""the Queen"" and ""how to delete an eBay listing"". Julie Macey, senior crown prosecutor for CPS Wessex, said: ""Dru Marshall used the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to try and hoodwink the public with a fake charity auction - fuelled by greed and a desire for attention.

Wiltshire Police said one of the children was not restrained and was standing in the footwell. Ali was jailed for 14 months at Swindon Crown Court on Friday. He admitted dangerous driving, possession of cannabis and failing to stop following a collision. The court was told how road policing officers were carrying out patrols as part of road safety campaign Project Zero when they saw a Volvo V70 being driven by Ali on Cricklade Road, with what appeared to be illegal window tints. A pursuit was authorised when Ali accelerated away after police signalled for him to pull over. Police said he then continued onto Chapel Street and into Gorse Hill, reaching speeds of up to 70mph in a 30mph zone, going through several sets of red traffic lights and eventually colliding with a stationary van. The pursuit eventually came to an end after Ali pulled into a pub cark park in Southbrook Road, where he ran from the vehicle and attempted to climb a fence. Three children under the age of five were then discovered in the rear seats of his car, with a fourth child found standing unrestrained in the footwell. Ali was also found in possession of cannabis.

Reedham Ferry offers the only means for cars and foot passengers to cross the River Yare between Great Yarmouth and the A47 at Norwich. The vessel, which was built in 1983, must be inspected, repaired and certificated every three years to obtain its operating licence. The owner says he hopes the repairs can be completed within five or six weeks. David Archer, who helped design the vessel with Oulton Broad boatbuilder Fred Newson, said on the Reedham Ferry website: ""The chain ferry will temporarily be leaving us for its refit in Oulton Broad. ""We fully appreciate this is a 'pain in the neck' for our regular customers not having the convenience of the ferry for a few weeks, but needs must. ""The chain ferry is 40 years old now, we need to take extra good care of her."" Trains cross the Yare at Reedham, but the nearest road bridges are on the A47 at Postwick, south of Norwich, and the Breydon Bridge at Yarmouth. The privately-run ferry is due to complete its last day of service on Tuesday. On Wednesday it will be detached from its chains and towed to the yard where she was built. Previously a vessel built in the 1950s was used and prior to that the vessel was hand-wound on winches and was described as a ""horse ferry"" because vehicles using it were horse-drawn.

It stopped taking passengers in December 2022 after damage was discovered to a retaining wall, owned by the town council. Dr Malvern Tipping, the railway's owner, said it passed a safety inspection on Friday and preparations are under way for journeys to resume. He said he was ""so relieved"" to be close to reopening. Works to repair a wall were completed in November at a cost of about £750,000. Bridgnorth Town Council has had to raise council tax after borrowing £500,000 to complete the work. The closure of the railway, which connects Low Town to High Town, also led to 14 redundancies and is believed to have affected businesses in the town over the last year. One of the oldest and steepest funicular railways in the UK, it has operated for more than 100 years and transports people 34m (111ft) down the cliffside. Mr Tipping said: ""We are now working towards opening February. ""We are still tweaking and getting things ready. ""There are a few things we want to do to get it right and ready for the public and make sure we are satisfied everything is running correctly."" The lower station, he said, has been affected by a sewage leak which needs to be resolved. He said former staff were ""biting at the bit"" to return to work.

Robert Wattam, 24, who was found guilty of manslaughter, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Speaking after sentencing, Det Supt Nikki Burnett of Humberside Police said: ""An altercation ensued between Jack, Kian Feve and Wattam, where Jack was subjected to a horrific attack, which sadly led to him sustaining a fatal stab wound. ""Making no attempt to help Jack, both Kian Feve and Wattam fled the scene leaving him for dead in the street. The unforgiveable actions of Kian Feve and Robert Wattam resulted in Jack, a 29-year-old man, losing his life.""

CCTV showed Kian Feve, of Southfield Road, Scunthorpe, and Wattam, of Broughton, fleeing the scene, said Ms Burnett. ""Further CCTV footage identified Kian Feve and Wattam entering a property on Haycroft Street in Grimsby, immediately after the stabbing took place, remaining there for a short period of time, before being collected by a vehicle,"" she said.

Michael Norris said the man who attacked him had been released early under the home detention curfew scheme. Mr Norris, of Wirral, Merseyside, said his release was an ""absolute travesty"". The government said releases under sentence were only permitted after full risk assessments of offenders. The early release scheme was changed in 2023, partly due to prison overcrowding, and now allows inmates guilty of certain crimes to be released six months early. Prisoners are risk assessed before release and are subject a number of conditions afterwards, including electronic surveillance and residence at an approved address. Mr Norris's attacker was jailed for 28 months February 2023 and would have previously expected to serve half of that before being eligible for release, but the introduction of the changes meant he was released in the following October. He said his life was ""turned upside down"" after he was attacked by the man in a pub in September 2022 and his injuries have seen him undergo several operations and lose his job. ""To serve eight months for blinding somebody is an absolute travesty,"" he said. He said he believed those jailed should spend their sentence ""in prison and it should be a just amount of time"", adding that early release was ""just wrong"". He said that while the 10-year restraining order his attacker was subject to gave him some peace of mind, he wanted the government to take into account the impact violent crime has on the victims. ""I understand that prisons are full and that's one reason to be able to say that we need to let people out early, but... we should have enough prison spaces,"" he said. He said early releases put stress on victims and giving overcrowding as a reason was ""an excuse"". A Ministry of Justice representative said the attack had ""appalling consequences for Mr Norris and our sympathies remain with him"". ""Offenders are only released on home detention curfew following a thorough risk assessment and are subject to strict conditions including wearing an electronic tag,"" they said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpr3pz149y1o,Church 'needs full-time vicar' after three years,N/A,2024-01-09,"A fresh demand has been made for the appointment of a full-time vicar to a parish church that has been without a permanent minister for almost three years.St Thomas’ Church in Wednesfield, Wolverhampton, has not had a full-time vicar since Rev Nick Watson left in June 2021 to take up a post in Manchester. At present,  services at the church are being overseen by team minster Rev Tom Fish, from St Alban’s in Ashmore Park.Wednesfield North councillor Phil Bateman has written to The Bishop of Lichfield, Dr Michael Ipgrave, expressing the concerns of parishioners about the delay in appointing a new full-time vicar. Councillor Bateman said: “Not having such an important position within the church community filled can do a lot of damage to the church and the role it plays at the heart of the greater community. ""Not only is the spiritual offer diluted by no parish priest, but also the social role is very much weakened.""Councillor Bateman received a response from the Right Reverend Jonathan Clark, Acting Bishop of Wolverhampton, on behalf of Dr Ipgrave. Bishop Clark said that the diocese shared the councillor's frustration  and had worked with the parish to advertise the post five times, but had not received any applicants.“This is, I’m afraid, an extreme example of a problem across the whole church, where there are presently more posts available than there are priests to fill them,"" he said.""I can only agree with you about the negative effects of the absence of an incumbent, and I can assure you that the diocese remains committed to ministry in inner urban areas.“We remain hopeful the right person will be found to fill this post, and others which are, at the moment, without a priest. But it is becoming a more and more difficult process at the present time,” he said.Councillor Bateman added: “Since I wrote the initial letter I am surprised at the number of parish churches here in Wolverhampton that are also in the same situation in this city and its bordering Parishes, with no full time vicars.”This news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, external, X, external, and Instagram, external.

Prof Sir Roy died at the age of 93 of heart failure on Saturday.He carried out the UK's first successful liver transplant operation at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in 1968.Retired surgeon Prof John Wallwork, who is now chairman of Royal Papworth Hospital in the city,  said Sir Roy was one of the surgeons who ""put liver transplantation on the map"". Sir Roy and Prof Wallwork collaborated in December 1986 to perform the world’s first heart-lung and liver transplant, external at what was then called the  Papworth Hospital, based in Papworth Everard.Former consultant Prof Wallwork said: ""Roy Calne was one of the giants of transplantation. ""He began transplantation at a time when people didn't really know much about how to stop organs from being rejected."" ""Roy was very aware he was a pioneer,"" recalled Prof Wallwork.""Of course at that stage you can do new things more easily than you can now.""He had a very, very powerful personality and I think he obviously had to weather a lot of storms around him.""Without him and others doing liver transplantation, you wouldn't have transplantation as a routine way of treating people with liver failure."" Sir Roy was the first to use drugs to help stop the rejection of donated organs, leading to a major expansion of organ grafting worldwide.Several of the immunosuppressive drugs used today to help curb rejection, which can be a fatal complication, were introduced by him.""Roy was a giant in the transplant world and an innovative surgeon,"" said Prof Wallwork.""On behalf of Royal Papworth Hospital my thoughts and best wishes are with the Calne family.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0qd888p1wo,County council plans 5% tax increase from April,N/A,2024-01-09,"Council tax in Essex is to rise by 5% from April, the county council has said. The Conservative administration said it was doing so “reluctantly”, as it needed to make £32m savings, which would include changes to support for adults with disabilities.Last year, it increased council tax by 3.5%, choosing not to increase it by the maximum allowed by the government.Chancellor of Essex Chris Whitbread said there was ""a lot of additional pressure” this year and “a spike in the requirements in children’s services”. In October, Mr Whitbread said the council had “seen a significant and worrying increase in pressures” in children's services, with a projected overspend of £16.6m which had trebled in three months.""A lot of that has come from having much more complex packages to deliver than we have had before,"" he said. The 9.8% rise in the National Living Wage - from 1 April to £11.44 an hour - and social care inflation, will cost the council an extra £42m, the authority said.Mr Whitbread said there would be no cuts to services like libraries and family centres.The tax increase should raise an extra £40m a year from more than 500,000 households in Essex, but the council still needs to make £32m of savings.Nearly half of those will be met in adult social care, including a programme supporting adults with learning difficulties and autism. Lib Dem group leader Mike Mackrory is concerned about the funding gap in future years, which is due to rise to £120m by 2027-28.He told BBC Essex: ""It is a real concern what the impact will be on services and staffing levels.""Mr Mackrory also called for details on increased council fees and charges, which he says is forecast to raise an extra £18m, to be published.Labour's Ivan Henderson accused the council of “trying to cover up the cause of these financial problems"".He said: ""Millions of pounds have been taken away from local government. ""The government has let them down on the local finance settlement which is why people are having to pay more council tax."" Essex County Council hopes a planned £5m saving from a staffing review will be met in the coming year, but Mr Whitbread would not say how many full-time jobs would go.  It was not achievied in 2023.The road maintenance budget will fall from £46m to £39m in 2024-25, while footway maintenance funding will drop by 25% to £9m. The streetlighting budget is £7m next year, half of what it was in 2023-24, because of switching to LED lights and the falling energy price.Mr Whitbread said an additional £11m had been put into the capital programme for highways maintenance.

Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM) said the decision to evacuate those with additional needs in Wraysbury was taken on Monday night. Residents, whose homes have been most affected by floodwater, are being helped from their homes by firefighters and social care staff. The council said moving residents out of the village was ongoing. Those who have had to leave are being taken to safe alternative accommodation, the council said. A rest centre has also been set up at Windsor Leisure Centre for any residents who need somewhere warm and dry to go because of flooding in their homes. People who do not live in the village are being urged not travel through Wraysbury as many roads remain impassable and traffic has been ""causing issues for the flooding situation in the village"", the council said. Wraysbury Primary School has also been closed to keep pupils, parents and teachers safe during the flooding in the wider area. RBWM said: ""This decision was made on our recommendation, while we continue to respond with partners to this evolving situation."" Berkshire has been hit by severe flooding over the last few days, with several flood warnings currently in place. Carolyn Richardson, the emergency planning officer for West Berkshire Council, said : ""It's still serious across the area. ""Certainly the risk of new flooding is perhaps slowing down in the West Berkshire area and the rivers there are starting to stabilise and reduce. ""But in the east, in the Windsor and Maidenhead area, the levels of the Thames and Colnbrook are still very high as it's moving through - there are still significant issues with the rivers. ""We've experienced flooding in areas that we haven't in the past this year which is challenging.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-67914443,West Midlands floods: Defences 'not the answer for the future',"Flood defences are not the answer to future flooding, said a former Environment Agency (EA) worker.",2024-01-09,"Flood defences are not the answer to future flooding, said a former Environment Agency (EA) worker. In a thread on X, formerly Twitter, Dave Throup, who retired from the agency in 2021, said barriers would not be enough as climate change increased the frequency and ferocity of flooding. Instead, he said, there needed to be natural flood management measures along the entire stretch of rivers. The EA said it was developing a ""broad range"" of actions to tackle flooding. In his social media posts, Mr Throup said while many communities along the rivers Severn and Wye were protected by barriers, they were giving a ""false sense of security"". Floods, he said, were getting bigger due to a rapidly changing climate and, in 2020, every flood defence on the Severn and Wye had been within a metre of overtopping. With predictions showing ""very significant increases"" in river levels, he said there needed to be catchment-wide plans to use natural methods such as planting, ponds and bogs which can slow the flow of rivers. Reducing the severity of flooding by lowering out the flood peak as it passes along a river is known as attenuation, and works by spreading out the drainage of a river along its catchment. Mr Throup's comments were widely shared on X, including by journalist Caitlin Moran. Currently, Bewdley, Upton-on-Severn, Shrewsbury and Ironbridge have defences. Beales Corner, the opposite side of the current permanent defences in Bewdley, is getting its own permanent protection, with Severn Stoke in Worcestershire also getting its own barriers. However, the barriers have not been built quickly enough in Severn Stoke and its residents flooded again last week. Asked by BBC Hereford & Worcester about the delayed construction, Harriett Baldwin, West Worcestershire MP, said the project had planning permission and funding but was ""frustratingly"" delayed when the Environment Agency failed to come to an agreement with a contractor. The Tory MP said the scheme was a ""top priority"" for her, adding she would meet with the EA about the issue. ""It will get done. I will not give up. I have been working on this for 10 years. It will get done,"" she said. The EA said it had paused earthworks until the spring, pending the agreement of an affordable price with a supplier and that affordability of the scheme was a ""key challenge"" but it had not given up. In response to questions about future flood preparedness, the EA said: ""We work tirelessly to protect communities from the threat of flooding, maintaining approximately 76,000 flood assets across England. ""It is thanks to this work we have protected more than 75,000 properties from flooding caused by Storm Henk."" It said it was ""essential"" communities got ready for the impacts of climate change by becoming more resilient as a nation. ""That is why creating climate-resilient places lies at the heart of our flood strategy: ensuring we embrace a broad range of resilience actions to make us better prepared, such as £200m to test and develop new ways to create a nation resilient to flooding and coastal change,"" the EA added.

And sadly, she was murdered, with her mum, by her mum's boyfriend [on] the day he got out of prison. That really changed my life. ""At the time, after it happened, I remember thinking, 'Actually I'm coping with this really, really well'. Then, three months later, I looked like I'd had a stroke. My eye dropped and my arm went numb. ""I realised then that you have to have a reason for living - something that is going to make you want to get out of bed every morning - because I'd lost that. ""I couldn't get out of bed. I really was utterly broken by what had happened."" Art played a huge part in her recovery. Back in the 1990s, she had moved from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland to study metalwork at Camberwell Art College. After the tragedy, she decided it was time to return to her original passion. ""I realised that life was going by really, really quickly. I was 44 and I thought I need to get back to the things I love. The things that make me tick."" She started to draw small pictures at a desk in her bedroom every night. In 2013, she committed to her one-painting-a-day odyssey. ""It was never one drawing,"" she clarifies. ""It was like 10 or 20 and it just ignited this passion that I couldn't switch off. ""It became addictive and compulsive and normal. I just draw every single day.' The impact on her life has been huge. In 2016, she opened her first pop-up shop in Margate, using the name Margo in Margate because: ""It's great to have the freedom to be a different person. I'm Margo McDaid. I work as Margo in Margate and then anything is possible. I have so much freedom as an artist to do and be creative."" The following year marked a real turning point, when the Turner Contemporary art gallery in Margate started to sell her work in their shop. That institution is credited, along with the presence and work of Tracey Emin, as being crucial to the start of the regeneration of the town. Now many of the local independent stores hang and sell her work on their walls. Katie Barber of Albion stores, a fashion boutique, places Margo's canvases between their coats and collections. ""Lots of people come to visit Margate and have heard about Margo and will come to the shop to seek out the paintings,"" she explains. ""People that have a really nice sense of style and are looking to make their homes beautiful. We get those people coming in."" Round the corner in the beach-side gift shop Harbour & Tide, the owner Katy Lassen, is a huge fan of Margo's work and hangs a number of her swimming themed paintings around the store, even in the dressing room. ""We love her in here,"" she says. ""The inspiration behind the store was cold water swimming and sea swimming and also colourful, joyful products. So basically, Margo's paintings fit right in."" Across town, mega Margo fan Kara-Louise Ziebart shows us round her house, which has a Margo in Margate painting in every single room, bar one. Her love for Margo's art coincided with finding out that her mum had cancer. Kara explains that, after her mum died, ""having Margo's work in the house every day gave me confidence and strength to carry on. It really helped me to cope with my grief. ""There's hope confidence and strength, not only in the colours, but also in the messages that are written on them,"" she says, indicating a painting with the phrase Brave the Stormy Seas emblazoned on it. That one, she says, was a particular source of comfort. A two-hour drive along the south coast, in Brighton, Margo is applying the finishing touches to her new solo exhibition, which features 126 pictures of women. The 54-year-old, who is the mother of two boys, stands in the middle of the gallery and becomes emotional while surveying her work. ""To see everything together in one room, it's mind-blowing,"" she says. ""It comes from a place of genuine love and self-belief. I am really, really, genuinely proud of myself for working really hard, not giving up and believing in myself."" And with that, Margo in Margate whips out a brush from a portable painting kit that she carries, and starts to paint a line of women on the white corridor wall: ""I can't stop doing it, I love it so much,"" she laughs. ""So, I'm just going to to keep doing it."" Margo in Margate: Thinking of You, is on at Helm Gallery, Brighton until 18 February 2024","['Painting', 'Brighton', 'Art', 'Margate']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/AE83/production/_132257644_284fdecf-c06e-4751-86b7-a2d168896d1f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D593/production/_132257645_161b8549-f528-4778-8c13-a41b3991cfe1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/AE83/production/_132257644_284fdecf-c06e-4751-86b7-a2d168896d1f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/106B/production/_132230240_margoinmargatefan.jpg']",['Colin Paterson'],UK,England

Owner Daniel Horsley said Merlin does not have a history of running away.""He's like a magnet to me"", he said.But when the dog collapsed on the ground in the front garden, appearing to have a fit, he suddenly seemed to not recognise where he was and ran off.Mr Horsley and his wife Pam, from the village of Seaton, near Workington, West Cumbria, appealed for help online. They were especially concerned after seeing another post describing a dog walking around the village ""looking lost and not himself at all"".""A full search suddenly kicked in to gear,"" Mr Horsley added.Along with more than 100 people taking part on the ground, onlookers as far away as Australia and the United States watched the search unfold online. The son of one of Mr Horsley's friends sent up a drone to help find him.Meanwhile, another drone was brought in by strangers who had contacted Mr Horsley on social media to say they were on their way to the area and would keep him updated.West Cumbria search and rescue was also involved and used thermal imaging cameras.Mr Horsley said a local woman called and told him to go home and get some worn clothing,  as well as some of the contents of his vacuum cleaner to lay a trail back home.""If you think about it, it's the contents of your own home,"" he said, adding: ""It's the natural smells your dog's used to."" Just after 01:00 GMT the next morning, Mr Horsley said Merlin wandered up the drive of his home of his own accord.He said Merlin looked better than some of the people who had searched for him.""Apart from being soaked to the skin, there was not a scratch on him whatsoever after his 16-hour adventure,"" he said.""But some of the people [searching] on the day, with the undergrowth they were going through, were cut to bits.""Merlin was taken to the vet and given the all clear.His owners said they wanted to ""buy a pint"" for everyone involved in the search.""I can't thank them enough,"" Mr Horsley said.Meanwhile, a brewery in Seaton has offered to donate a keg of beer to Mr Horsley, for those who helped with the search.He said he hoped to organise an event soon, with the donated beer, to raise money for the charities involved in the search.

Ms Gray was diagnosed with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASLD) in 2010 and said the condition ""sneaks up on patients"".She said: ""Apart from fatigue and a constant discomfort in the upper right side of my abdomen, I was only aware of symptoms of my other conditions, not realising that my, so far undiagnosed, liver disease was progressing.""I am excited and relieved that this research offers hope of better diagnostic tests so people are identified sooner, and at the possible discovery of new treatments that could prevent cirrhosis, or even reverse it."" The study will focus on nonalcoholic or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (NASH/MASH), which is caused by a build-up of fat on the liver.NASH causes the formation of scar tissue which can cause the liver to stop working correctly, a condition known as cirrhosis, a university spokesman said.There are no approved medicines for cirrhosis and there is an urgent need for earlier diagnosis of the condition, he added. Professor Quentin Anstee, professor of experimental hepatology at Newcastle University, said: “We aim to work out why, even at the most advanced stages of liver disease, there is substantial variation in how the disease progresses with some people remaining well for many years whilst others rapidly experience liver failure or develop liver cancer."" The study will include 200 patients with cirrhosis, who will be recruited at specialist liver clinics across the UK and Europe.Patients will undergo a biopsy to collect a small sample of liver tissue and will then have regular blood tests and MRI scans performed over the next two years.Ms Gray said: ""I would encourage all liver patients to discuss getting involved in this innovative research with their own doctors.""

Conservative-run Hampshire County Council said it was under ""immense pressure"" to balance its budget by April 2025. It has proposed to reduce road repairs and gritting, switch off street lights for longer and reduce grant spending. Hampshire Cultural Trust (HCT), which has been warned of a £600,000 grant cut, said it may close five venues. It said it anticipated shutting Ashcroft Arts Centre and Westbury Manor Museum in Fareham by 2025 as well as making Eastleigh Museum's current closure permanent. Curtis Museum in Alton and Andover Museum and the Museum of the Iron Age would follow in 2026 unless further funding can be found, HCT said. It said it would also cease to operate Bursledon Windmill in March 2024 following the withdrawal of funding by Eastleigh Borough Council. Launching a consultation on planned service cuts on Monday, Hampshire County Council leader Rob Humby said ""tough decisions"" were needed to find the necessary savings. The authority said household waste sites at Alresford, Bishop's Waltham, Fair Oak, Hartley Wintney and Hayling Island were most at risk of closure. It said it planned to withdraw all funding for homelessness support services, which could result in the closure of emergency hostels. Street lights in some areas would be switched off from midnight until 05:00 GMT, instead of the current three-hour period of darkness. The council said it would also end funding for community transport schemes, bus services, some school crossing patrols and three adult social care grant schemes for organisations. It said 4,000 people would also be asked to pay more towards their home care. The authority's latest proposals would contribute about £17.5m towards the £132m savings target. Fareham Borough Council said it was disappointed at the impending closure of Westbury Manor Museum, which it said it paid £448,000 to refurbish in 2016. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-67909880,Rising River Thames floods Surrey homes and businesses,Homes and businesses have been flooded in Surrey amid rising water levels in the River Thames.,2024-01-09,"Homes and businesses have been flooded in Surrey amid rising water levels in the River Thames. Almost the entire Surrey stretch of the river is still at risk of bursting its banks, according to the Environment Agency map. There are currently 23 flood warnings in place in the county, 20 of which relate to the Thames. Runnymede Borough Council has set up a rest centre in Addlestone in case households need to be evacuated. The council said flooding conditions were likely to continue and while a major incident had not been declared, flood warnings were in place. Nick Moore, who lives next to the river at Runnymede, said he was standing in his garden in water up to his knees and about 20 other properties were similarly affected. He said he had to evacuate his mother from a cottage in his garden which was flooded with water that was ""full of sewage"". He said no-one from the council or Environment Agency had been out to see them. One of his neighbours, Dr Cameron Nichol, had been unable to get to work as a GP on Monday morning, after his property flooded. He said he, his wife, children and dog had to leave the property at about 05:30 GMT on Sunday. ""There is water in the garage and it is about to breech into my house,"" he said. ""I have had to move all my belongings [upstairs]. All of this could have been avoided."" He also said flood warnings were insufficient and flood management was poor. Chertsey resident Hannah Rush said her home was flooded and she had received no help. She said she contacted Runnymede Borough Council and asked for sandbags and was told they had none and she should phone 999, while Surrey County Council told her they could not help. Ms Rush, whose home was flooded when the Thames burst its banks in 2014, blamed the latest floods on the Environment Agency for opening flood gates on the Thames further upstream. She said: ""I have two cabins that are completely ruined. We are pumping it and stopping it from coming in the house. If it gets in the house it will be the same as it was in 2014."" In Staines-upon-Thames, resident Ian Swinglehurst said: ""Welcome to Staines-under-Thames."" He said: ""The river came up overnight. We narrowly escaped levels seen in 2014."" He said a flood relief scheme, the River Thames Scheme, that was supposed to protect the area, had been ""cancelled"". He said the scheme had been discussed repeatedly since the 1990s and never built. After communities were flooded in 2014, flood victims called for a reprofiling of the river bed, to speed up the flow and increase capacity, but he said this had not been done. Surrey County Council has previously said it was working with the Environment Agency and local borough councils to deliver The River Thames Scheme, with statutory consultation expected in early 2024. Following residents' criticisms, Surrey County Council leader Tim Oliver said the authority was supporting the Environment Agency and local district and borough councils to assist residents and businesses who were experiencing flooding. ""Our highways teams are also responding 24/7 to emergencies on the highway network,"" he said. The Environment Agency said teams remained out on the ground, ""working to minimise the effect of flooding where possible"". ""Recent heavy rain resulted in rivers levels running high across the South East,"" a spokesman said. ""We advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and urge them to not drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move a car."" Runnymede council leader Tom Gracey, said: ""I strongly encourage anyone who lives near the Thames or Bourne rivers or near flood plains to be flood ready. ""Check you have key documents to hand like insurance policies, move your car to higher ground if you believe you may be affected and think about where you could go if you do need to leave your home. ""Most importantly though, do not wait until your home floods before you act. If you think flooding is likely based on the physical conditions around you or past experience, contact the emergency services and prepare to evacuate."" He said frontline services had been reviewed, Meals at Home would continue and bin collections would continue unless roads were actually flooded. A rest centre has been set up in Addlestone if households need to be evacuated and a community transport service is ready to move people there, he said.

Tiff Needell objected to the proposal for the Grade II listed Glendore in Turnastone, Herefordshire, which was first used as a filling station in 1919. The ex-racing driver, who presented Top Gear between 1987 and 2001 before hosting Fifth Gear on Channel 5, called for the former petrol station to be preserved. The applicant said the historically significant part of the site would remain intact. In a written response to the planning application, Mr Needell said: “It should be a museum! Where’s the imagination? Not a home please! Madness!” He claimed the building’s historic features would “become just a token rather than living history” if the planning application was approved. As well as changing the site’s use to residential, the plans include repairing the existing outbuilding and constructing a detached garage. The site operated as a petrol station from 1919 until 2010, according to the application. At the time of its listing in 1998, external, it was thought to be the oldest surviving one in England.The period pumps still stand in the front garden and it was believed the adjoining house, unused for more than a decade, was 100 years older. Other objectors included motoring journalist Philip Porter, who claimed not to preserve “this unique motoring monument” would be “sacrilege”.“If it is a matter of money, I am confident that the funds can be raised and I would be prepared to lead such a crusade among our well-healed (sic) worldwide clients to preserve such a motoring shrine,” he added. A planning statement submitted on behalf of the applicant said Glendore needed significant repair and investment to survive and added the refurbishment would be sensitive.It went on to say that the principal façade, described as the primary part of the building’s significance, would be “preserved intact”.“It is concluded that the principle of the development is not only acceptable but that change is necessary to ensure long-term survival of the built heritage,” the statement added.

Shropshire Council refused proposals for the 22-megawatt site on agricultural land at Hall Lane, Kemberton in Shifnal. However, Vattenfall, the developers behind the project, appealed the local authority's decision from March 2023. A three-day public inquiry into the plans is set to start on Tuesday at Shirehall, Shrewsbury. Standing by the decision of its South Planning Committee, Shropshire Council said the development would have an ""unacceptably adverse impact"" on green belt land in the east of the county. The authority also said the loss of agricultural land for farming and rural enterprise was unacceptable. The original planning application attracted more than 120 objections. The site lies just inside the council boundary, but is less than half a mile from the border with Telford and Wrekin and the neighbouring Halesfield industrial estate. Swedish firm Vattenfall said the solar farm would generate enough electricity to power about 6,000 homes each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 5,280 tonnes annually. As part of the company's original application, it said the location was chosen due to a lack of available sites near national grid connections.

Senior councillors will discuss savings and investment plans at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The rise will come into force from April. It comes as the local authority tries to balance its books for the next 12 months and scrambles to find a way to tackle the forecast overspend of £22.2m for the whole of this financial year. The county council says it is facing underlying financial pressures in children's services, school transport and adult social care.

Fran Haddock, 33, said she had been forced to leave her job as a veterinary surgeon because she was constantly ""utterly exhausted"". She caught coronavirus in November 2022 and it developed into severe chronic fatigue syndrome. Ms Haddock told the BBC that before Covid-19 she had a ""busy and fulfilling life"". She had a mild form of chronic fatigue syndrome - or ME - before catching coronavirus but still managed to be ""super active"". Ms Haddock completed triathlons and was even training for a marathon. She said: ""I've been severely unwell and I'm not recovering. ""There is a common misconception that ME is just tiredness but it's only a fraction of the symptoms. ""Sometimes I cannot speak when I wake up and my partner leaves food in a pot and a flask of tea by the bed because I have to eat with my medication."" Her parents and partner are her carers and as well as taking daily medication she has to drink electrolytes and rest as much as possible. Ms Haddock had severe light, sound and screen intolerance for the first six months of long Covid and had to lie in a dark room for ""24 hours a day"". Meanwhile, Dr Alexis Gilbert, a public health worker in Wakefield has long Covid too and has been bedbound for the past 12 months. He said he was so weak he was only able to spend 20 minutes downstairs with his children on Christmas Day. The effort was so immense, he said, he then ""crashed for a week"" in pain. Dr Gilbert said he caught coronavirus in December 2022 but failed to recover before discovering he had ME. He said: ""I felt like a failure, I was devastated. ""It was physically painful to hug my wife and sons. ""I'm still adjusting."" Dr Gilbert said he has to ""budget his energy"" everyday and that means conserving his emotional energy, too. He added: ""I've gone from climbing mountains to not being able to feed or wash myself. ""The biggest struggle is that there is not a clear end and it isn't a disease we can treat.

The Green Party has put forward a motion to the council asking the Mayor to set up a task force to help tackle the housing shortage. The plans would see unviable office, retail or commercial sites being repurposed for homes. Councillor Tony Dyer, who proposed the motion, admitted the idea needed the input of developers to succeed. ""What we've had so far is very positive feedback from the developer community. It's not in their interest to have buildings that are empty. ""They would like to see return on their investment"". Mr Dyer, who is a Green councillor for Southville, said there was ""probably enough empty space in the city at the moment from retail to provide at least 300 flats, and that's likely to double to 600 by 2030"". According to government figures from October 2023, there were almost 400 council homes empty at any one time in Bristol between 2022 and 2023, while more than 5,000 properties, mostly in private ownership, stand vacant: nearly half of those for six months or more. ""We would like to see those buildings made use of so that they are a positive contribution to the city rather than being derelict. ""What we want to do is to work with the private sector to fund the task force to look into how we can bring these buildings back into use,"" he added. An estimated 3,200 people were homeless in Bristol last year with about 21,000 families on the housing waiting list, according to the homelessness charity Shelter. Mr Dyer said the city cannot afford to wait for central government to take action. ""Bristol City Council already has a small empty homes team which has been highlighted by the Local Government Association as an example of good practice,"" he said. ""Part of this motion seeks to expand their role and remit."" Councillor Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, will second the motion for a redundant buildings task force. She said: ""This motion demonstrates that there are measures that can be implemented right now to tackle the housing crisis and the climate crisis, both of which are important to the people of Bristol. ""Bringing existing buildings back into use as homes could save huge levels of carbon that would otherwise be released if buildings were demolished and rebuilt.""

Last year, a tribunal criticised Dr Robert Huey's conduct towards another vet. Dr Tamara Bronckaers was awarded a pay-out of £1.25m, after it ruled she had been constructively dismissed. The tribunal said Dr Huey had been ""intimidating, patronising, belittling and dismissive"". A job advertisement has been placed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), which says the chief veterinary officer post has an under-review salary range of £96,722 to £108,118. The department did not confirm whether Dr Huey is still in the role while the recruitment process continues, saying ""it is not appropriate to comment on individual employee matters"". It added that ""the recruitment process for Northern Ireland's next chief veterinary officer is under way and we would encourage those interested to apply"". Dr Bronckaers had raised concerns over the enforcement of traceability rules and animal welfare standards at livestock marts that were not acted on by her line manager or the chief veterinary officer. Dr Huey initially appealed the ruling, but later withdrew the challenge. In the wake of the tribunal, an internal review was established and a taskforce set up to implement its recommendations.","['Animal welfare', 'Agriculture', 'NI agriculture']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12D6E/production/_104866177_01letter4.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EF16/production/_124260216_tamarabronckaers.jpg']",['Louise Cullen'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67907205,"GP access could become as hard as seeing NHS dentist, doctor warns","Seeing a GP could become as difficult as accessing an NHS dentist, a County Antrim doctor has said.",2024-01-09,"Seeing a GP could become as difficult as accessing an NHS dentist, a County Antrim doctor has said. Larne Medical Practice is the 18th surgery in Northern Ireland to hand back its contract to the Department of Health. Dr Ian Lalsingh, one of the practice's five partners, told BBC News NI there were simply not enough of them to safely oversee its 8,500 patients. He said he was worried the GP system would ""collapse"". Unless the practice recruits at least one other GP partner, in May an alternative provider will step in - possibly the local health trust - which will supply GPs including locums. ""My worry is that general practice will collapse. That's my greatest worry - I see so many have handed back their contract and there will be more this year,"" Dr Lalsingh said. ""My biggest worry is that we would end up with a system that is similar to how the dentists operate now, that it's very difficult to get to see an NHS dentist."" In 2023, two surgeries in Larne merged to become the largest medical practice in the area. However, since then one GP has resigned which means there are too many patients for the remaining GPs to safely oversee. Handing back a contract is a last resort and, according to Dr Lalsingh, a move no one wants. He said the worry for any new service was that it would rely on"" stand-in doctors"". Dr Lalsingh said because these doctors would not be partners, he was concerned there would not be continuity of care and patients would see a different doctor every time. At 52, Dr Lalsingh said he had hoped at this stage in his career to continue being a partner in a thriving surgery. With no plans to retire, he hopes to be part of the solution but is realistic that finding other permanent GPs is unrealistic. Northern Ireland has 318 practices, 9% fewer than in 2014 despite a growing and aging population. While 18 practices have handed back their contracts to the Department of Health, another 100 practices are receiving ""rescue support"". When GPs operating a medical practice hand their contract back it means they no longer intend to run it. That may be due to issues such as retirement, staffing and recruitment problems or financial pressures facing the practice. The Department of Health will then attempt to find a new GP or a group of GPs to take over the running of the surgery. Northern Ireland has the second-highest number of GPs per 100,000 registered population in the UK - Scotland has the highest. General practice is fragile across the UK with issues including recruiting, retention, and funding familiar themes. Dr Margaret Black who is also a partner in the Larne Practice, said she felt privileged to be a community doctor. A GP for several decades, Dr Black is thinking of an exit plan but said she was not ready to go just yet. ""At the moment there's a lot of doom and gloom around general practice and I don't believe that's a true picture. ""Work-life balance is important but younger people view working differently now compared to older generations, "" she said. ""The thing about it is if more people did a little more it would be better,"" she said. According to the BMA's safe working guidelines, once GPs have seen their recommended number of consultations any other patients should be advised to attend the local emergency department instead. The recommended daily number for each GP is 25 consultations/patients. Dr Lalsingh said he and others were regularly exceeding that number, which was not safe for either the patient or the doctor. He explained that once his team reached capacity, they had no other option but to advise patients to use the ""Phone First"" service or go straight to hospital. The Department of Health said it recognised that GPs and their practice teams were continuing to work in ""increasingly challenging circumstances"". It said stabilisation of practices is a key concern. However, the department also said: ""The report of the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body published in July 2023 recommended a 6% uplift for independent general medical practitioners for 2023-24. ""Within the context of the department facing a funding deficit, it has not been possible to progress the DDRB recommendations for 2023-24."" It added that it had provided £3.4m in funding to meet winter pressure demand and £4.3m to assist GPs to deliver proactive support and care to those in nursing homes. In response to this, GPs said some of the funding was not new and did not meet increasing demand. A GP who introduced a new service offering private appointments alongside NHS work said its first week of operation had as not been without challenges, but he believed it was a sustainable system. Dr Tom Black described the ""hybrid"" model as a last resort to secure the future of Abbey Medical Practice in Londonderry, which caters for more than 6,000 patients. ""We are working hard to try to meet the needs of those patients,"" Dr Tom Black told BBC Radio Foyle's The North West Today.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67916306,Late barn owl brood in County Down causes surprise and shock,"A barn owl pair, considered to be one of Northern Ireland's most threatened farmland birds, have welcomed an ""extremely late"" winter brood.",2024-01-09,"A barn owl pair, considered to be one of Northern Ireland's most threatened farmland birds, have welcomed an ""extremely late"" winter brood. Four chicks were discovered at a nest in Ballycruttle Farm near Downpatrick, County Down in November. Conservation charity Ulster Wildlife said the brood was one of the latest recorded in Northern Ireland. Barn owl eggs are usually laid in April, with fledging beginning in June or July depending on the weather. However, the latest brood fledged - that is, learned to fly - in December, causing shock amongst conservationists. The barn owl is one of Northern Ireland's rarest birds and is red-listed on the Irish Birds of Conservation Concern and protected under the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985. There are fewer than 30 breeding pairs estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, which has made the discovery all the more exciting. Katy Bell, a senior conservation officer at Ulster Wildlife, said she ""couldn't believe"" it when she was sent an audio recording of the chicks snoring and rasping. ""A visit confirmed the exciting news, but our main concern was whether the chicks would survive given the extremely wet weather and floods,"" she said. Despite the fact barn owls struggle to hunt in wet conditions, Ms Bell added, the odds were in their favour as small mammals fleeing providing easy prey. The team returned a few weeks later and were ""ecstatic"" to bring in the four healthy chicks. ""This is the second consecutive year barn owls have bred at Ballycruttle Farm - a real testament to their wildlife-rich habitats and practices,"" Ms Bell added. However, the story behind the Ballycruttle brood is not too dissimilar to a typical soap opera plot. Last March, a clattering of jackdaws forced the female from her nest box to a nearby farm, managed by the Kelly family. The female and a nearby male, who had been hunting on the Kelly farm for many years, then bred and the pair had one chick late last summer. However, back in Ballycruttle, the male barn owl kept calling for the female to return. She eventually conceded, leaving the chick in the hands of the male who continued to feed it. With the pair reunited back in their original nest box, she then lay another clutch of eggs. Dawn Stocking of Ballycruttle Farm said the ""nail-biting"" story kept them on their toes. ""I was, of course, disappointed when the female jumped ship to my neighbour's fantastic farm and thought that we weren't going to see any chicks at Ballycruttle this year at all,"" she said. ""So, you can imagine my utter excitement when I heard babies snoring from the nest box - it was like Christmas had come early!"" Wildlife cameras were installed to catch the brood's antics, catching everything from wing stretches, small hops and even the chicks' first flights. ""It has been absolutely magical,"" Ms Stocking added. Both Ballycruttle Farm and Kelly's Farm are part of a project in County Down to halt and reserve the decline of barn owls led by RSPB NI. Michelle Duggan from the charity said it was a delight to see the work carried out by the nature-friendly farms yield positive results. ""The valuable seed-rich habitats maintained on both farms are an essential winter food source for the endangered yellowhammer, and also ideal hunting territory for barn owls to catch small mammal prey,"" she said. ""Healthy hedgerows combined with areas of rough grassland allow barn owls to expand their hunting territory even further."" The chicks have also been rigged to help identify and keep track of the birds' movement.","['RSPB', 'Wildlife', 'Owls', 'Conservation']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/90B5/production/_132254073_barnowlchickbeingweighed.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/105E5/production/_132254076_katybellulsterwildlifedawnstockingballycruttlefarm-michelledugganrspbni.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67914698,Daisy Hill hospital in Newry to permanently lose emergency general surgery,"Emergency general surgery will be permanently moved from Daisy Hill Hospital to Craigavon, the Department of Health has confirmed.",2024-01-09,"Emergency general surgery will be permanently moved from Daisy Hill Hospital to Craigavon, the Department of Health has confirmed. The surgery service was temporarily withdrawn from Daisy Hill in Newry at the end of February 2022. In September 2023, the Southern Health Trust had recommended it was moved permanently to Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh. The initial move was made due to surgeon recruitment challenges. The Southern Health Trust previously said the relocation was an interim measure. At the time, only two out of six general surgical consultant posts at the hospital had been filled, despite repeated recruitment processes. General surgery is performed by highly skilled surgeons who typically operate on common abdominal complaints including elective gall bladder surgery, hernia repairs and bowel repairs. The Southern Health Trust's recommendation to permanently move emergency general surgery to Craigavon came after a report on a 12-week public consultation on the future of the service in the area. The trust's medical director Dr Stephen Austin said, having trialled the approach for 18 months, delivering surgery from Craigavon was ""the only way we can maintain a safe and effective service"". However the decision has faced fierce opposition from communities in south Down and south Armagh. An average of three patients a day have been directed to Craigavon from Daisy Hill for emergency general surgery services, the Department of Health said. ""The department has concluded that the temporary arrangements demonstrated the merits of consolidation on a single site. It provided stability in clinical staffing, meaning safe services can be sustained in the longer term,"" a spokesperson added. The department's permanent secretary Peter May said the move ""reflects the reality that all hospitals cannot provide all services"". ""There has to be a level of consolidation and specialisation in light of advances in medicine,"" he said. ""Daisy Hill Hospital will continue to provide a vital service to the local community, across a range of key specialities."" Mr May said the struggle to recruit and retain consultant general surgeons at Daisy Hill was due to clinical factors, rather than a lack of effort. Emergency general surgery has also been temporarily withdrawn from the South West Acute Hospital (Swah) in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.","['Newry', 'NI Health']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5751/production/_128435322_gettyimages-1366551169.jpg'],['N/A'],UK,N.

The one-night-only show called Sinéad & Shane at Carnegie Hall will be a celebration of both their lives. Artists such as Mountain Goats, Cat Power, and Dropkick Murphys are set to cover a number of O'Connor and MacGowan's songs. Both Irish singers passed away in 2023. In 1995 they recorded a duet of Haunted together, a song previously released by The Pogues in 1986. It reached number 30 in the UK charts. O'Connor, known for being an activist as well as a singer, died aged 56 in July. She was best known for her single Nothing Compares 2 U, released in 1990, which reached number one and brought her worldwide fame. O'Connor, who was outspoken in her social and political views, released 10 studio albums between 1987 and 2014. In 1991, she was was named artist of the year by Rolling Stone magazine and took home the Brit Award for international female solo artist. In 2018 the Dublin singer converted to Islam and changed her name to Shuhada' Sadaqat, but continued to perform under her birth name. She released a memoir, Rememberings, in 2021. Irish President Michael D Higgins paid tribute to O'Connor when she died and praised her ""authenticity"" as well as her ""beautiful, unique voice"". He also praised Shane MacGowan as one of ""music's greatest lyricists"" following his death in November. The Pogues frontman died aged 65 after being diagnosed with encephalitis. The singer-songwriter, whose hits include 1987's Fairytale of New York and A Pair of Brown Eyes, had been unwell for some time. He also had well-documented problems with drugs and alcohol. Many of the artists performing at the concert had previously performed with O'Connor and MacGowan when they were alive. They include Glen Hansard, who performed a rendition of Fairytale of New York at MacGowan's funeral in December, and David Gray, Amanda Palmer and Gordon Gano. More acts are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.","['Music', 'Sinéad O’Connor']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7427/production/_132253792_gettyimages-85054475.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F8B8/production/_130527636_gettyimages-453119010copy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C80D/production/_131831215_gettyimages-540775342.jpg']",['Yasmin Rufo'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67889971,Aurora Bangor: Faulty pool hampers Paris 2024 Olympic training,"Athletes' livelihoods are ""at risk"" because of ongoing problems at Northern Ireland's only Olympic-standard pool, a leading swimming coach has said.",2024-01-09,"Athletes' livelihoods are ""at risk"" because of ongoing problems at Northern Ireland's only Olympic-standard pool, a leading swimming coach has said. Faults with mechanical pool floors have plagued the Aurora in Bangor, County Down, for three-and-a-half years. Diving has not been permitted since July 2020, when the floor of the 25m diving pool malfunctioned. A temporary fix for the 50m swimming pool was completed in late October, but it broke again in December. Aurora's owner, Ards and North Down Borough Council, said contractors would arrive on Tuesday ""to investigate the latest failure"". ""After this inspection has been completed, an estimated date of return for 50m swimming will be determined,"" it told BBC News NI. But Swim Ireland's head coach in Ulster, Kevin Anderson, said he ""can't depend on this facility"" to coach swimmers for the 2024 Olympic Games in August. ""I know the council are looking into the idea of replacing the floor altogether, but that's gonna take some time,"" he said. ""We don't have time to wait - our Olympic trials are in May."" He and others are calling for temporary changes to the configuration of Aurora's two biggest pools to give athletes the best chance to train. The floor of the main pool was designed to rise up and down so it can spilt into three sections of varying lengths and depths for different activities. The biggest issue is that swimmers cannot practice 50m lengths because a moveable floor got stuck in the pool's 25m format. ""Now, not only can we not train in a 50m-long course pool, but we can't even use starting blocks to dive off,"" Mr Anderson said. The coach argued competitors were ""treated as a second-class citizens"" because of the lack of Olympic-standard facilities in Northern Ireland. ""You're trying to get qualifying times just to make national teams,"" he explained. ""We're talking €20,000 (£17,000) a year of sport funding that helps them live and train and represent Ireland and Northern Ireland at the highest levels internationally. ""So you're putting these people in a great deal of risk. "" Mr Anderson has already booked pre-Olympic training trips to Spain and South Africa. ""I'm going to spend tens of thousands of pounds taking my athletes off the island so they're going get exposure to dependable long-course preparation,"" he said. Paralympian Barry McClements trains in Aurora for four hours a day, six days a week, in the hope of qualifying for the Paris games. The 21-year-old from Newtownards won Northern Ireland's first ever Commonwealth Games swimming medal last year. ""I train 06:30 to 08:30, and then again at 16:30 to 18:30 in the evening, and then I would sometimes have a gym session in between,"" he says. ""Unfortunately Bangor, it is a very good facility, but with the amount of breaks we don't get a lot of 50m training."" The swimmer competes in the S9 category due to having had one leg amputated above his knee. He came fifth at the 2023 World Para Swimming Championships and his coach believes he could get on the Paralympic podium this year. But due to floor faults, Mr McClements only had three weeks of 50m swimming this season before the latest malfunction. ""Long-course training is just better, you can feel that you're working harder,"" he said. ""You feel more confident to go into racing because you know you've been training this length of a pool just as much as anybody else. ""And when it breaks, it's frustrating and disappointing because you're losing all that training and mental strength."" The swimmer, his coach and others argue Aurora's main pool floor should be left at a fixed depth to allow athletes to train uninterrupted in a 50m facility. The council has a responsibility to provide a public pool, but Mr McClements points out Aurora has a separate 25-metre pool which could be used for leisure and swimming lessons. The second pool was designed to flexibly transform from a 4m-deep diving tank into a 2m-deep swimming pool. However, its floor mechanism got stuck in a shallow position in 2020 and the water is no longer deep enough to permit diving. ""Our diving programme is completely decimated,"" said former Diving Academy Northern Ireland coach Alan Cogan. ""We have lost a lot of talent to other sports."" Before the diving pool malfunctioned, his organisation was training about 150 people, including a squad of promising athletes who took part in competitions across the UK and Ireland. Three divers were earmarked for the ""Commonwealth pathway"" with hopes of qualifying for the prestigious games. ""Our last competition was in Aberdeen in 2019,"" Mr Cogan said. He explained the diving pool floor broke the day after his squad's first post-Covid diving session in July 2020 and has been out of action since. ""It's very frustrating,"" Mr Cogan added. ""Nobody's done it on purpose, but the whole process of getting it fixed is way, way too slow."" He also argues the ""wrong floor"" was chosen when Aurora was constructed and fears it could be years before it is replaced. The council confirmed it was ""in legal dispute with several companies concerning the floor system"" in addition to its long-term plan to replace the floor. It also said it was considering suggestions for fixed pool depths as a temporary measure, but warned this would ""likely have a detrimental impact on community use because it offers only deep waters suitable for confident swimmers"". ""That would result in a loss of access and service to the general public, significantly impact on the swimming lesson programme (which currently caters for more than 2,600 children) and lead to financial impacts that would be passed on to the council and ultimately the ratepayers."" It added: ""All parties are committed to continuing to work in partnership to find a long-term solution.""","['Ards and North Down Borough Council', 'Bangor', 'Newtownards']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/107DF/production/_132215576_nationalcentreulster.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/74C2/production/_132209892_aurorapool.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12BE7/production/_132257767_gettyimages-1242183259.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6C7F/production/_132257772_gettyimages-1235001684.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CD9B/production/_132253625_gettyimages-586078341.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C78/production/_125602967_aurorapool.jpg']",['Eimear Flanagan'],UK,N.

The controversial act became law in September, despite opposition from Dublin and all Northern Ireland's main political parties. Ireland is to dispute the law in the European Court of Human Rights. But Chris Heaton-Harris has again challenged Dublin on its record regarding legacy cases. In a letter to Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin, the Northern Ireland secretary also questioned the handling of prosecutions since 1998. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) confirmed to the PA news agency that a letter had been issued formally criticising the timing of the Irish government's decision during ""a delicate time"" in Northern Ireland amid efforts to restore power-sharing at Stormont. ""The secretary of state, in his letter, repeats his call for the Irish government to clarify the number of criminal prosecutions brought in Ireland since 1998 relating to Troubles-related cases, and presses the Irish government more widely to answer questions regarding its own record on tackling legacy issues in its own jurisdiction,"" the NIO said in a statement to PA. It is understood the British ambassador to Ireland issued the letter to the Irish government on Sunday. Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that Mr Martin was aware of the letter and would respond to Mr Heaton-Harris ""in due course"". ""At Stormont House, a collective way forward on legacy was agreed, along with most parties in Northern Ireland,"" a spokesperson said. ""This included the two governments signing an international agreement. ""Regrettably the British government decided on a different approach, unilaterally."" The spokesperson said compliance of the legislation with the European Convention on Human Rights would be ""tested by the European Court of Human Rights"". ""In the meantime, the two governments have much to work on together."" Aspects of the recently passed UK law include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests. Critics argued the law gave an amnesty and removed access to justice. In December Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his administration was left with ""no option"" but to legally challenge the UK government over the legacy act. He said the ""strong"" legal advice was that the UK Legacy Act breached the UN Convention on Human Rights. Reacting to Mr Heaton-Harris's letter, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he agreed with the NI secretary on the ""double standards"" of the Irish government on legacy. ""Whilst we opposed what the UK government are doing, and continue to oppose this amnesty that they have brought forward in their legacy proposals, we see the same approach taken by the Irish government, indeed over many years,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""As the secretary of state has pointed out, there have been no prosecutions by the Irish government, no attempt to prosecute those who were involved in terrorist activity in their jurisdiction."" In response, Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy has said people ""shouldn't be distracted by records"". ""Let's not kid ourselves that it's about the narrow ground of prosecutions, and who prosecuted who - this is about the British government effectively shutting down its role in the conflict,"" he told the programme. Fergus O'Dowd, a Fine Gael member of the Dáil (Irish Parliament), argued that the Irish government has been rigorous with regard to Troubles-related prosecutions. He also told Good Morning Ulster that the Irish government had ""no choice"" but to reluctantly take on a legal case to challenge the bill. Mr O'Dowd, who is the chairman of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, said both governments ""need to get closer together"" following Brexit. ""We want relations to get better,"" he said. ""But [the Irish government] have clearly defined objectives in relation to human rights and that's not going to change."" Victims and survivors have already taken action against the UK government at the High Court in Belfast, opposing the bill which Boris Johnson, then-prime minister, said in 2021 was to ""draw a line under the Troubles"". The 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland cost more than 3,500 lives and left thousands of people seriously injured. The legislation also brought an end to all new inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. Ireland's case is being taken under the European Convention on Human Rights. It's been almost three weeks since Dublin decided to push back legally and politically against London's legacy act. But diplomatic relations have taken a further dive as the UK's ambassador to Ireland, Paul Johnston, issued the letter to the Irish government. In it Chris Heaton-Harris again warned Micheál Martin that it's a ""delicate time"" in Northern Ireland while efforts to restore power-sharing at Stormont go on. And he challenged Dublin on its record regarding legacy cases and its handling of prosecutions since 1998. The Irish government has insisted its only option was to take the case, which could take years to conclude.","['Dublin', 'NI Brexit', 'The Troubles']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1E48/production/_132225770_960c2dc5e002e71d94d9588954cc96dad7aaa209.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6617/production/_115553162_soldiersrunfrombomb.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/149F8/production/_132227448_3a44f7b66b6c5101b17d4583e9ed566d9cb58cb7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9474/production/_118840083_jaynemccormack_tr_v2-nc.png']",['N/A'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67896399,Belfast City Council: Less severe cut for charity after row,A Belfast charity for children with special needs has had its proposed council funding increased after facing a potential cut of 97%.,2024-01-09,"A Belfast charity for children with special needs has had its proposed council funding increased after facing a potential cut of 97%. Sólás is set to receive about £308,000 for a building project following a decision on Monday night. It was originally earmarked for £800,000. However, there was a political row over proposals to reduce its allocation to £24,744 and share the rest among other community groups. Other parties on Belfast City Council branded the plan by Sinn Féin and DUP councillors a ""shameless carve-up"", but Sinn Féin said not all funding applicants can be successful. The issue was debated on Monday night at a meeting of Belfast City Council behind closed doors. A proposal to reinstate the original £800,000 was voted down. But a majority backed a DUP proposal to award £500,000 to both the Market Development Association and the Greater Village Regeneration Trust, and about £308,000 each to three other groups - Sólás, Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group (LORAG), and Fitzroy Presbyterian Church. The money is part of the council's £10m Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund, aimed at helping groups deliver capital projects in their communities. Two of the parents  with children who access Sólás services addressed Monday evening's council meeting. Jean, whose son has special needs, told the chamber Sólás had been a ""major turning point for her son,"" where he was able to make friends, go to summer and weekend clubs and be with ""people like him,"" and that it was vital for her family. Speaking before the meeting, Belfast's deputy lord mayor, Green Party councillor Áine Groogan, said the original proposals to reduce funding to £24,744 was ""utterly reprehensible"" and one of the worst political ""carve-ups"" she has witnessed on the council. ""A charity like Sólás is a lifeline for so many families and this was an opportunity for Belfast City Council to recognise that,"" she said. ""Instead, Sinn Féin/DUP have insulted them by saying it's only worthy of £24,000. They need to get their priorities straight."" Speaking after Monday's meeting, Alliance councillor Micky Murray he said he was disappointed that the debate on the funding decision for Sólás had been ""restricted to a closed session"". Twenty-one projects were shortlisted for neighbourhood regeneration funding, with £1.92m due for six schemes in south Belfast. Its area working group - a sub-committee made up of local councillors - recommended Sólás should be allocated £800,000 to develop a three-storey building and outdoor space for the charity. The rest of the funding was to be divided equally (£224,949 each) between the other five groups - the Market Development Association: Greater Village Regeneration Trust: Hearth Historic Buildings Trust: Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group (LORAG): and Fitzroy Presbyterian Church. But at a council committee in December, Sinn Féin and the DUP overturned the plan. Their councillors instead proposed more than doubling to £650,000 the funding allocated to both the Market Development Association and the Greater Village Regeneration Trust. The new plan also increased to £300,000 the funding earmarked for LORAG and Fitzroy Presbyterian Church. Originally Sólás had its funding cut to £24,744, while the Hearth Historic Buildings Trust - which wants to redevelop Riddel's Warehouse on Ann Street - had its share reduced to zero. Joan Henderson from Sólás said they were ""absolutely astounded"" by the initial proposal. She said it was ""an insult and an affront to children and young people with disabilities and their families"". ""It seems very, very strange to have been the priority project in the area, to then become the fifth priority,"" she said. ""Anybody looking at that, regardless of what background they come from, would say that just doesn't look right. That looks very unfair, and it feels very unfair."" Ms Henderson said if councillors were committed to ""equality and inclusion"", they would reinstate the £800,000 for Sólás and expand the funding available for other south Belfast projects. Speaking earlier, Sinn Féin said it ""supports and values the work of Sólás and the dozens of other groups in the city which applied for funding"". A party spokesman said applications to the fund totalled £49m but ""unfortunately not every group was going to be successful"". He said there was ""cross-party agreement"" at the council committee ""for 14 out of 15 projects from right across the city"". Emily Gallagher, whose son Oisin has been with Sólás  since 2009, said that there is ""nowhere else other than Sólás"" for her son and his peers to go. She told BBC NI's Talkback programme that the money was needed for a new building, as the organisation is currently operating out of temporary buildings that are ""not suitable"". Louise Conville, a former service-user at Sólás and the sister of a current service user, agreed that the new building was needed. ""I fear if this building that they're planning is not sorted out then there will not be that service for my younger brother who greatly needs it,"" she said. The Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund is aimed at projects to ""develop neighbourhood tourism, improve environmental sustainability and support the city's social economy"", according to the council's website. It said projects progressing to the third and final stage of the application process would look at procurement and detailed costings. ""Once this information has been received and carefully considered, councillors will make a final decision on which projects will go ahead under the fund,"" the council added. ""Construction is likely to begin on the successful projects from 2024 onwards.""","['Belfast City Council', 'Belfast South']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E968/production/_132225795_solas1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2A64/production/_132225801_ainegroogan1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11C94/production/_132225827_solas4-1.jpg']",['Brendan Hughes'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67910064,NI Weather: Air pollution warning due to cold weather,"High and moderate levels of air pollution are expected in Northern Ireland until Friday, due to the cold, settled weather and anticipated increased use of home heating.",2024-01-09,"High and moderate levels of air pollution are expected in Northern Ireland until Friday, due to the cold, settled weather and anticipated increased use of home heating. Temperatures fell to below -5C on Sunday night and are expected to do so again on Monday night. The chilly conditions have led to widespread frost and ice. But the cold and calm weather is expected to prevent emissions from home heating and transport to be dispersed. This has prompted the Department of Agriculture, Environment, and Rural Affairs (Daera) and the Department of Health to issue a 'High Air Pollution Alert'. Users of the Air Aware app received a text alert warning of the ""potential for isolated areas of high air pollution to occur"" . Those with respiratory and cardiac conditions are advised to be aware of their symptoms and get medical advice if they notice any change. Approximately two-thirds of Northern Ireland uses oil for home heating, which releases particles that may be inhaled. In the UK, most air pollution information services use the Air Quality Index and banding system approved by the Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollution. It uses an index between one and 10 to communicate information about air pollution levels in a simple way, similar to the pollen index. Air quality is based on five pollutants including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and other particles. On Monday, Strathfoyle, just outside Londonderry, had recorded high levels of pollution, registering at seven on a scale from 1-10. Moderate levels of five were recorded in Belfast city centre, Rosemount in Derry, and Newtownstewart. The cold weather caused disruption to some areas on Monday, with icy conditions on some roads. A yellow weather warning for ice was issued for large parts of counties Armagh and Down. Given the weak January sunshine and mostly calm conditions, the fog lingered all day across some areas of Northern Ireland on Sunday. A persistent fog bank formed in Belfast Lough which was observed by many people who were out walking in the surrounding hills. It was particularly noticeable as the bright yellow tops of Samson and Goliath poked through the top of the fog bank. The Harland and Wolff cranes are approximately 100m high and many of the Belfast hills are above this level. If you were at the top of Cavehill, Divis Mountain or the Holywood hills, you would be looking down on the fog bank with blue sky above. This phenomenon occurs from time to time when the weather situation is just right. An area of high pressure needs to be dominant with cold air trapped underneath, clear skies and calm conditions. This allows the fog to form in the first place and the area of high pressure overhead acts like a lid preventing the cold air underneath escaping. The cold air sinks into the bottom of the basin from the surrounding hills. A temperature inversion forms whereby the air above the fog layer is warmer than the air at the bottom. The fog becomes trapped because the January sun is too weak to burn the fog off from above and unless there is a change of wind direction, an increase in wind or drier air is fed in from somewhere else, the fog has nowhere to go. The temperature inversion will also trap pollutants near the ground and prevent them from mixing up through the atmosphere, thereby reducing the quality of the air surrounding us.",['N/A'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/548D/production/_132254612_mon7stephenhenderson.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A2AD/production/_132254614_mon1alistairhamillbelfastfog.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,N.

Mr Kerr, 54,  died after being shot during a robbery at a sorting office in the city, just months after the IRA ceasefire in 1994. The IRA later admitted that its members were involved in the killing. James Seamus Fox, 64, of Carewamean Road in Jonesborough is on trial for the murder. He is also charged with stealing £131,000, possession of a firearm and membership of a proscribed organisation. The Diplock no-jury trial, which is expected to last three weeks, began on Monday before Mr Justice Fowler. Craigavon Crown Court heard that the case had arisen following the 2019 re-examining of items recovered after the fatal robbery which highlighted DNA connections to Mr Fox. Giving an outline of the prosecution case, Samuel Magee KC said that on the morning of 10 November 1994 a routine delivery of cash arrived at Newry's postal sorting office on Clanrye Avenue at 9.05am. A total of more than £232,000 was delivered. Frank Kerr was counting this money in the Registered Letter Enclosure. At 9:45am, a post office van arrived at the gates. The court heard that a man dressed in post office uniform said ""priority services Belfast"". The van was allowed through the first gate. At this point, armed men tied up the security guard and his colleague in the security hut. The gang of at least four men were communicating by walkie talkies and they were all wearing post office-style clothing as well as make up, fake tan and glasses. The court heard at least two had firearms. Staff were detained at gunpoint. One of the gang made his way to the room Mr Kerr was working in and the court heard that Mr Kerr tried to force the man out of the room. A short time later he was shot through the neck. One of his colleagues was knocked unconscious.  When he awoke he called for help. By this stage the gang had escaped. Mr Kerr was transferred to hospital but was pronounced dead. It is the Crown's case that Mr Fox was one of the gang present. The court heard that at 10:40am on the day of Mr Kerr's shooting a Renault vehicle was seen by police on the Ballintemple Road beside Killeavy Castle in Meigh, seven miles from the murder scene. Police saw a car parked on the wrong side of the road and they blocked the road. A man got out of the car and ran towards Killeavy castle. Shots were fired by police but the man escaped. Two remaining males were apprehended from the vehicle. They were Declan McComish and Kevin Donegan who were later convicted for assisting an offender. The vehicle was searched and a post office uniform was found in the rear, on the floor. The prosecution said there were blood stains on the trousers, blood on the jacket and an anorak that had discharge residue. According to Mr Magee KC, this was ""a professionally-planned, high-risk raid by at least four people but with the help of others"". ""They had inside information,"" he continued. ""They were aware of a delivery and they were aware of the identity of some staff. They had at least two weapons. ""It matters not if the person fired the shot but that it can be proved that they were willingly present. ""Whoever wore that uniform was party to the enterprise. There is evidence the defendant wore those clothes."" This, Mr Magee said, related to the subsequent DNA analysis of tape lifts and clothing. The first witness was police photographer [Charles McAteer] who recorded both scenes on the day. Defence barrister John Kearney KC pressed the witness on what he recalled of the day. When asked if there was a potential that he may have moved items at the postal office,  he said, ""the only thing I touched was my camera"". The trial continues.",['Newry'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13AB/production/_108253050_archive1994_ld_0504.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15D5B/production/_132253498_fox.jpg']",['Cormac Campbell'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67913143,Gerry Kelly libel case against journalist thrown out,A court has thrown out a libel case brought by Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly.,2024-01-09,"A court has thrown out a libel case brought by Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly. Mr Kelly had sought damages over two radio interviews given by writer Malachi O'Doherty, in which he stated Mr Kelly had shot a prison officer during the Maze escape in 1983. The High Court in Belfast struck out Mr Kelly's case, describing it as ""scandalous, frivolous and vexatious"". Mr Kelly said the ruling, published on Monday, was a ""substantive judgement,"" which he would study with his lawyer. Mr Kelly was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze prison near Lisburn. During the break-out, prison officer John Adams was shot in the head. Mr Kelly has never admitted shooting him and was found not guilty at a trial in 1987. Mr Kelly had claimed Dr O'Doherty's comments, made in 2019, had gravely damaged his reputation and brought his standing as an MLA into disrepute. However, Dr O'Doherty pointed out that the prison officer had claimed Mr Kelly fired the shot. He also argued there was no damage to Mr Kelly's reputation, as he had served prison sentences for the 1973 Old Bailey bombings and he is someone publicly identified as a former IRA member. Mr Kelly has also written books which deal with the escape, although they conceal who fired the shot. In the ruling, Master Evan Bell stated: ""What Mr Kelly has written in his books, in my view, makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to rebut the argument that he was not a joint tortfeasor in respect of the battery. ""Even if one accepts Mr Kelly has not explicitly admitted pulling the trigger, the content of his books appears to make Mr Kelly civilly liable, on the balance of probabilities, for the shooting of Mr Adams. ""In the light of that, these defamation proceedings against Dr O'Doherty are completely untenable. ""For that reason the court strikes them out on the basis that they are scandalous, frivolous and vexatious."" The ruling went on to characterise Mr Kelly's case as what is known as a Slapp action - Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. It stated that on balance, the proceedings ""were initiated not for the genuine purposes of vindicating a reputation injured by defamatory statements, but rather for the purpose of stifling the voices of Mr Kelly's troublesome critics"". Speaking to the BBC's Evening Extra programme, Malachi O'Doherty said he did not know what the costs would have amounted to if he had lost the case, but he said the law of defamation was a ""high stakes"" business. ""I'm not a rich man.  I do own my house - I would have been liable potentially to lose my house,"" the freelance journalist said. ""The other possibility was that I would have lost all credibility as a journalist by conceding."" He welcomed the fact the court had recognised Mr Kelly's action as a so-called SLAPP case. ""The danger is that journalists may be wary of saying anything critical about Sinn Féin members because of the frequency with which writs are flying. ""I would urge people not to be intimidated."" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has also welcomed the ruling. Its assistant general secretary, Séamus Dooley, described it as ""extremely significant"" in the context of concern over the use of Slapp lawsuits against journalists. In a statement, Mr Dooley said Mr Kelly's case had no ""realistic prospect of success"" but yet ""the shadow of defamation proceedings has loomed over Malachi O'Doherty"" since 2020. ""Such threats have a chilling impact on journalists and journalism. The unambiguous language used in the determination should give those intent on using SLAPPs pause for thought,"" he added.",['N/A'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F41/production/_132252858_gettyimages-488147039-1.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1D65/production/_132252570_malachio'doherty02.jpg""]","[""Julian O'Neill""]",UK,N.

The ballot will run for six weeks and could result in a 24-hour walkout. A newly qualified doctor in Northern Ireland earns £26,000 per year: in England the starting rate is over £33,000, and in Scotland it is £32,000. The Republic of Ireland's pay grades operate differently, but junior doctors are paid a higher rate than their colleagues in Northern Ireland. In England, junior doctors started six days of strike action at 07:00 GMT on Wednesday in their dispute over pay. Northern Ireland's Department of Health has said there is ""no scope for a pay offer to be tabled for this year"". Dr Steven Montgomery, a paediatric junior doctor in the Southern Trust, called for ""pay parity, better working conditions and to save the NHS"". ""The main reason we need pay parity is so we stop haemorrhaging staff. We are losing staff to multiple countries, and these are highly skilled, qualified staff that we can't afford to lose,"" he said. ""As a junior doctor you just feel burnt out. The feeling among staff is that morale is low the lowest I have ever seen since I have been working in the health care system."" Northern Ireland Junior Doctor Chair (NIJDC) Dr Fiona Griffin said the ballot is unprecedented among junior doctors in Northern Ireland. ""Our health service cannot afford to lose these doctors, which is why we need to address the issues around pay urgently. This can be done with an immediate above-inflation pay rise and a commitment to full pay restoration in Northern Ireland,"" she said. Dr Griffin called for the government to engage with NIJDC as a ""matter of urgency"". She said failure to address pay in Northern Ireland now equates to a 30% reduction in 15 years. Dr Edwina Hegarty said ""no-one will listen"" to the concerns that junior doctors have about pay, leading to them leaving Northern Ireland ""in their droves"". ""The word 'junior' can be misleading"" she added. ""I am a junior doctor: I qualified in 2013 and I'm a senior registrar. ""I make life and death decisions daily."" Dr Montgomery, who works as a senior registrar at Craigavon Area Hospital, said Northern Ireland has lost too many doctors to other countries which means wards are struggling every day to meet demand, and not just at winter time. Originally from Limavady, he qualified in 2017. He said he was reluctant to leave Northern Ireland but wants a better work-life balance with his partner who also works in the health service. On average, he works 48 hours a week but realistically it works out at approximately 55 hours. ""Too few doctors mean it is a lot harder to get time off for annual leave even for things like weddings. ""I have friends who struggled to get their own wedding day off even though they let the department know 18-24 months before their wedding,"" Dr Montgomery said. Each year, Northern Ireland employs about 270 newly qualified doctors. In 2023, there were 20 jobs that became vacant because the doctors chose to work outside Northern Ireland. According to health unions, the ongoing negativity is having an impact on attracting younger people to the profession. A potential walk-out would impact on waiting lists and patients waiting to be seen on wards with consultants expected to cover junior doctor roles. The BMA has stressed that strike action is a last resort and it would welcome any approach from the Northern Ireland secretary to talk to them. The union warned that if there is no progress they would have to escalate action to longer strikes. In a statement, the Department of Health said it ""fully understands the scale of the frustration among health and care staff about pay"". ""Unfortunately, the 2023/24 health budget provided no scope for a pay offer to be tabled for this year,"" it added. ""We recognise that this is not a sustainable position and remain committed to pursuing all avenues to help achieve a resolution. ""The department respects the right of every individual to take industrial action. However, doing so at this time - with no route to a successful resolution currently available - would only further add to already severe pressures on services."" On Friday, the Royal College of Nursing announced it would be taking strike action, along with unions representing some other health sectors, on 18 January.","['Strike action', 'NI Health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16C58/production/_132227239_edwina.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6023/production/_132211642_gettyimages-1898443223.jpg']",['Marie-Louise Connolly'],UK,N.

Due to rising concerns over attacks and even deaths, the breed has been banned by the UK government in England and Wales. It will be illegal to own this type of dog south of the border from 1 February without an exemption certificate. On Tuesday Scotland's Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown told MSPs she was urgently reviewing the matter. And she advised potential owners: ""It would be preferable not to acquire any such dog at the present time in Scotland."" BBC Scotland News understands that a Scottish ban could be in force by the end of January. The Scottish Conservatives had pointed to widespread rehoming of the breed to Scotland since the change in legislation in England and Wales. And Jamie Greene MSP told Holyrood: ""I would not want to be the minster in charge of any policy who dithered and delayed a day longer than is necessary on this issue and another tragedy occurs."" The Scottish government had complained their UK counterparts had not kept them informed of the action they were taking. Ms Brown told MSPs: ""The unintended consequences of the UK government policy is that we're now seeing an influx of XL bully dogs coming into Scotland."" Last week a man claimed to have driven 30 dogs across the border for rehoming purposes. Under the new UK laws, XL bully owners must apply for a permit, take out insurance, neuter their dogs and pay a £92.40 fee by the end of the month in order to keep the animals. The breed has been linked to a series of attacks including the death of a man in Staffordshire. The campaign group Bully Watch, which was formed in response to a series of high-profile attacks by the dogs, previously accused the Scottish government and SSPCA of being ""asleep at the wheel"". And it called for action to be taken in Scotland ""before it is too late"". Under the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs definition, an XL bully has to be 20 inches in height if it is a male or 19 inches in height if it is a female.","['American Bully XL', 'Dog attacks', 'Dogs']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11602/production/_132207117_pa-74974230.jpg'],['Andrew Kerr'],UK,Scotland

Mrs Allan said she looked ""absolutely exhausted"" and she could see she had been crying. She said Ms Allan would usually put on a brave face but on this occasion she burst into tears. The inquiry at Falkirk Sheriff Court heard Ms Allan told her that there had been a huge fight and she wanted to be moved to another cell where it would be quieter. Mrs Allan said she spoke to a prison officer as she left the visit and told her what her daughter had said. When asked if speaking to the officer had given her some reassurance, she replied: ""I thought the prison officer was going to take action. It is the biggest regret of my life that I did not phone or refuse to leave."" After the visit, Mrs Allan wrote an email to Katie. In it she told her: ""You are loved, you have a home and a life to start rebuilding in a few weeks Katie, please hold onto that. ""Read your books and try really hard to zone out the noise. I know that won't be easy but try. When you don't react they will get fed up Love you, mum xx."" Mrs Allan told the inquiry her daughter had suffered from eczema since childhood and alopecia developed later. She said she noticed her eczema, which was triggered by stress and allergies, on her visit to her daughter just days after she was taken to Polmont. In the following weeks she said Ms Allan lost 60% of her hair. Mrs Allan, who had 38 years' experience in mental health as a nurse, said she also noticed a significant deterioration in her daughter's mental health. The FAI is also looking into the death of 16-year old William Brown, who was also known as William Lindsay. He took his own life in Polmont in October 2018. The joint inquiry previously heard he was remanded in custody after being deemed a ""potential risk to public safety"" three days before his death. Mr Brown, who had been in care repeatedly, was admitted to Polmont because there was no space in a children's secure unit. He had earlier walked into a police station with a knife while on bail for another blade offence. Despite a plea to bail him due to a lack of beds in a secure unit, Mr Brown was remanded to Polmont where he died in custody. The inquiry heard a statement from Mr Brown's half-brother John Reilly, in which he described the incident at the police station as an ""obvious cry for help"". Mr Reilly said he was utterly distraught when he heard Mr Brown had died. The statement added that Mr Reilly did not think people as young as his half-brother should be detained at institutions like Polmont and that he hoped the FAI would result in measures being put in place to ensure the practice changed. The inquiry continues.","['Polmont', 'Glasgow', 'Prisons']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5B52/production/_121887332_mediaitem120543963.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12E8/production/_90804840_7fb952c2-6523-4a24-a0c3-3a19f26f46b7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B789/production/_132258964_william.png']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

Andrew Flynn, from Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire, left his engineering job at Dyson and founded POTR to promote sustainable design.The pots are delivered flat-packed and a portion of the proceeds go to water charities.The 32-year-old said: “Our products are heavily inspired by origami, so being able to stock our products in the home country of the art form is a pinch-me moment."" After collecting and caring for houseplants over the years, Mr Flynn wanted to redesign the classic plant pot in a more sustainable way.He told BBC Scotland News that the POTR design is 100 times more carbon efficient than traditional plant pots.All the materials used are 100% recycled and the flat-pack pots can be delivered through a letterbox.""If you ship a concrete or ceramic pot to someone, you're essentially shipping a large and heavy volume of air,"" he said.""Those pots are fragile and need to be bubble-wrapped, so it's a really inefficient use of energy."" The POTR pots are primarily made of recycled polypropylene, a single-use plastic which would otherwise end up in landfill.""The material is only 0.5mm thick, the actual volume of material we use is 95% less than a traditional plant pot,"" he said.""Traditional pots need to be thicker as the materials are quite fragile, but we can use less.""He said the brand takes a ""holistic"" approach to sustainability in the face of it becoming a trendy buzzword.Mr Flynn said: ""Often companies will design a product and then think about how it can appear sustainable by making a small part of it eco-friendly. It's a bit of an afterthought.""But our aim is to consider it from day one.""The plant is elevated above a reservoir of water in the base of the pot and a length of cord is used to draw the water up from the reservoir and into the soil of the plant.This means plants could be left to self-regulate their watering needs for weeks. The brand launched using a crowdfunder in August 2021.It won Scottish EDGE a year later, the country's biggest business funding competition, which gave a cash injection of £100,000.The company started working with Scottish Development International after a series of Japanese importers and distributors showed interest in their origami pots.The company will officially launch its products in Japan on Saturday.Mr Flynn said the reaction in Japan had been ""incredibly positive"".""I think because the design is quite minimal it fits well with their design ethos and culture,"" he added.""After Japan, we're hoping to launch in the US by the end of next year.""He said the small team will expand from three members of staff to more than a dozen in the next 18 months.And the company hopes to develop systems which allow people to grow a ""daily harvest"" of nutritious food in their home.","['Sustainability', 'Milngavie']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5a39/live/6b2ddf20-aeeb-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/869/cpsprodpb/093b/live/6e3a2b00-a014-11ee-a7f8-09d017f00787.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/a3d5/live/d0d951b0-a013-11ee-8df3-1d2983d8814f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/0e5dc340-a014-11ee-8df3-1d2983d8814f.png']",['Katy Scott'],UK,Scotland

A Freedom of Information (FoI) request revealed the Crown Office was informed of possible issues in May 2013. Up to 100 cases north of the border are estimated to be affected. The news came as Justice Secretary Angela Constance told MSPs ministers were considering a scheme to pardon those wrongly convicted. She was later asked when the Scottish government was first informed about the scandal but told BBC Scotland News: ""I don't have that information to hand."" In Scotland the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) had sole responsibility for prosecuting Horizon cases, whereas in England the Post Office acted as prosecutor. Only two convictions in Scotland have been overturned so far. Susan Sinclair was found guilty of one charge of embezzlement in 2004 after a trial at Peterhead Sheriff Court. But her conviction was only overturned last year. Stuart Munro, who represented Ms Sinclair, said: ""Were other people prosecuted following that information becoming available? ""Ultimately, why has it taken until 2023 for the first convictions in Scotland to be overturned by the appeal court?"" The Crown Office said that they aimed to ensure ""all miscarriages of justice resulting from unreliable evidence obtained from the Horizon system are identified and overturned"". Deputy Crown Agent Kenny Donnelly said: ""COPFS estimates up to 100 Scottish cases may be affected. ""This is lower than in England and Wales due to COPFS policy decisions made in response to awareness of the Horizon system issues, and the fact that all cases in Scotland were prosecuted by the procurator fiscal under the application of Scots criminal law."" Kenny MacAskill, who was Scotland's justice secretary when the Crown Office first became aware of the possible problems, said that he had ""no recollections"" of any discussions with prosecutors or the Lord Advocate at the time. He told BBC Scotland News: ""In the ether people were aware of issues, but matters were still proceeding and it was, to some extent, under the radar. ""I'm sure Crown officials would not ever seek to prosecute somebody who they knew to be innocent but we need to be assured that they started to make inquiries [into the concerns]."" Mr MacAskill added that the scandal was ""shameful"" and that there had been a ""conspiracy to silence"" those affected. Dr Andrew Tickell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, told BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""The revelation that the Crown Office knew of problems is huge. ""Did they stop prosecuting? Did it occur to them that any of their cases before 2013 might now be unsafe because of these uncertainties? ""At the moment we know less about the Scottish dimensions of this scandal than we do about the rest of the UK."" Dr Tickell said Scotland was ""just at the beginning"" of addressing the miscarriage of justice, while England and Wales were ""much, much further down the road"". More than 700 people across the UK were convicted of crimes such as theft or embezzlement on the basis on information from a faulty IT system. Speaking in Holyrood, Ms Constance said she was seeking talks with the UK government about how best to pardon those affected while ensuring that they remain entitled to compensation. The justice secretary added that around 80 people in Scotland who may have been affected by the scandal have now been contacted by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC). So far 93 convictions have been overturned across the UK. And on Tuesday it was confirmed that Paula Vennells, who was in charge of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019, is to hand back her CBE ""with immediate effect"".",['Post Office Inquiry'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/107E6/production/_119485576_976_gettyimages-1005423606.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9F7A/production/_132262804_constance.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13A95/production/_117733508_macaskillparly.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D9A4/production/_132261755_tickell_sot_0901_frame_477.jpg']","['Katie Hunter', 'Jonathan Geddes']",UK,Scotland

His uncle Napoleon was one of history's greatest military commanders - winning battles across Europe - and emperor of France. His French army was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 by a coalition force, which included British, Dutch, German and Prussian soldiers. Napoleon surrendered and was exiled to St Helena, an island in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821. His nephew Louis Lucien was a philologist, a person who studies the history of languages.Prof O Maolalaigh said the prince was celebrated in Wales for his research on Welsh, but was almost unknown in Scotland.He toured Scotland in 1858, visiting his Gaelic and Scots language contacts. They included church ministers.Prof O Maolalaigh said the prince travelled incognito, the wider public unaware of who he was, and his tour took him to Skye and Shetland. In Inverness, Louis Lucien sought Gaelic translations of Biblical texts and later attended a sermon given by a Rev Archibald Clark in Kilmallie.Prof O Maolalaigh said: ""He was clearly interested in the sounds and acquiring some sort of fluency in the language.""He was a pioneer in putting emphasis on fieldwork and actually speaking to native speakers, and not just relying on the written word. He was ahead of his time.""I think that does deserve to be recorded in history.""The prince's fluency in Gaelic is not known, with some accounts claiming he was very fluent.""I think the truth is somewhere in the middle,"" said Prof O Maolalaigh.","['University of Glasgow', 'Perth', 'Inverness']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/539/cpsprodpb/0fc1/live/f2c53210-aed9-11ee-8be7-f3c2a886f170.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/939/cpsprodpb/96d5/live/c4edda00-af0a-11ee-a900-77f78f391636.jpg']",['Ruairidh Maciver'],UK,Scotland

Callum Strachan and his young family moved into the new-build property in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, a month ago. Building work was continuing on neighbouring properties until the firm went into administration on Monday, with the loss of more than 200 jobs. The construction business, based in the north-east of Scotland, said it had faced ""significant challenges"" since Covid. Mr Strachan, 27, said he had been left ""high and dry"" by the announcement. “I didn’t believe it,” he told BBC Scotland News of first hearing the news. “My granny phoned and I just thought ‘no, you’ve got to be joking’.“We’ve only just moved into a house a month ago, we haven’t got a garden, there’s repairs ongoing, I don’t know what to do.“Outside of our house is just a complete building site, it’s a fence and then ongoing works and stuff everywhere."" He said he feared for the safety of his young son and daughter on the Dunnottar Park development. “We have a three-year-old and a one-year-old, it’s not safe at all, somebody’s going to have to fix it,"" he added.“I don’t want to be living on a building site for the next year, two years, but who’s going to pick it up?”He said he felt “pretty confused” about the situation.“They haven’t communicated to me but I’ve attempted to get hold of them,” he said. Rodney Chan, 30, moved to Aberdeen from Hong Kong two years ago.He bought a home in Cove in October last year, but said that after just three days he noticed the patio door was leaking. Despite repairs being carried out by Stewart Milne Homes, Mr Chan said it happens again every time there is heavy rainfall.He was expecting someone to come and assess water damage on Tuesday, but said he received a call from the Stewart Milne sales office in the morning to say the visit was now cancelled. He is now concerned any future snagging issues will be left to him to fix and pay for. “I just feel stranded, with no-one to help,"" he said. ""I know NHBC (National House Building Council) can help, but it seems they only focus on structural problems. I just feel terrible, desperate for help and I don’t know who I can reach. “I just got an automatic reply (from the administrator) which said, you will need to reach NHBC and if they don’t cover then you will need to do it yourself then make an unsecured claim for the money. ""I don’t know who to turn to, I bought a house with such a high sum of money and now I don’t have any help.“Now it is the patio door, but later down the line, who can imagine?” Dylan Paris, speaking in Hamilton, said he had been a site labourer with Stewart Milne for about 10 years. He said: “We turned up to work just as usual then around about four o'clock there was an email sent out to the gaffers to basically get everyone into the offices to sit around and go into a Teams meeting and then from there we found out that we were all being made redundant.""So we just headed home basically. ""I loved working for the company, it was a good company to work for. So it’s devastating to see. It’s a sad end for Stewart Milne really."" He added: ""I’m panicking really. I need to get another job lined up as quick as possible so I can keep paying my bills basically."" The housebuilder's collapse came after an attempt to sell the company by its chairman Stewart Milne fell through last year.Administrator Teneo said 217 jobs would be affected.Hundreds of other sub-contractor roles also expected to be hit. Jane Wood, chief executive of Homes for Scotland, said she feared the situation could be repeated. She told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme she was “surprised” and “overall greatly saddened” by the Stewart Milne Homes news.“It’s a tough market out there,” she said. “Housebuilding is a complex sector and it has an extensive supply chain.""We are slightly concerned we’ll see more of this. It’s a worry."" The administrators said sub-contractors should not undertake more work for the business, and site access - to collect equipment for example - should not be attempted unless approved by the administrators.Teneo said the company was ""exploring options"" but was looking to work with other developers on the completion of unfinished sites.Buyers who have bought or reserved homes from Stewart Milne Group and have not yet moved in will be contacted by the administrators directly.Current residents with outstanding works are asked to contact the SMHomeowners@teneo.com for further information.The Unite union said it would explore possible legal action on behalf of members, in terms of a ""lack of consultation"". The business was started by former Aberdeen Football Club chairman Stewart Milne in 1975 after he qualified as an electrician.He postponed his retirement in an attempt to secure the future of the firm amid talks with ""seriously interested parties"".Mr Milne, 73, said: ""I am devastated by this totally unexpected outcome of the sale process and struggling to accept it, given the profound impact it will have on employees, sub-contractors, suppliers and customers.""Stewart Milne Group was up for sale and, following significant interest, two bids were submitted.

School had been tortuous. Bullied by other kids, he said the teachers didn't have time for him, so he sat at the back of the class. ""I couldn't read or write, I could just about write my name, I couldn't write my address at all,"" he said. He made it through by getting other people to read for him - mail, food labels, medicines. Since leaving school, Henry has made a living from gardening and landscaping, and has become an expert on plants. But as his parents got older, he realised he could not rely on them to help him read. Eighteen months ago he discovered an adult learning class in his home town of Motherwell. Nervously he went along, fully expecting - at the age of 49 - to be the oldest there. He wasn't. ""You're thinking you're the only one at that age, but when you get settled in, you get to know you're not the only one, there are a lot more,"" he said. It has been life-changing. ""I can do a lot more stuff in the house now, like my bills. Any letters that come in, I take my time and I can read it,"" Henry said. Going to the supermarket is easier too. ""I can go and pick a packet of beans or tomatoes or cucumber and read it,"" he added. Henry was what is known as ""functionally illiterate"". This is someone who can only read or write basic words like a name. Most can get by, but might struggle to understand a food label, medical prescription, menu or even a text message. The last Scottish government survey was in 2009 and put the number of people in Scotland who have problems with literacy at around 26%. Irene McGregor also left school unable to read and write. ""It affected me a lot, I had no confidence in myself, I couldn't even fill in a form. When someone asked me I'd just started shaking, started panicking, wee panic attacks"". At school one of her teachers called her a ""dunce"", saying ""you're stupid"". She was put into a class, in a corner, with a colouring book. Leaving at 16, Irene went to work at Boots. She loved it and longed for promotion. That never came - because of the lack of reading and writing skills. Irene, who lives in Airdrie, began learning to read in her 20s and now she can read a whole novel. More importantly she can read to her grandchildren. ""I'm actually sitting reading a book that I would never, ever do in a month of Sundays,"" she said. ""It helps you with your life, with your children, with your grandchildren, especially with all this new tech stuff"" Both Henry and Irene take part in North Lanarkshire Council's adult community learning classes. Irene is such a passionate advocate for adult learning, she runs classes in Airdrie. As for Henry, he recently learned he is dyslexic. His struggle to read and write makes sense but he wants people to know they are never too old to learn. Nicola Barlow, the council's community learning and development officer, said there was still a stigma to having low literacy skills. ""Even in 2023 people feel embarrassed,"" she said. ""For many adults they've lived their lives feeling that they've had lots of constrained opportunities. ""They can't apply for certain jobs, because of their limited skills, they can't support their children with their homework."" She said people who attend the classes realise that they did not have the opportunity to learn at school - whether it was because of illness, supporting their parents, or moving around. Lindsay Paterson, professor emeritus of education policy at the University of Edinburgh, was critical of the Scottish government's lack of up-to-date data on adult literacy. ""It [the Scottish government] has declined to take part in the respected international studies of literacy and numeracy and has declined to do that in over a decade. ""Other parts of the UK do take part, notably England and Northern Ireland. ""We should be doing that, we should be getting up-to-date global standard data to find out what's going on. ""However, from the most recent data we have, we can say the low levels of literacy and numeracy in Scotland are really quite concerning"". He said local authorities should be legally required to provide quality adult education. The Scottish government said it was committed to supporting adult learners and has provided more than £1m of funding this year to adult learning organisations working directly in communities across Scotland. A spokesperson said: ""The further and higher education minister has also announced an independent review of community learning and development provision across Scotland which includes adult learning.

Eckhardt and Rozelle Bosch were giving evidence at the start of a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) into the deaths of three babies in North Lanarkshire. Mirabelle Bosch died at Wishaw General Hospital on 2 July 2021. She was 12 hours and one minute old. The FAI is also looking into the deaths of Ellie McCormick and Leo Lamont. Ellie died at Wishaw General on 5 March 2019, five hours after her birth. Leo was two hours old when he died at Monklands Hospital on 15 February 2019. Mirabelle Bosch's father Eckhardt told the hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court that the system had failed his family. He said he believed his daughter had died due to an undiagnosed breech. This is where the baby is lying bottom or feet first in the womb, instead of head first. The inquiry heard that all parties accepted that Mirabelle's head was trapped throughout the delivery. Paramedics had attended the couple's home in Shotts but had been unable to fully deliver the baby and had called for more specialised help. However, they were only able to speak to hospital doctors over the phone. After a second paramedic crew arrived, attempts were made to make contact with maternity triage at Wishaw. Five attempts were made before their call was answered. Mrs Bosch was then transferred to hospital where she eventually received specialist care, but after being delivered Mirabelle was noted to be white, floppy and had no audible heart rate. Hours later, her life support was withdrawn. A post-mortem examination, conducted by Dr Dawn Penman, found that there was a long delay between the arrival of paramedics and transfer to hospital, and that the baby was ""well"" up until the point of delivery. She found that although it was recognised by medical staff that the baby was in breech position at a 31-week scan, they assumed in later assessments at 37 weeks that she was no longer in breech. Dr Penman's report said it was not clear how this assumption at 37 weeks was made, and that the assessment the baby had turned to another position appeared to have affected advice prior to, and during, labour. She found it likely that the management plan would have been different had the breech been recognised. Mirabelle's cause of death was recorded as breech home delivery with head entrapment. Mr Bosch said his family were ""led into a dark tunnel"" by ""misguided instructions"" given to him and his wife which gave them a ""wrong sense of security"". He claimed the procedures in place at Wishaw General were unable to diagnose Mirabelle's position correctly, which he believed had led to her death. ""The system failed us, we fell through the net,"" Mr Bosch said. He said that throughout a pre-natal examination prior to his baby's death the couple were informed they were on a ""safe pathway when the opposite was the case"". ""Incorrect diagnosis meant incorrect guidance, which meant incorrect decision-making ultimately causing the death of Mirabelle,"" he said. He said: ""We were told Rozelle was healthy and Mirabelle was healthy. I think this was a lie and the consequences have me standing here today. ""In all the scans, Mirabelle was not red flagged and was seen as normal. Me and my wife were calm due to the information put as it was. ""'Everything will be fine' rings in my ears."" Mr Bosch also said the Scottish Ambulance Service were ""misguided and misled"" and ""incompetent to deal with this situation."" And he said he did not believe his wife should have been sent home from hospital after her waters had broken. ""We had to travel quite far away from Wishaw Hospital - it is a clear systematic failure on a large scale,"" he said, adding: ""One thing led to the next - the system was not able to save us or Mirabelle."" Ms Bosch said she wished she had taken matters into her own hands after being sent home from hospital when her waters broke. Mr Bosch told the court he still felt the trauma in his body thinking of how his wife was dealt with by paramedics when they called for help. The death sparked a review of the Lanarkshire Health Board and eight recommendations were made - six of which have been implemented to date. Mirabelle, Leo and Ellie were all said to have died ""in circumstances giving rise to serious public concern"". In her opening comments, Sheriff Principal Aisha Anwar said: ""The death of a child is an unimaginable and deeply tragic event in any parent's life. ""I would like to commence this chapter of the inquiry as I commenced the first preliminary hearing, by again offering my deepest condolences to the parents of each child."" She said hearing evidence was likely to be a ""distressing and painful experience"" for the parents but evidence that was not controversial had been agreed. She added that the first chapter of the evidence would focus on the circumstances of Mirabelle's death, followed by those of Ellie and then Leo. ""It is important that I remind all present that the purpose of this inquiry is not to apportion blame,"" she said. She said the inquiry was to establish the circumstances of the deaths of Mirabelle, Ellie and Leo and to consider what steps, if any, might be taken to prevent other children dying in similar circumstances. Lawyer Darren Deery, a specialist in medical negligence, is representing the McCormick family at the inquiry. He told BBC Scotland News: ""The family's understanding is that there were potential defects in the system, in that certain risk factors weren't highlighted in the way they could, and should, have been. ""And had the subsequent midwifery and obstetrics staff been aware of those risks, a different course of action would have been taken and the outcome may well have been different."" He said the McCormick family believed that Ellie's death was entirely avoidable. The inquiry continues.","['Airdrie', 'Wishaw', 'Babies & toddlers', 'NHS Lanarkshire']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15301/production/_132258768_gettyimages-640974708.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10DA2/production/_132062096_header-image-aboutus.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9399/production/_132258773_spin-babiesfaiglasgowsheriff-002.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1BC2/production/_132260170_faibabydeathlawyer_frame_3989.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

Kellyanne McNaughton killed senior support worker Michele Rutherford, 54, at her supported accommodation in Stirling in March last year.Two other carers, Moira McMillan and Victoria Hendry, were also stabbed before they persuaded 33-year-old McNaughton to release the knife.McNaughton had faced a murder accusation but prosecutors accepted her guilty plea to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.This was on the basis of diminished responsibility due to her mental health issues at the time. The case was adjourned until late January but the High Court in Glasgow heard that McNaughton will remain in prison until she can be transferred to a mental health facility. McNaughton lived within supported accommodation with other residents at Craighall Court in Stirling, run by The Richmond Fellowship charity.The court heard she was not previously considered violent but an incident in her personal life appeared to ""trigger"" a change in behaviour. In the lead-up to the incident, McNaughton made a number of claims including how she could hear children screaming.Staff at the facility attempted to phone a psychiatrist that McNaughton was previously under the care of, but they were told a referral would have to be made through her GP.McNaughton was then left in the care of staff until the stabbing incident on 7 March 2023. After the incident, Ms Rutherford, a mother of two, was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where she died that day. After her arrest, McNaughton admitted to police that she had stabbed her three carers and called herself ""demonic"". The plan is for McNaughton to receive treatment for her conditions, but the only Scots 'high risk"" facility is the State Hospital at Carstairs, which caters for men.The court heard there has been initial discussions about her being transferred to a hospital in England.Lord Armstrong initially adjourned the case until late January and McNaughton will remain in prison meantime.",['Mental health'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ac02/live/675cfaa0-aee3-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/da5c/live/73fec960-aee7-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/53a1/live/7bb32aa0-aee4-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3gy2835zq1o,3D printed guns found in Scotland for first time,N/A,2024-01-09,"Firearms made using 3D printers have been discovered in Scotland for the first time, it has been revealed.Police Scotland confirmed to police magazine 1919, following a freedom of information request, that two incidents involving 3D guns occurred last year.One incident took place in the Argyll and West Dunbartonshire division in April, followed by another in Tayside a month later. Forensic services, which also flagged the issue, told the Scottish Police Authority they were handling increasingly complex cases involving such firearms. Firearms expert David Dyson told the magazine: ""(The guns) can be made quite quickly and easily from a 3D printer, and then you need some metal components - it requires a bit of skill but a fairly practical person would be able to do it.""Police Scotland said it was keeping on top of the issue and spoke regularly with bodies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (Nabis). 3D-printed guns are a type of firearms known as ghost guns, lacking serial numbers which makes them harder to trace. They were initially developed in 2013 by Cody Wilson, the American founder of the gun advocacy group Defence Distributed. The gun, named the Liberator, was a single-shot weapon, less accurate than an average pistol, and predominantly constructed from plastic. Wilson subsequently published the blueprints online, triggering a court battle in the US. The predominantly plastic construction of the gun raised concerns about the potential ability to evade detection by metal detectors.In 2013, Israeli journalists, external managed to sneak guns based on Mr Wilson's designs through security and into the country's parliament. Since then, the technology has developed, involving the use of aluminium in the process, resulting in more reliable guns. In recent years, the UK has witnessed a growing number of incidents and arrests linked to the production of 3D-printed firearms. In 2022, authorities seized 17, a notable increase from three in 2021. Home production of guns and parts has been prohibited under the Firearms Act 1968, effectively banning the creation of 3D firearms in the UK.In November 2022, the UK government updated legislation to explicitly include these weapons in the 1968 Firearms Act. The first person in the UK charged with making a gun using a 3D printer was Tendai Muswere in 2019. The 26-year-old, from Pimlico in London, was jailed for three years for manufacturing the firearm.",['Police Scotland'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/594/cpsprodpb/5df8/live/77e5e1e0-aed7-11ee-961a-8f3ef8d9ce75.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/82b3/live/57550100-aee0-11ee-9568-136f6030816d.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

People running post offices were accused of crimes like theft, false accounting or embezzlement on the basis of a faulty IT system called Horizon. Some were convicted and sent to prison, others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Their plight has been highlighted in a new ITV drama called Mr Bates vs The Post Office. We don't know the exact number. In Scotland the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service holds sole responsibility for prosecutions. That's different to England where the Post Office prosecuted cases. In 2020 the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - which investigates possible miscarriages of justice - wrote to 73 potential victims of the Horizon scandal in Scotland. As of December 2023 only 16 people had come forward in Scotland to ask for their convictions to be reviewed. That number may rise in the coming days and weeks given the renewed publicity around the Horizon scandal. In November 2022 the SCCRC gave six people permission to appeal Horizon convictions in court. Of those initial six cases only two convictions have so far been overturned. The other four are still waiting for an outcome. In the UK as a whole 93 convictions have been quashed. It is possible there are hundreds of people across Scotland who were accused of stealing money from their post office branches who weren't convicted. A UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal is ongoing and in 2022 it came to Glasgow to hear evidence from affected sub-postmasters and mistresses in Scotland. None of those giving evidence had been convicted but they described the desperation they felt when their accounts repeatedly showed shortfalls. They talked about the dire impact being accused of stealing had on their reputations, finances and mental health. Some people who were accused but not convicted have received compensation: others are still waiting. We know that some sub-postmasters and mistresses died before the extent of the Horizon scandal was uncovered. People whose Horizon convictions are overturned are entitled to apply for £600,000 compensation. In a letter to the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board in October 2023 the Crown Office said Scotland was ""very much closer to the start of its journey"" in addressing potential miscarriages of justice related to Horizon compared to other parts of the UK. The next court hearing in Scotland is on Friday. It is possible two more convictions will be overturned then because the Crown Office has indicated it won't oppose two of the cases. Once the initial six appeals have concluded the Crown Office said it anticipated that ""a streamlined and expedient process of review, appeal and disposal""  will be available for future cases. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from prosecutions in England. Police Scotland has said it isn't currently investigating but ""is liaising with other UK law enforcement partners and any information received will be assessed.""","['Post offices', 'Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/161B4/production/_129884509_gettyimages-525140033.jpg'],['Katie Hunter'],UK,Scotland

His uncle Napoleon was one of history's greatest military commanders - winning battles across Europe - and emperor of France. His French army was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 by a coalition force, which included British, Dutch, German and Prussian soldiers. Napoleon surrendered and was exiled to St Helena, an island in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821. His nephew Louis Lucien was a philologist, a person who studies the history of languages.Prof O Maolalaigh said the prince was celebrated in Wales for his research on Welsh, but was almost unknown in Scotland.He toured Scotland in 1858, visiting his Gaelic and Scots language contacts. They included church ministers.Prof O Maolalaigh said the prince travelled incognito, the wider public unaware of who he was, and his tour took him to Skye and Shetland. In Inverness, Louis Lucien sought Gaelic translations of Biblical texts and later attended a sermon given by a Rev Archibald Clark in Kilmallie.Prof O Maolalaigh said: ""He was clearly interested in the sounds and acquiring some sort of fluency in the language.""He was a pioneer in putting emphasis on fieldwork and actually speaking to native speakers, and not just relying on the written word.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67911483,Missing Stone of Destiny chip found in SNP cupboard,"A ""missing"" fragment of the Stone of Destiny gifted to Alex Salmond is being held in storage by the SNP.",2024-01-09,"A ""missing"" fragment of the Stone of Destiny gifted to Alex Salmond is being held in storage by the SNP. Newly released Scottish government documents revealed the former first minister received the chip in 2008. The chip was initially feared lost, but has since been uncovered in a cupboard at the SNP HQ. Conservative politicians called for the chip to be donated to a new museum in Perth which will house the rest of the ancient symbolic stone. The stone, also known as the Stone of Scone, was used as the coronation location for Scottish kings until it was seized and taken to Westminster Abbey by King Edward I of England in 1296 during the wars of independence. Then in 1950, four students broke into Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day and stole the stone so they could ""repatriate"" it to Scotland. The group were funded and backed by SNP co-founder John MacCormick. According to Scottish Cabinet papers released on 1 January, it was Mr MacCormick's son, Prof Sir Neil MacCormick, who presented Alex Salmond with the fragment of the stone back in 2008. Mr Salmond, who was first minister from 2007 until 2014, said the fragment was handed to the SNP for safekeeping after he had ""checked"" with Historic Scotland that it was not wanted in the public collection. However, the public body said it had ""no records"" of that check taking place. SNP activist Stewart Duncan told The National newspaper that on a visit to the party's HQ he had seen the ""small fragment of stone"" in a ""clear plastic box"". He added: ""I was quite shocked that it was just tucked away in a cupboard. Incredible to see though."" The SNP said it was unable to verify whether the fragment had actually come from the historic artefact. A spokesperson explained: """"The SNP has a small stone chip in storage. It is claimed to be a fragment of the Stone of Scone but, much like the stone in Edinburgh Castle, its provenance has not been established."" Mr Salmond told the Sunday Mail: ""I was accused of having 'stolen' the fragment and its return was demanded to someone, somewhere. ""And then lo and behold it turned up in SNP HQ at the end of the week. No doubt this came as a red-faced surprise to the blue Tory gang."" The UK government's Scottish ­Secretary, Alister Jack, and his ­predecessor Michael ­Forsyth said Mr Salmond should not have accepted the gift in the first place, and called for it to be put on display alongside the rest of the stone. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said it was one of Scotland's most important cultural artefacts and should not be kept in a cupboard in an SNP office. The Stone of Destiny is regarded as one of Scotland's most important cultural artefacts because it was used as the coronation seat for Scottish monarchs for more than 700 years before being stolen by England's Edward I in the late 13th century. It remained south of the border for 654 years, during which time it was built into the base of a chair on which various English and British monarchs were crowned. On Christmas Day 1950, a group of four Scottish students stole the stone from Westminster Abbey, with plans to repatriate it to Scotland. It was found, covered with a saltire, on the high altar at the ruined Arbroath Abbey in 1951, months after it was taken from Westminster Abbey. From there, it was returned to London where it remained until 1996, when it was sent back to be put on display in Edinburgh Castle. It has remained there ever since bar a brief sojourn back to Westminster Abbey for the coronation of King Charles III. The stone will be moved from Edinburgh Castle to a new museum in Perth when it opens in the spring. That is if the current stone is accepted as the original. Legend suggests monks at the monastery threw the original in the River Tay to prevent English soldiers getting their hands on it, while other stories allege copies were made in 1950 and the one set to be moved to Perth is fake.","['Edinburgh', 'Perth', 'Alex Salmond', 'SNP (Scottish National Party)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15827/production/_132230188_stone.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/98BF/production/_132230193_beab287f18731f398844e8b84d479b912cad8371.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

The construction firm, based in the north-east of Scotland, said it faced ""significant challenges"" since Covid. It comes after an attempt to sell the company by its chairman Stewart Milne fell through last year. Administrator Teneo said 217 jobs would be affected, with hundreds of other sub-contractor roles also expected to be impacted. Six of the company's subsidiaries have also been placed into administration, but its north-west England arm has not. Trade roles working on the housebuilder's sites will also go as a result of the firm's collapse. The administrators said sub-contractors should not undertake any more work for the business, and site access - for example to collect equipment - should not be attempted unless approved by the administrators. Teneo said the company was ""exploring its options"" but was looking to work with other developers on the completion of unfinished sites. Buyers who have purchased or reserved homes from Stewart Milne Group and have not yet moved in will be contacted by the administrators directly. Current residents with outstanding works are asked to contact the SMHomeowners@teneo.com for further information. Adele MacLeod of Teneo said: ""The downturn in the UK housing market combined with an extensive sales process not resulting in any viable offers has ultimately led to the need for the directors to place Stewart Milne Group Limited and some of its subsidiaries into administration, regretfully with some immediate redundancies. ""We continue to assess all the options in respect of the group's Scottish development sites and encourage any party with an interest to get in touch."" The house builder, which develops sites across north east and central Scotland and north west England, was put up for sale in 2022 after its founder Stewart Milne announced his intention to retire, but the sale was suspended due to ""economic uncertainty"" and market conditions. It was relisted for sale in July 2023, however failed to attract a viable buyer. The company reported a boost in profits for the 21/22 financial year having sold its timber systems business in December 2021. It recorded pre-tax profits of £16.5m for the year to the end of October 2022. However, turnover fell year-on-year by £48.7m to £172.4m as house sales fell by nearly 30% to 583. A spokeswoman for Lloyds Banking Group stated that they had attempted to find a solution that would place the business on a ""sounder financial footing"" and avoid insolvency. She added: ""Unfortunately, despite several years of support and forbearance, including multiple maturity extensions to the borrowing, this has not been possible in this instance."" The business was started by former Aberdeen Football Club chairman Stewart Milne in 1975 after he qualified as an electrician. He postponed his retirement in an attempt to secure the future of the firm amid talks with ""seriously interested parties"". Mr Milne, 73, said: ""I am devastated by this totally unexpected outcome of the sale process and struggling to accept it, given the profound impact it will have on employees, sub-contractors, suppliers and customers. ""Stewart Milne Group was up for sale and, following significant interest, two bids were submitted. The bank has not accepted either bid and withdrawn its funding. ""I tried everything I could to find a way to achieve a better outcome for the business and the people who depend on it. ""I believe one of the bids could have delivered a comparable, financial return to administration and, crucially, allowed the business to continue to operate, safe-guarding hundreds of jobs and protecting livelihoods."" SNP MP for Aberdeen South, Stephen Flynn, said the news would be a bitter blow to workers and all those involved with the company.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67922317,Scotland seeks opinions on conversion therapy laws,A public consultation is under way on planned laws to ban conversion therapy for sexuality or gender in Scotland.,2024-01-09,"A public consultation is under way on planned laws to ban conversion therapy for sexuality or gender in Scotland. Equalities Minister Emma Roddick said conversion practices ""have absolutely no place in Scotland"". The proposed ban has raised concerns from those who fear attempts to counsel people struggling with their identity could be seen as conversion therapy. Conversion therapy refers to practices ""aiming to change or supress a person's sexual orientation or gender identity"". A 86-page proposal document was released alongside the online consultation, which closes on 2 April. The Scottish government wants to ""lead the way"" on a ban after the UK government left it out of the King's Speech in November, five years after first promising it. This followed disagreements about what form a ban should take, whether it should include talking therapies for people questioning their gender and concerns over its impact on freedom of expression and religious freedoms. During a visit to LGBT Health and Wellbeing in Edinburgh, Ms Roddick told BBC Scotland News the ban would apply to ""so-called therapy services"" or ""coercive behaviour"" that tried to change someone's sexuality or the gender they identified as. She also insisted that the right to a family life and religious beliefs would be protected. And Ms Roddick added that an individual's actions would only qualify as a conversion practice if it was done with intent and caused ""actual harm"" to a victim. The minister said conversion practices were ""damaging and destructive acts that violate people's human rights"" and Scotland was leading the way in the UK to ban them. ""Sadly, these practices still happen today and they have absolutely no place in Scotland,"" she said. Ms Roddick added that a parent would only be criminalised if they caused harm to their child who was coming out as gay or transgender. She said: ""The consultation responses we receive will help us to further consider those measures we can take to stop the harm of conversion practices and protect those at risk while ensuring that freedoms - including freedoms of speech, religion, and belief - are safeguarded."" However, concerns have been raised about the scope of the proposed laws and the lack of clear definitions in the legislation. The LGB Alliance, a charity supporting lesbian, gay and bisexual rights, said they were concerned that new laws on gender identity could outlaw any response to a child questioning their gender ""other than affirmation of their self-diagnosis"". Scottish trustee Rhona Hotchkiss, a former women's prison governor, said: ""We know that the majority of unhappy children presenting at gender clinics describe themselves as same-sex attracted. ""The affirmation-at-all-costs approach hurts confused young people - most of whom would grow up to be happily lesbian, gay of bisexual if left alone by the gender industry."" She added: ""'Transing away the gay' is the real conversion therapy."" Ms Hotchkiss also questioned why the consultation document used the term LGBTQI+ throughout because same-sex attracted people had their own needs and were disadvantaged when ""force-teamed"" in campaigns by TQ+ lobbyists. A Scottish government spokesman said no-one should be coerced to change or suppress their sexual orientation or gender identity, ""whether this is to change them from gay to straight: transgender to cisgender, or vice versa"". However, medical treatments by a healthcare professional relating to a person's gender identity would not be considered a conversion practice. The Christian Institute, which opposed Holyrood's failed ""named person"" guardian scheme, said they would take the Scottish government to court if a new law threatened free speech or criminalised parents and church leaders. Deputy director Simon Calvert said: ""We are particularly worried about the government's plans for 'civil protection orders'. ""The courts could impose draconian limits on the free speech of individuals based purely on activists' speculation about what they might say to gay or trans people,"" he said. ""Our solicitors wrote to the government preparing the ground for judicial review in February 2022."" Mr Calvert added: ""Gay and trans people are already protected, quite rightly, from verbal and physical abuse by existing law."" The Catholic Church in Scotland said it supported laws protecting people from physical and verbal abuse, but religious bodies and organisations needed to be free to support members who wish to live in accordance with their beliefs. Peter Kearney, from the Scottish Catholic Media Office, said there was a ""worrying lack of clarity about what is meant by the term conversion practices"" and warned that new legislation ""could create a chilling effect and may criminalise advice or opinion given in good faith"". ""We would urge the Scottish government, not to criminalise mainstream religious pastoral care, parental guidance, and medical or other professional intervention relating to sexual orientation, which is not approved by the State as acceptable,"" he said. Situations that could be covered by the proposed legislation, if carried out with the intention to change or suppress a person's sexual orientation or gender identity and which cause that person harm, include: A new criminal offences of engaging in conversion practice would be created, including both providing a service and engaging in a course of coercive behaviour - as well as taking a person out of Scotland to engage in conversion practices. Prosecutors would have to prove anyone engaging in conversion practices intended to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity and that the practices or services caused physical or psychological harm to the victim. The document said those accused would have a defence if their actions could be proven to be ""reasonable in the particular circumstances"". While the Scottish government has no statistics on the number of people subjected to conversion practices or groups using these methods, it pointed to UK government's 2017 online National LGBT Survey, which found that of 108,000 self-selecting LGBTI respondents, 2.4% had received ""conversion"" or ""reparative"" therapy to cure them of being gay. The consultation documents said it was harder to obtain information because conversion practices ""often happen in religious, community and family setting"" and ""many LGBTQI+ people in the UK have roots in other countries where conversion practices and other psychological therapeutic practices are the norm"". Mark Kelvin, chief executive of LGBT Health and Wellbeing - which has been offering support to people in Scotland for two decades, said: ""Whilst we'd like to think that [conversion practices] are a thing of the past, or not happening in Scotland, we know that some LGBTQ+ people in Scotland are still being subjected to these abhorrent practices and we welcome the Scottish government's leadership and action on this issue.""","['Scottish government', 'LGBT']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10AC1/production/_113298286_resizedgaycouple2017cparef30966895.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D223/production/_132259735_conversiontherapyministerialvisit0901_frame_5784.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16A7B/production/_132259729_simoncalvert-002.png']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

The proposal, approved by the city council, will see the complex constructed at the junction of St Vincent Street and Pitt Street. The development replaces previously approved plans to build a hotel or serviced apartments on the site. It is the third student accommodation plan to be approved in recent months. A demand assessment, prepared on behalf of the applicants Artisan Real Estate, found that while Glasgow has ""an established purpose-built student accommodation market, it does not provide the amount of good quality accommodation required to house"" the city's students. It added even ""under cautious growth scenarios,"" supply of available student housing was unlikely to meet demand. The applicants were previously granted permission to build a 248-bed hotel and 248 serviced apartments on the site but neither project went ahead. Artisan's application said the serviced apartments plan could not be funded because of restrictions imposed on occupancy, while the hotel plan was abandoned because of the impact of Covid-19 on the hospitality sector. Having reassessed the market, it had decided to partner with Homes for Student to provide high quality student accommodation to meet the needs of the city, it said. An empty mid-1980s office block at 292 to 298 St Vincent Street will be knocked down to make way for the development. The application stated it ""essentially follows the same design of the proposed hotel scheme"".

Kellyanne McNaughton killed senior support worker Michele Rutherford, 54, at her supported accommodation in Stirling in March last year.Two other carers, Moira McMillan and Victoria Hendry, were also stabbed before they persuaded 33-year-old McNaughton to release the knife.McNaughton had faced a murder accusation but prosecutors accepted her guilty plea to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.This was on the basis of diminished responsibility due to her mental health issues at the time. The case was adjourned until late January but the High Court in Glasgow heard that McNaughton will remain in prison until she can be transferred to a mental health facility. McNaughton lived within supported accommodation with other residents at Craighall Court in Stirling, run by The Richmond Fellowship charity.The court heard she was not previously considered violent but an incident in her personal life appeared to ""trigger"" a change in behaviour. In the lead-up to the incident, McNaughton made a number of claims including how she could hear children screaming.Staff at the facility attempted to phone a psychiatrist that McNaughton was previously under the care of, but they were told a referral would have to be made through her GP.McNaughton was then left in the care of staff until the stabbing incident on 7 March 2023. After the incident, Ms Rutherford, a mother of two, was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where she died that day. After her arrest, McNaughton admitted to police that she had stabbed her three carers and called herself ""demonic"". The plan is for McNaughton to receive treatment for her conditions, but the only Scots 'high risk"" facility is the State Hospital at Carstairs, which caters for men.The court heard there has been initial discussions about her being transferred to a hospital in England.Lord Armstrong initially adjourned the case until late January and McNaughton will remain in prison meantime.",['Mental health'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ac02/live/675cfaa0-aee3-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/da5c/live/73fec960-aee7-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/53a1/live/7bb32aa0-aee4-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gy2xvgld0o,We live on building site after Stewart Milne collapse,N/A,2024-01-09,"The owner of a new Stewart Milne Group home fears he will be left to live on a building site after the housebuilding firm collapsed. Callum Strachan and his young family moved into the new-build property in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, a month ago. Building work was continuing on neighbouring properties until the firm went into administration on Monday, with the loss of more than 200 jobs. The construction business, based in the north-east of Scotland, said it had faced ""significant challenges"" since Covid. Mr Strachan, 27, said he had been left ""high and dry"" by the announcement. “I didn’t believe it,” he told BBC Scotland News of first hearing the news. “My granny phoned and I just thought ‘no, you’ve got to be joking’.“We’ve only just moved into a house a month ago, we haven’t got a garden, there’s repairs ongoing, I don’t know what to do.“Outside of our house is just a complete building site, it’s a fence and then ongoing works and stuff everywhere."" He said he feared for the safety of his young son and daughter on the Dunnottar Park development. “We have a three-year-old and a one-year-old, it’s not safe at all, somebody’s going to have to fix it,"" he added.“I don’t want to be living on a building site for the next year, two years, but who’s going to pick it up?”He said he felt “pretty confused” about the situation.“They haven’t communicated to me but I’ve attempted to get hold of them,” he said. Rodney Chan, 30, moved to Aberdeen from Hong Kong two years ago.He bought a home in Cove in October last year, but said that after just three days he noticed the patio door was leaking. Despite repairs being carried out by Stewart Milne Homes, Mr Chan said it happens again every time there is heavy rainfall.He was expecting someone to come and assess water damage on Tuesday, but said he received a call from the Stewart Milne sales office in the morning to say the visit was now cancelled. He is now concerned any future snagging issues will be left to him to fix and pay for. “I just feel stranded, with no-one to help,"" he said. ""I know NHBC (National House Building Council) can help, but it seems they only focus on structural problems. I just feel terrible, desperate for help and I don’t know who I can reach. “I just got an automatic reply (from the administrator) which said, you will need to reach NHBC and if they don’t cover then you will need to do it yourself then make an unsecured claim for the money. ""I don’t know who to turn to, I bought a house with such a high sum of money and now I don’t have any help.“Now it is the patio door, but later down the line, who can imagine?” Dylan Paris, speaking in Hamilton, said he had been a site labourer with Stewart Milne for about 10 years. He said: “We turned up to work just as usual then around about four o'clock there was an email sent out to the gaffers to basically get everyone into the offices to sit around and go into a Teams meeting and then from there we found out that we were all being made redundant.""So we just headed home basically. ""I loved working for the company, it was a good company to work for. So it’s devastating to see. It’s a sad end for Stewart Milne really."" He added: ""I’m panicking really. I need to get another job lined up as quick as possible so I can keep paying my bills basically."" The housebuilder's collapse came after an attempt to sell the company by its chairman Stewart Milne fell through last year.Administrator Teneo said 217 jobs would be affected.Hundreds of other sub-contractor roles also expected to be hit. Jane Wood, chief executive of Homes for Scotland, said she feared the situation could be repeated. She told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme she was “surprised” and “overall greatly saddened” by the Stewart Milne Homes news.“It’s a tough market out there,” she said. “Housebuilding is a complex sector and it has an extensive supply chain.""We are slightly concerned we’ll see more of this. It’s a worry."" The administrators said sub-contractors should not undertake more work for the business, and site access - to collect equipment for example - should not be attempted unless approved by the administrators.Teneo said the company was ""exploring options"" but was looking to work with other developers on the completion of unfinished sites.Buyers who have bought or reserved homes from Stewart Milne Group and have not yet moved in will be contacted by the administrators directly.Current residents with outstanding works are asked to contact the SMHomeowners@teneo.com for further information.The Unite union said it would explore possible legal action on behalf of members, in terms of a ""lack of consultation"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gy2835zq1o,3D printed guns found in Scotland for first time,N/A,2024-01-09,"Firearms made using 3D printers have been discovered in Scotland for the first time, it has been revealed.Police Scotland confirmed to police magazine 1919, following a freedom of information request, that two incidents involving 3D guns occurred last year.One incident took place in the Argyll and West Dunbartonshire division in April, followed by another in Tayside a month later. Forensic services, which also flagged the issue, told the Scottish Police Authority they were handling increasingly complex cases involving such firearms. Firearms expert David Dyson told the magazine: ""(The guns) can be made quite quickly and easily from a 3D printer, and then you need some metal components - it requires a bit of skill but a fairly practical person would be able to do it.""Police Scotland said it was keeping on top of the issue and spoke regularly with bodies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (Nabis). 3D-printed guns are a type of firearms known as ghost guns, lacking serial numbers which makes them harder to trace. They were initially developed in 2013 by Cody Wilson, the American founder of the gun advocacy group Defence Distributed. The gun, named the Liberator, was a single-shot weapon, less accurate than an average pistol, and predominantly constructed from plastic. Wilson subsequently published the blueprints online, triggering a court battle in the US. The predominantly plastic construction of the gun raised concerns about the potential ability to evade detection by metal detectors.In 2013, Israeli journalists, external managed to sneak guns based on Mr Wilson's designs through security and into the country's parliament. Since then, the technology has developed, involving the use of aluminium in the process, resulting in more reliable guns. In recent years, the UK has witnessed a growing number of incidents and arrests linked to the production of 3D-printed firearms. In 2022, authorities seized 17, a notable increase from three in 2021. Home production of guns and parts has been prohibited under the Firearms Act 1968, effectively banning the creation of 3D firearms in the UK.In November 2022, the UK government updated legislation to explicitly include these weapons in the 1968 Firearms Act. The first person in the UK charged with making a gun using a 3D printer was Tendai Muswere in 2019. The 26-year-old, from Pimlico in London, was jailed for three years for manufacturing the firearm.",['Police Scotland'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/594/cpsprodpb/5df8/live/77e5e1e0-aed7-11ee-961a-8f3ef8d9ce75.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/82b3/live/57550100-aee0-11ee-9568-136f6030816d.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

Mark Williams, from Abertillery, was diagnosed with MND 18 months ago after he began experiencing slurred speech and muscle twitching. MND is a debilitating condition that affects the brain and nerves, and there is currently no cure. His wife, Steph, says Mark now plans to raise money and awareness for the condition. Father-of-two Mark worked as a child therapist and Steph says talking was a big part of his job. He knew something was wrong when his speech started to change. ""The doctor's first thought was it was acid reflux laryngitis and sent us away with medication for that,"" Steph said. ""But Mark knew deep down something wasn't right. But we put it down to stress. ""People kept asking if he'd had a drink because of his speech."" His physiotherapist noticed his reflexes had changed and advised Mark to go for an MRI scan, which he did privately to avoid a six-to-nine month NHS waiting list, and he was diagnosed with MND. Steph described the nine months between the initial symptoms and diagnosis as the hardest time. ""He was just thinking he had terminal illness and Mark was adamant it was MND. He was so upset because of the impact it would have on us as a family rather than himself. ""Mark was the breadwinner, the planner, he was everything and all that was stripped away and that's a tough pill to swallow."" While the condition mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s, MND can be diagnosed in people of any age. ""When we finally got the diagnosis. Mark shook the consultant's hand and said thank you because he knew, and the wait was over."" Mark decided to begin fundraising for Doddie Aid which was set up in the name of former Scotland rugby international Doddie Weir, who died or MND at the age of 52. Mark has also been recording phrases with his own voice to use with speech-generating communication devices, known as voice banking. ""We didn't have time to be sad. Because Mark was doing the fundraising and voice banking."" Doddie Aid has raised more than £4m for MND research in three years, and Mark completed 700 miles on his exercise bike last year for the foundation and hopes to do 200 miles this month. ""I feel like we've got to keep on with Doddie's work and taking on that baton,"" Steph said. After Mark's condition progressed, Steph finished working to become a full-time carer for her husband.

Lorraine Williams, from Anglesey, said they should ""face court cases"" and ""be hit in their pockets"". Mrs Williams was accused of stealing £14,600 back in June 2011 and was later given a 52-week suspended sentence. Her comments came after former CEO, Paula Vennells, said would be returning her CBE in light of the scandal. In an interview with Newyddion S4C, Mrs Williams, who ran a post office in Llanddaniel Fab, stated that further steps should now be taken. ""Why should she be given the opportunity to return it when it should have been taken from her?"" said Mrs Williams. ""It's as though she's said 'There we are, you can have it back - everything's okay now'. ""She should have to go to court as we've had to do - she should be made to feel as we've had to feel."" One of hundreds convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud between 1999 and 2015 due to Japanese tech company Fujitsu's faulty Horizon software, Mrs Williams was ordered to repay the £14,600 missing on her watch and undertake 200 hours of community service. After receiving legal advice, she pleaded guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012 in order to avoid jail, and later suffered numerous health conditions, depression and was ostracization from the local community as a result. She said she travelled down a ""very dark tunnel"" on occasions and only survived the past decade and a half because of her family's support. Her ordeal, and that of many others like her, has recently been highlighted in the acclaimed ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. ""Is she [Paula Vennells]  going to have nightmares over this, will it affect her family or will it affect her financially?"" said Mrs Williams. ""No, probably not - but that's what should happen, just like it did to normal people like us. ""I just want it all over with once and for all and for whoever was responsible to be properly punished,"" she added. Earlier on Tuesday, Ms Vennells said she had ""listened"" to the sub-postmasters and others calling for her to return the honour awarded to her in 2019 for ""services to the Post Office"". ""I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result,"" she said. Fujitsu said it was fully committed to supporting the inquiry to learn from the events stretching back two decades. ""The inquiry has reinforced the devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families, and Fujitsu has apologised for its role in their suffering,"" the firm said.","['Wales', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1141F/production/_118678607_zzzcropped_lorrainep1011675.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15974/production/_132263488_vennells_h.jpg']",['Gwyn Loader'],UK,Wales

Charlotte Symons, 40, killed Sandra Chamberlain, 67, after hitting her with a Nissan Navara in Markham, Caerphilly. Mrs Chamberlain was taken to hospital following the incident in December 2022 and later died of her injuries. On Tuesday Symons was jailed for four years and eight months at Cardiff Crown Court. Symons, a mother-of-two from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was banned from driving for nine years and four months. The court heard she failed to brake as she returned from a shopping trip when she struck pedestrian Mrs Chamberlain. ""Much-loved"" Mrs Chamberlain had popped to the shops to post Christmas cards when she was hit by Symons' car. Symons was also out shopping and was on her way home when she cut across the mini-roundabout. Footage played to the court showed Mrs Chamberlain being knocked to the ground and Symons jumping from the vehicle saying: ""I didn't see her."" Gareth James, prosecuting, said Mrs Chamberlain was rushed to hospital with serious head injuries but died eight days later on 17 December, 2022. ""Mrs Chamberlain was wearing a bright red jacket, she would have been clearly visible to other road users,"" he said. ""She walked beyond the mini-roundabout before crossing over the road. She had almost crossed to the other side of the road when she was struck by the defendant's vehicle and run over."" He said instead of going the right way around the mini-roundabout, Symons cut across the road and entered the mini-roundabout on the wrong side of it. ""She then struck and ran down Mrs Chamberlain, who was in the opposite carriageway to the one the defendant should have been in, had she have been driving on the right side of the road,"" Mr James said. Mr James said Symons was arrested and initially told police she had gone around the roundabout the right way. She was later shown CCTV and admitted she had undercut the roundabout on several previous occasions as she had become ""complacent"". ""Had the defendant driven the correct way around the roundabout this collision would not have happened,"" Mr James said. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Chamberlain's daughter, Stacey Hoskin, said: ""We know the defendant didn't set out to hurt anyone that day, but as drivers it is our responsibility to ensure the road is clear before we manoeuvre. ""There are lots of ifs and buts about that day, but the biggest one is if she had followed the basic rules of driving we wouldn't be here today, and my mam still would. ""She went to the shop and to post some Christmas cards. Six weeks and four days later she came back to us in a coffin."" James Findon, defending, said: ""If the defendant could turn back the clock she would."" Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke said: ""Anyone viewing the recordings of what happened on that day will be at a loss to understand why you failed to see Mrs Chamberlain.

A string of bullying accusations has left the organisation's leadership in turmoil. Jo Stevens and Thangam Debbonaire said that a ""damaging situation"" was continuing ""unchecked"" by the UK government. The UK government said it has maintained regular contact with S4C. The chief executive of S4C, Sian Doyle, was sacked late last year ahead of the publication of a report which alleged she behaved like a dictator - accusations she denied. Her father later blamed S4C and the UK government for his daughter taking an overdose, saying she had been the subject herself of ""constant"" bullying. Chief content officer Llinos Griffin-Williams was also fired after she allegedly told a rugby star that his Welsh skills were not good enough and that she could end his career. The broadcaster's chairman, Rhodri Williams, has also been accused of acting inappropriately by shouting at Ms Griffin-Williams. He was said to have apologised. Ultimate control over broadcasting in Wales lies in London. S4C is overseen by its board, the chair of which is appointed by the UK government. In a joint letter, shadow Welsh secretary Ms Stevens and shadow culture secretary Ms Debbonaire said S4C ""cannot be allowed to flounder any further"". Writing to Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, the frontbenchers wrote: ""Since its inception in 1982, S4C has been an important representation of Welsh society, its people and language."" They said that ""recent efforts to modernise the channel have been overshadowed by a series of crises that suggest deep-rooted problems with the organisation's leadership, management and culture, which should be of real concern to you as the responsible Cabinet Minister."" The MPs said ""questions remain"" about the process that led to the independent report and the sacking of the two senior officers, and whether the S4C board ""and interim leadership can swiftly deliver the fundamental changes which are clearly needed to transform the organisation and its working environment"". ""However, there has been total silence from you and your department as this unfortunate saga has unfolded. ""We are deeply concerned that this is allowing a damaging situation to continue unchecked."" The letter asked if Ms Frazer would consider ""an investigation or rapid review"", and that she would ""begin to take a more active interest in its situation. It comes ahead of Rhodri Williams' evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. A department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS] spokesperson said: ""Complaints relating to members of staff are a matter for S4C, which is independent of the government. ""Now that the results of the investigation by Capital Law have been published, we expect S4C to address the issues identified as a matter of urgency.

The pair from St Asaph in Denbighshire say it is ""pure luck"" the fire was spotted in time before  spreading to the rest of the house. Electrical retailer Currys have apologised and say they will be monitoring other models closely. The company is also reassuring others with a similar machines that it hasn't found any cause for concern. Alyn London-Smith was relaxing at home on Saturday, 2 December, just before heading out to collect his wife Ellen from her work Christmas party. But, having smelled smoke, he went to investigate. ""I suddenly thought to myself that something wasn't right,"" he said. ""When I got to the kitchen all I could see was a smoky haze which seemed to be coming from the dishwasher. ""I opened the door and saw flames coming out of the bottom of the machine. ""It was pure luck that I hadn't gone to collect my wife already - 20 minutes later and the house would have been empty."" Mr London-Smith turned the dishwasher off and unsuccessfully attempted to put the fire out with water from the sink. ""Then I remembered that a friend had given me an old fire extinguisher a few years ago which was still in a shed in the garden,"" he said. ""I aimed it at the hole where the flames were coming through and it worked."" But the couple's kitchen ended up covered in soot and extinguisher powder. Ellen London-Smith added: ""It took us the rest of the weekend to clear the mess up - both of us working flat out with help from my mum. ""We bought the dishwasher, a Kenwood KID45S17, from Currys in December 2019 - almost exactly four years to the day it caught fire. ""They sent an engineer to look at it who confirmed that it couldn't be repaired and he seemed to think there'd been a wiring fault. ""Currys have also asked to have the fire-damaged dishwasher back so they can do further checks on it to see what could have gone wrong."" A Currys spokesperson said: ""We were extremely shocked to hear about Mr and Mrs London-Smith's case and treat situations like these with the upmost seriousness. ""Our product safety experts have not discovered any inherent issues with this model of dishwasher which should cause other owners concern.

Api Ratuniyarawa, 37, admitted two counts of assault by penetration and one of sexual assault at Revolution between 31 October and 2 November 2023. He was sentenced to two years and 10 months at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday. Ratuniyarawa, of The Orchard, Kislingbury, Northamptonshire, will serve up to half in custody. The rest will be served in the community. The court heard the three attacks happened independently of each other, on three separate nights in the same bar. All incidents were caught on CCTV, and none of the victims - who were all 19 - knew Ratuniyarawa or each other beforehand. Heath Edwards, prosecuting, said that dad-of-four Ratuniyarawa had been in Cardiff during the week leading up to the game on 4 November, and ""appears to have spent many of his nights socialising"" with teammates. In the early hours of Tuesday, 31 October, he assaulted his first victim in the VIP area of the bar, where he ""cornered her [and] put his hands down her trousers"". Mr Edwards added: ""She was clearly resisting the defendant and trying to move away from him."" The second victim was assaulted in the early hours of 2 November, where Mr Edwards said that Ratuniyarawa had touched the woman's breast and bottom. She had ""tried to move away,"" he said, but Ratuniyarawa was ""significantly stronger than she was"". Following the incident the woman told door staff, who asked Ratuniyarawa to leave. The following night Ratuniyarawa attacked a third woman, again in the VIP area of the bar, in a ""painful"" assault which left her ""bleeding"". Mr Edwards said the victim told him to stop ""several times"", and that ""he only stopped when others at the bar intervened"". One woman read out her victim impact statement in court, describing the attack on her as ""humiliating"". Her studies at university had been affected, and she now often became ""anxious and stressed"" when she went out. She added that she was also suffering from hair loss, difficulty eating and sleeping. ""This is the worst possible thing he could have done to me,"" she said. ""He's ruined my life by what he's done."" One victim said she could no longer watch rugby or wear the clothes she wore that night without thinking of the assault. Ruth Smith, defending, said Ratuniyarawa wished to apologise to his victims and he recognised the ""shame that he has brought to himself and his family"". Ms Smith said the amount of alcohol the defendant had drunk was ""highly significant"". The court heard the assaults had effectively ended his career. ""He knows his legacy is forever tarnished,"" said Ms Smith. Sentencing, Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke said: ""All the offences are aggravated because you were under the influence of alcohol, and I bear in mind physical injury was caused as well as the psychological injury that was caused on all three occasions. ""For all three offences I note you stopped only because others intervened."" Ratuniyarawa was given a restraining order against one woman for three years, and has also been placed on the sex offenders register. He had been a forward for London Irish before the club filed for administration when it was suspended from the Premiership. He was named in the squad for the Barbarians - the team that brings together players from different clubs for several fixtures each year - to play against Wales on 4 November before being charged. The lock, who has also played for Northampton Saints and in France, was hoping his appearance for the invitational side would lead to a contract with a new club, but has since been forced to apply for benefits.","['Wales', 'Cardiff', 'Kislingbury', 'Fiji']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/28FB/production/_131919401_gettyimages-1176947250.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EB4C/production/_132263206_adicapture.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/165E/production/_132262750_apinewproject-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13520/production/_132263197_revscapture.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B1EA/production/_132264554_adiinahatcapture.jpg']","['Iolo Cheung', 'James McCarthy']",UK,Wales

Erin, from Pontrhydfendigaid, Ceredigion, told BBC Wales in June that she was focussed on making her remaining time fun for sons Alex, then 13, and eight-year-old Harley. ""My main focus now is making the most of the time we have. I'm just not thinking about all the things that I'm going to miss and all of the things that we won't get to do,"" she said previously.

Zac, Erin's fourth and youngest son, died during a sleepover with his dad Shaun after suffering smoke inhalation following a caravan fire in Ffair Rhos, Ceredigion, in January 2020. The blaze, which also left his brother Harley with life-changing injuries, was probably caused by an electric fan heater, an inquest heard. Erin's second son Tyler, who had health complications after being born prematurely, died following a cardiac arrest in December 2012 when he was just a few months old. Erin, who married her husband Dan in July, was diagnosed with stage four ampullary cancer in 2023, a rare form of the disease related to the digestive system.

Christopher Kapessa, 13, died after the incident in the River Cynon in Fernhill, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in 2019. The inquest heard another boy, then 14, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pushed Christopher into the water. Christopher, who could not swim, immediately got into difficulty and other children jumped in to help but he could not be saved. Isabella Watts, 18, told South Wales Central Coroner's Court in Pontypridd that Christopher had taken off his shoes, T-shirt and glasses and was standing on a ledge, considering whether to jump. Ms Watts, who witnessed the incident, said the boy who is accused of pushing Christopher into the water was standing behind him. Tom Leeper, counsel to the inquest, asked Ms Watts: ""How did Christopher end up in the water?"" ""[The boy] pushed him... he went into the water, and he was fine for about 30 seconds, and then he started going up and down and waving his arms,"" she said. The court heard that other children at the scene jumped into the water to try to save Christopher, including the boy accused of pushing him in. David Hughes, representing the alleged pusher, suggested Ms Watts's attention had more focused on conversations with her friends, and the boy may have stumbled instead of pushing Christopher. ""He didn't stumble, he pushed him. He was standing still when he pushed him so it didn't look like a stumble at all,"" she replied. On Monday, the inquest heard from one teenager who described seeing the boy push Christopher into the water with his hands. ""I had a clear view of what happened,"" the 17-year-old said. ""Everybody for a few seconds didn't know if he could swim or not and there wasn't a panic, and when people realised he couldn't swim people jumped in to try and help him.

Hannah Blythyn, who is responsible for the fire service, said she is ""not convinced"" the organisation can address the problems identified on its own. ""The issue is not whether the Welsh government becomes involved, but how and to what extent,"" she said. Ms Blythyn made a statement to Senedd members about the report on Tuesday. Last week, an independent review concluded that bosses at the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service tolerated sexual harassment and domestic abuse outside work. Allegations of sexism and abusive behaviour towards staff prompted the investigation, which found ""serious deficiencies in the service"" after surveying more than 450 staff. A report also detailed how the service ""tolerates"" firefighters posting sexualised images in their uniform on adult platform OnlyFans. It followed an ITV news report in 2022 claiming firefighters had kept their jobs despite allegations they had sexually harassed and abused women in the service. The chief fire officer Huw Jakeway has apologised and is stepping down. The minister told the Welsh Parliament: ""When I met the chair of South Wales Fire and Rescue Authority yesterday, it was clear that he is taking the report seriously and accepts all the recommendations in full. But that can only be the start of a long process of reform and cultural change."" ""And I am far from convinced that the authority alone is capable of designing, overseeing and implementing that process. The issue is not whether the Welsh government becomes involved, but how and to what extent."" She added: ""I am ruling nothing out in terms of Welsh government support, direction or intervention in South Wales Fire and Rescue Service. We simply cannot accept this level of discrimination and mismanagement in an organisation charged with protecting people from serious harm"". Ms Blythyn said the retirement of Mr Jakeway, was ""nowhere near sufficient to stimulate and embed the degree of cultural change that is necessary"". She said she was concerned that the ""identified failures"" could affect the delivery of frontline services. ""Individuals who assault, bully, harass and victimise their colleagues are palpably unfit to discharge duties relating to public protection. Staff who experience or witness this kind of treatment, or who see promotion based on nepotism not merit, are very likely to be demotivated, mismanaged and badly led,"" she said. Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives called for independent reviews into the culture at Wales' other fire and rescue services. The minister said she expected those services to read the south Wales report and reflect upon it.","['Wales', 'South Wales Fire and Rescue Service', 'Welsh government', 'Sexual harassment']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1810A/production/_128007589_gettyimages-1325453657.jpg'],['Mark Palmer'],UK,Wales

The criticism, from Andrew RT Davies, came after the first minister stated enforcement action would not be taken against people ""genuinely confused"". Police would ""seek to engage and to educate them"", Mr Drakeford said. Drivers claiming to be confused without evidence to support this should expect to face enforcement action, he said. The outgoing first minister was speaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, a day after enforcement of the policy in built-up areas began. Mr Davies had asked him to explain comments he made in a news conference on Monday, in which he said people ""genuinely confused"" about whether the speed limit applied would not be prosecuted. In Tuesday's First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford said ""the enforcement authorities in Wales will pursue the same policy in relation to 20 mph zones as we became familiar with during Covid, that they will begin with engagement"". ""Where people genuinely do not understand that the law has been broken, then they will engage in education with those people, and they will only take enforcement action when they are sure that that is needed to keep roads and communities safe and where the evidence is of wilfully breaking the law. ""So, what I said was: where people are genuinely confused, then the system will seek to engage and to educate them. ""Where people claim to be confused but there is no evidence that confusion lies at the root of their behaviour, then they cannot expect that enforcement action will not be taken."" Mr Davies responded: ""That's as clear as mud, isn't it, first minister?"" Commenting later, he said Mr Drakeford had seemed ""genuinely confused"" by his policy. In the Senedd, Mr Davies accused Welsh Labour ministers of making ""a bad piece of law"" that was ""actually more confusing and more dangerous"". ""Ultimately, this piece of law should be withdrawn and common sense prevail,"" he told Mr Drakeford. But the first minister said Mr Davies should be ""deeply ashamed"" by ""his suggestion that it is somehow legitimate to break a law simply because you think it is a bad law"". ""What he intends to do is to encourage people to believe that if you think a law is a bad law, somehow it is legitimate for you to break it."" The Conservative Senedd leader denied that this was what he was doing. In Monday's news conference, Mr Drakeford said police would enforce Wales' 20mph law when people drive ""well above"" the speed limit. He also admitted there have been ""anomalies"" in signage. His transport minister Lee Waters said on Monday that ""for now"" prosecutions will start at 26mph in a 20mph zone.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67912939,NHS: GP says private care can help cut waiting lists,A doctor who has opened a private GP surgery says the private sector can help ease the pressure on the NHS.,2024-01-09,"A doctor who has opened a private GP surgery says the private sector can help ease the pressure on the NHS. Dr Beth Howells had worked in the NHS for nearly 20 years before leaving recently to begin a surgery on the Ceredigion/Carmarthenshire border. She believes there will be an expansion of private primary healthcare at a time when GP services are under pressure. The Welsh government said it was up to individuals if they wanted to use private health care instead of the NHS. Last year, Dr Howells returned her NHS contract and opened her own surgery in Newcastle Emlyn. Dr Howells said people opted to pay for a private GP as they felt they could not wait two or three weeks for a GP appointment at their NHS practice. She believes that her role as a private GP will take some of the pressure off the NHS, at a time when GP services are in the headlines. Figures from the British Medical Association (BMA) show that the number of patients per full time equivalent GP in Wales have gone up from 1,676 in 2013 to 2,210 in 2022. ""It's difficult to predict the future and how things will evolve and where the demand will be,"" said Dr Howells. ""But I personally think it's impossible for the NHS to provide everything to everybody. ""The population has expanded enormously, people are living longer due to good health care, which means that there will be a role for additional services which the NHS will not be in a position to offer."" BMA Wales said doctors leaving the NHS for the private sector was ""a symptom of... the impact of chronic underinvestment in general practice over a number of years"". It added: ""Welsh government must commit to a reversal of this underfunding and restore NHS general practice to its place as the foundation of a high-quality, cost-effective health system."" The Welsh government said it had provided financial incentives to attract GP trainees to speciality training schemes in mid, north and west Wales, ""areas which, historically, have been difficult to recruit for"". After more than 32 years in the NHS, nurse Neris Davies has decided to move to the private sector due to the pressure. Ms Davies said she dreaded going to work while in the NHS as she felt she was constantly playing catch-up with her work. ""People would come in quite irate because you were behind time and, as a nurse, I wanted to give patients the time that they needed. ""So going home was also frustrating because you felt that you haven't given your best and it's hard to switch off from that. Since changing surgeries last year, she said she felt happier coming to work and feels the pressures are not the same. On the streets of Newcastle Emlyn, people were both interested and reluctant in paying for a GP service. Alex Baker, 24, said: ""If it was life or death and you can't get to A&E and there's a GP you have to see. But if it's for something that isn't major, then no."" But Iris Rush, 76, added: ""If you need to see them, then you do what you have to. So if I had to pay, I'd have to pay."" Oliver Evans, 31, believes more needs to be done to improve access to NHS GPs. ""If it comes to it, everybody will have to pay for private healthcare and that's why we have to protect the NHS,"" he said. ""If everyone had the money, they would go and do it. But at the end of the day, the NHS is what makes this country Great Britain, to a certain extent, it's one of our greatest achievements. ""It's a necessity to have your healthcare. So if it's pushed in that direction, us as a working class won't have a choice, will we,"" he said. The Welsh government said it wanted people ""to be able to access GP services on the NHS in Wales as quickly as possible, based on need"" but it was up to individuals if they wanted to go private instead.","['Wales', 'Newcastle Emlyn', 'NHS Wales', 'Health', 'General practitioners (GPs)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F297/production/_132230126_drbethhowells.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1765A/production/_132243859_nerisdavies.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EA7/production/_132253102_oliverevans.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']",['Dafydd Morgan'],UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67921442,Why Wales' tidy mouse loves 'mousekeeping',"It has gone viral, captured worldwide attention and been dubbed Welsh Tidy Mouse after being spotted on camera keeping a shed spick and span.",2024-01-09,"It has gone viral, captured worldwide attention and been dubbed Welsh Tidy Mouse after being spotted on camera keeping a shed spick and span. But why is this meticulous mouse so keen on keeping things squeaky clean? Experts say it is probably enjoying building a nest, dragging items back to somewhere it considers safe. So we could even say the domestic little creature captured on camera by Rodney Holbrook in Builth Wells, Powys, is doing a spot of mousekeeping. The retired postman repeatedly found objects he had left out tidied away overnight and said the tidying ritual had been going on for two months. ""It might be that the mouse is actually finding this rewarding,"" said Megan Jackson from the University of Bristol. ""It does look like maybe the mouse is scouting out its environment to find things that it think might be useful for a nest and bringing it back to a place that seems to be safe,"" said Ms Jackson. She studies motivating behaviour and uses mice in her research. Mr Holbrook believes the mouse is using the objects to hide away nuts. The camera captured it picking up clothes pegs, corks, nuts and bolts. ""Mice are like the magpies of the rodent world,"" Cardiff-based pest control expert Gareth Davies said. ""They just collect things and hoard them because they think they're prepping for the future and hard times,"" he added. Mr Holbrook has nicknamed the decluttering rodent Welsh Tidy Mouse, to avoid confusion with another mouse spotted keeping a shed in order in Bristol in 2019. Mr Davies said he did not believe the mouse was tidying, but rather making a ""secure area and hoarding everything that could be useful in the future"". ""They'll collect anything,"" he said, adding he once found 40 metal bottle tops in a box. Ms Jackson said mice were ""really cognitively complex"". ""They can learn loads of new things and this mouse has clearly learnt something because it is making that association with the box,"" she said. In her research, she has looked at foraging behaviour in mice for nesting material and seen very similar patterns, with mice collecting nesting materials and dragging them back to a box that seems safe. ""That behaviour is really robust, really intrinsic to mice. We see it repeated a lot,"" she said. She did acknowledge the case of Welsh Tidy Mouse was ""definitely an interesting one"". ""Some of the objects that were described don't really sound like things that would be good for building a nest,"" she said. ""Typically a mouse would want something that forms a really good structure and then something that would help keep it warm,"" she added. Mr Holbrook said he thought it was possible that the mouse enjoyed putting the objects back in the box. The mouse seemed indeed to be exhibiting rewarding behaviour, Ms Jackson said, as the behaviour was being repeated. ""The mouse must know the nest -  if it is a nest - is being disturbed every day, but it is still enjoying taking the objects back to the box,"" Ms Jackson said. While the tidying arrangement is currently working in Mr Holbrook's favour, Mr Davies said he would advise him to seek professional help as mice can breed quickly. ""You don't want them to start chewing electrical cables and water pipes and causing mayhem,"" he said.","['Wales', 'Builth Wells', 'Mice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/63BC/production/_132223552_annml_mouse_tidy_10_low_res.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/159C/production/_132223550_annml_mouse_tidy_08_low_res.jpg']",['Antonia Matthews'],UK,Wales

Denbighshire council's licensing committee will meet to decide whether the Millbank in Rhyl should be allowed to continue operating. Alleged incidents included one customer being left unconscious outside the pub, with another being reportedly strangled and punched. North Wales Police said the pub failed to uphold the licence conditions. These include preventing crime and disorder, ensuring public safety, preventing public nuisance and protecting children from harm. Consequently, North Wales Police want a review of the premises licence. North Wales Police said there was a report of a common assault involving a customer being grabbed by the neck and threatened in September 2023. Police officers said they also attended a public order incident on October 29, 2023 involving staff members and customers. Officers then reported drunk people and two males on the floor outside, one unconscious and bleeding from a wound to his head. After reviewing the CCTV footage of the incident, police officers said both staff and customers were involved. According to a licensing report on the council's website, police said they believed there was disorder over a dispute relating to drinks at the bar. This escalated and there was fighting. On 5 November, 2023, police said a fight inside the premises led to one person being strangled and punched. Police said they believed that the premises were not appropriately managed, and asked for consideration given to revoking the licence. The licensing sub-committee can modify the conditions of the licence, exclude a licensable activity, remove the designated premises supervisor, suspend the licence for a period not exceeding three months, or revoke the licence completely. Denbighshire's licensing committee will debate the issue on Monday.","['Wales', 'Denbighshire County Council', 'Pubs', 'Rhyl']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A843/production/_132257034_millbank.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']",['Richard Evans'],UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67915922,"Wales needs powers to set new tax rates, says Plaid Cymru","Wales needs powers to introduce more income tax bands, the leader of Plaid Cymru has said.",2024-01-09,"Wales needs powers to introduce more income tax bands, the leader of Plaid Cymru has said. Rhun ap Iorwerth said he wants people who earn less to keep more of their wages and people who earn more to pay more. The Member of the Senedd for Ynys Mon set out his economic ideas in a speech in Cardiff on Tuesday. The Welsh Conservatives claimed it would result in higher taxes for the poorest in Wales. The Plaid leader also called for a Westminster Economic Fairness Bill to impose fair funding for Wales. Neither that, nor powers over tax bands, can be implemented without help from a larger party in Westminster. Currently the Welsh government can only vary the rates the UK government sets. That is unlike the the Scottish government, which has used powers to create new tax bands to adjust how much people pay according to how much they earn. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr ap Iorwerth said: ""What I'm saying is that we need to be able to target the people who can pay more, and to do so in a fair way, people who are on higher wages."" ""In order to be able to plan ahead for a taxation system that works for Wales, we need to have that flexibility."" He would not give specifics on who should pay more. He added:  ""I want a more progressive tax system so that people who are earning least are able to keep more of their wages. ""I'm calling for us to be able to use them, yes. ""What I can't talk about is what exactly the thresholds will be because we were not able to do that without having the powers in the first place. ""Scotland is a good example of the kind of thing that we might want to do in Wales, but we can't talk about those kind of things now."" Mr ap Iorwerth said a law passed in the Commons was needed to address ""Wales' underfunding"". There are long-standing complaints that Wales should have received billions as a result of the HS2 railway line, which was classed as English and Wales despite ending in Birmingham. The UK government provides most of the cash needed to run Welsh government services and invest in infrastructure, with a smaller proportion raised from tax. The amount is determined by the Barnett formula. Plaid argues that Wales' funding should be based on its needs. A recent report by the Welsh government's chief economist said public spending per head in Wales was lower than Scotland or Northern Ireland, but higher than England overall and most English regions. In his speech, Mr ap Iorwerth, who became party leader last summer after the resignation of Adam Price, said Wales has a ""persistent underperformance"" that needs to be addressed. ""Creating a fair society should be an ambition for all of us, collectively,"" he said. ""We shouldn't rest until we can look around our communities and see that no-one is being left behind."" Andrew RT Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""Plaid Cymru has borrowed the Scottish nationalist playbook on taxation, and the outcome will be higher taxes for the poorest in Wales. ""As we have seen in Scotland, people on higher wages will consider leaving if tax rates aren't competitive with other parts of the UK, and the outcome will be a higher tax burden on the lowest earners.""","['Wales', 'Income tax', 'Plaid Cymru', 'UK devolution']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CDEB/production/_128851725_06940935-c0d9-4a2f-8747-a2721e44c863.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14D4C/production/_131342358_plaidcymrulogobbc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']",['David Deans'],UK,Wales

Corrine Brown, 33, was left with a collapsed lung after the attack but Darren Brown, 35, told Cardiff Crown Court it was ""a blur"". She was said to have been comforting their 18-month-old daughter when the assault happened. Mr Brown denies attempted murder at the couple's home in Wildmill, Bridgend, on 10 July last year. He previously pleaded guilty to a charge of wounding with intent. Giving evidence Mr Brown, who sat on Bridgend council as an independent until his resignation last September, accepted he had stabbed his wife. But he said he picked up a knife from the kitchen and went upstairs to ""try and frighten her"". He repeatedly denied remembering stabbing his wife in their child's bedroom and in the bathroom. On accepting he had intended to cause his wife serious bodily harm Mr Brown became emotional. ""I was confused, I couldn't believe I could do such a thing,"" he said. He told Kevin Seal, defending, he neither intended to murder or kill his wife. The same month as the attack the couple had agreed to split after 10 years of marriage but decided to remain living together until the mortgage was paid. Ms Brown had recently begun seeing another man. The court heard Mr Brown had placed a voice-activated camera in his wife's bedroom. She knew it was in the room, he said, but not where it was. ""I was paranoid I would come home and she and the children would be gone,"" Mr Brown said. When cross examined by James Wilson, prosecuting, Mr Brown said of the attack: ""It's a blur. ""I just wanted to hurt her. I didn't want to kill her."" Asked by the judge why he hadn't said before he could not remember the attack, Mr Brown said he did not know. He added through tears: ""She's the mother of my children. I'm ashamed."" Earlier the jury were shown blood-spatter photos of the toddler's bedroom, landing and bathroom. Expert witness Martin Beale told the jury the images were consistent with Ms Brown being at these locations while injured and bleeding. He said there were signs  of a possible attempt to clean up the blood stains. Forensic physician Prof Jason Payne-Jones confirmed Ms Brown was stabbed three times in the back and suffered a collapsed lung on the left. Each injury, the court heard, was 2.5cm (1in) wide. Prof Payne-Jones added in order to cause a collapsed lung on average a weapon must penetrate the chest by at least 3-4cm. Showing the jury the 18cm blade used in the attack he said the depth of the stab wound was about 6cm. The court heard the blows came from from the side or back. Ms Brown's hands, Prof Payne-Jones said, showed injuries typical of defensive wounds. It would be, he said difficult to inflict these oneself. Previously Mr Wilson told the jury Mr Brown told police his wife's wounds were self-inflicted.

Mr Drakeford said police in the first instance would ""make sure people are aware of the law [and] their obligations"". ""Where people deliberately break the law, where people drive well above 20mph in a 20mph zone, then the law will have to be enforced."" He added: ""I think if the police find somebody driving above 20mph and the reason is they are genuinely confused about that - I don't think in those circumstances of genuine confusion the police will move to enforcement. ""If there are examples, genuine examples, where people just have misunderstood that this piece of road that they are on is now a 20mph limit, I think that will be resolved through the way that the police intend to respond. ""But it would need to be genuine confusion, rather than just a claim to be confused."" He said suggested there are ""anomalies"" in the implementation of the law. ""We recognised that from the beginning,"" he said. ""Some of them are to do with signage, and whether the signage is clear enough."" The two candidates to be the next Welsh Labour leader have said they would launch a review of the law if elected - and Mr Drakeford said that had been committed to by the Welsh government from the beginning. He added: ""In Wales, people do observe the law. They may not have learned to love it… but they are abiding by it."" Mr Waters wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""after giving over three months to get used to it the police are starting to enforce"". Mr Waters, the deputy climate change minister, described the police approach to enforcement as ""education led"", adding that ""there's no incentive for us to fine because the money won't stay in Wales"". A Welsh government spokesperson clarified that the money generated by 20mph speeding fines, ""as with all speeding fines, is directed to HM Treasury"". Mr Waters, who has transport in his portfolio, also wrote: ""Police guidelines say enforcement will be targeted on drivers travelling 10% above the speed limit - plus 2mph. ""For now this will be increased to 10% plus 4mph meaning we start to prosecute at 26mph in a 20mph limit."" He also said a review is looking at ""how the limit is being implemented"" and ""whether local authorities are confident in using their powers to exempt some stretches of road that would be better at 30mph"". In introducing the law, Welsh ministers argued the limit would reduce deaths and noise and encourage people to walk or cycle. A petition to axe the new default limit has gained just under 470,000 signatures since it was launched in September, the most in the Senedd's history. Organisers of the campaign called on the Welsh government to ""rescind and remove"" the ""disastrous"" law. The Senedd Petitions Committee is due to consider the topic for debate as the petition has received well over the 10,000 signature threshold. As of Monday morning, the number of signatures was above 467,000. Welsh Conservatives said they were in favour of a 20mph limit outside schools, hospitals and care homes - but called the rollout ""disastrous, frankly ludicrous and a war on motorists"". South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said ""common sense will be applied"". ""It's not as if there's a will to make life difficult for drivers,"" he said. Mr Michael told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that people who did not want it needed to recognise it was now law, and use their common sense in the way they drive. ""This is now the law, let's make it work,"" Mr Michael said. He stressed the police wanted to engage the public, rather than spend all their time on enforcement. ""This is a speed limit that was introduced by Welsh government because of the strong evidence that it would save lives and reduce injuries,"" Mr Michael said. He acknowledged that there were complications with the introduction of the law and said it was sensible that there would be a review of the implementation. ""I think there are issues in some places where there's a lot of switching between different speed limits,"" he said. Drivers have also complained of unclear road signage. ""All of that will work through in time,"" Mr Michael said. He also pointed out that road safety changes have frequently been unpopular in the past. ""Every law that's been brought in order to improve safety on the roads - whether you go back to motorcycle helmets, whether you look at seatbelts - has had a degree of controversy at the beginning, before people get used to it,"" Mr Michael said.","['Wales', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/44E5/production/_125873671_sign.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EBF0/production/_130700406_5f444507-e0ac-4c8e-bf9d-26a9f37c3ba4.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['David Deans', 'Antonia Matthews']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67911288,Christopher Kapessa: Drowned boy's family 'racially abused',"Family members of a teenage boy who drowned were beaten, urinated on and run over in the lead up to his death, an inquest has heard.",2024-01-09,"Family members of a teenage boy who drowned were beaten, urinated on and run over in the lead up to his death, an inquest has heard. The mother of Christopher Kapessa said the family had been subjected to years of racial abuse since moving to Wales. She added that the family received hate mail and had their home in Rhondda Cynon Taf daubed in racist graffiti. Christopher, 13, died after being pushed into the river Cynon in 2019. The High Court in 2022 upheld the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision not to charge a 14-year-old boy who allegedly caused the teenager's death. Christopher's mother, Alina Joseph, told the inquest the family lived in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, until 2018 and suffered ""horrific treatment"" and ""felt very isolated"". She said they received ""racial hate letters"" and racist language had been written on the outside their home. The court in Pontypridd heard of incidents over a number of years where she said her children were allegedly beaten, urinated on and run over. She said they were reported to police but no action was taken. Ms Joseph's statement described her son as her ""treasure"" and said she would ""fight for justice for him"". She said Christopher ""wasn't a confident swimmer"" but had done ""basic swimming lessons"". The inquest heard from a teenage boy at a river on the day Christopher died, who described the ""panic"" as a group of friends realised he could not swim. The 17 year-old - who cannot be named because of his age - said he had joined friends at the river, at which time ""10-plus"" people were there, including Christopher. The plans to meet at the river had been made on social media, he added. He said that at the time he did not know whether Christopher could swim and did not jump into the river because he ""didn't want to get into the dirty water"". Asked about the moment Christopher was pushed into the water, the teenager said: ""Everybody didn't know if he could swim or not, there was no immediate panic. ""As soon as everyone realised he couldn't swim, they was panicking, people jumped in to try and help."" Asked what Christopher was doing in the water, he said: ""He was flailing, trying to keep himself above the water, struggling."" Asked whether there had been any barriers or fencing preventing them from accessing the bridge, the teenager said it was ""out in the open"". He added that it appeared to be ""out of use"", however, and the murky water underneath meant it was not possible to see the bottom of the river. The inquest heard that in a police interview following the incident, the teenager had said that he may have heard the boy who pushed Christopher jokingly tell him moments before: ""I'll chuck you in now."" Asked how certain he was of what he had heard, however, the teenager said he didn't remember, although he had ""clearly"" seen the push itself. The teenager explained how he then got on his bike and went to the nearest hospital to try to find help. The barrister representing the boy who allegedly pushed Christopher into the water, David Hughes, told the court that his client was one of the first to jump into the water to try and help. Questioning the teenage witness, Mr Hughes said they didn't accept that a push happened and suggested that his client had slipped into Christopher. The teenager said that was possible but added: ""My thoughts are it was a push which wasn't meant with any malice but it was more playful."" The court heard that Christopher would have turned 18 two days ago, on 6 January. The CPS had decided not to bring a charge as it claimed he pushed Christopher as a ""foolish prank"". Christopher's family accused the CPS and South Wales Police of institutional racism for not prosecuting the suspect. When the decision not to charge the 14-year-old was reviewed, Jenny Hopkins, who oversees the appeals and review unit within the CPS, said: ""Although there was evidence to support a prosecution for manslaughter it was not in the public interest to prosecute."" The inquest is expected to last for up to two weeks.","['Wales', 'Hirwaun', 'Mountain Ash']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A661/production/_108039524_ecb9fdb0-6fd0-4a06-92f1-2d8684f65255.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1370/production/_118767940_alina.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Wales

They were told he had a ""bright future ahead of him as a boxer"" and that ""his eyes were fixed on boxing and nothing else"". There were flowers arranged as a pair of boxing gloves and others spelling out the word ""champ"" in the hearse. Mourners heard that Morgan was ""loving and caring"" to his mother, father, siblings, other family members and friends. His family said that they had ""never got to say goodbye"" and thanked the community for the support they had received since Morgan died.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67897576,"Foster carer numbers in Wales need to increase, say local councils","There is a massive need for more foster carers in Wales, say local authority foster services.",2024-01-09,"There is a massive need for more foster carers in Wales, say local authority foster services. Foster Wales, the network representing fostering teams, said there were more than 7,000 children in the care system, but only 3,800 foster families. The group said it wanted to tackle ""misconceptions"" to reach a target of recruiting 800 foster households over the next two years. The Welsh government said it was committed to increasing the number. Emma and Joanna Johnston from Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire, started fostering last January. Joanna has older children from a previous relationship and the couple knew they wanted a family together. ""I moved down to Wales from England to be with Jo around six years ago, and I'd always wanted children in some capacity,"" said Emma. ""Jo has her own biological children who've grown up and fostering was the natural thing for us to do. ""It's something that I've always wanted to do. I didn't necessarily want biological children of my own and I wanted to help children who were in need."" Emma and Jo, who are both teachers, said the experience could be challenging but ""hugely rewarding."" Jo said: ""You do worry if the child is going to settle. But you're so keen to help them. ""We've been on loads of different adventures in the fresh air, to see what she likes. It was so great to see her enjoying and showing her parts of Wales she hadn't seen before. ""She's integrated into the family really well."" Jo said they wanted to give back to children who needed support. ""We've worked in different roles with children and young people for the past 20 years, and we wanted to give back to children who needed help and support. We want to try and help those children overcome what they've been through in the past."" The couple have both gone part-time in their work, but said every situation was different. Emma said: ""There isn't a set plan that works for everyone, it depends on your own circumstances and the children that are placed with you. ""It's more than possible to work full-time but it depends on the individual circumstances."" Figures from Foster Wales showed 53% of young people in care were aged 11 or over. The organisation said it wanted to encourage people to consider fostering a teenager. Jo and Emma have fostered a 12-year-old girl and Jo said there were ""so many misconceptions that need to be addressed"". ""You can help them by talking to them about how they're feeling,"" Jo said. ""You can do things together and find common hobbies, whereas with a younger child you might not be able to do those things."" Foster Wales agreed there were key ""misconceptions"" stopping potential carers from wanting to foster, including a lack of confidence and ability to support a child in care, the belief that fostering does not fit with certain lifestyles and the misconceptions around the criteria to become a carer. The head of the Foster Wales network, Alastair Cope, said everybody could bring something to the table through local authority fostering, adding: ""I think it's about providing that love and that stability in the interim."" He said the key aspects were providing love and a ""stable home life"" before they may go back to live with birth families or move on to a longer-term foster family. Mr Cope said a change in Welsh government policy meant there was a need to increase the number of people registered as local authority foster carers. ""There are agencies that operate on a profit-making basis out there at the moment,"" he said. ""Welsh government have committed to by 2027, removing profit from anything around children's services, and obviously that includes fostering."" Mr Cope said by that point there needed to be more foster carers able to accept children. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to increasing the number of foster carers in Wales. ""We are working closely with our national fostering scheme, Foster Wales, to help local authorities ensure that there is a readily available supply of dedicated, trained, diverse and well-supported foster carers who can provide a stable and caring family environment locally for our children and young people.""","['Foster care', 'Cross Hands', 'Children', 'Wales', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F641/production/_132214036_fostering_getty_skate_boy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8111/production/_132214033_foster1-emma-jo.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175A5/production/_101535659_teens_sofa_texting_getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['Aimee Thomas', 'Megan Davies']",UK,Wales

An independent review of the way Covid was dealt with on the Isle of Man has made 31 recommendations. Alfred Cannan said it was an ""important report"" that would ""take some time to digest"". ""It is crucial that we have a comprehensive understanding of its findings and recommendations,"" he said. The review by Kate Brunner KC said, while there were ""areas of weakness"" in the government's response, overall it had been ""largely successful"". The report outlined ""some significant issues"", including inadequate emergency planning, too much focus on following the UK initially, educational recovery not being appropriately prioritised, and insufficient attention paid to borders, which allowed an outbreak in early 2021 via the ferry firm. It also highlighted the social care sector was not well-supported. Of the 142 Covid deaths on the island, 51 died in care homes while a further 11 care home residents died in hospital. There were 40 outbreaks in care homes, with one at Abbotswood in April 2020 leading to the deaths of 20 residents. The review found that outbreak ""in all likelihood, occurred with no fault on the part of the home"", and there had been a ""lack of attention paid to care homes in government planning"".

The review covered the period from December 2019 up to the removal of restrictions in April 2022, and looked at areas including border closures, quarantine procedures and online learning. The document said a mass vaccination plan should now be drawn up and consideration given to how testing capacity could be increased rapidly in the event of another pandemic.

Sir William Hillary founded the charity after being inspired to take action after witnessing several shipwrecks of the Manx coast while living in Douglas. A service at St George's Church, where he was buried in 1847, marked the start of the charity's 200th anniversary. RNLI chief executive Mark Dowie said the island would ""always have that very special place"" in its history. Mr Dowie said the island remained a ""critical element"" of the service and Sir William ""would recognise today the service that he intended to create in 1824"". He said: ""We've come on an awfully long way obviously in terms of technology and the way we do things, but essentially the service is the same and that is an amazing achievement within 200 years."" The church service featured hymns and readings, including the Lifeboat Prayer, which was read by representatives of the island's five lifeboat stations, followed by a wreath laying at Sir William's tomb. The service was organised by volunteer Emily Heaton, who passed out as Douglas lifeboat station's first female coxswain on an all-weather lifeboat late last year. She said to be the first female to take on the position at the founding station was ""truly quite special"". ""To be doing it in the same waters is that really special link to the birthplace of the RNLI,"" she added. The event was part of a series of events to mark the anniversary on the island, which will continue in with a year-long exhibition at the House of Manannan, which is due to be opened in February.

It follows on from a 5% rise in 2023, which was the joint highest increase imposed on tenants over the past 10 years.The increases would also make sure ongoing repair costs to the public sector housing network could be met, the department said. People who have their rents met by the Manx government as part of social security benefits will be reassessed to take the new costs into account, it added.Infrastructure Minister Tim Crookall said the rise would ""enable further investment in the 6,200 public sector properties across the island"".He said: ""Building materials, fees, labour and other expenses have all increased in price and it’s vital that this is taken into consideration alongside concerns around affordability for tenants.""Anyone struggling to meet the additional cost is urged to contact their housing provider to create a repayment plan.

People without local residential qualifications can live in open market properties. The Environment and Infrastructure Committee (E&I) is creating new criteria for adding properties. Former Deputy Chief Minister Mark Helyar said he was ""slightly concerned"" at the decision. E&I has the power to add any local market property to the open market register. Its President Lindsay de Sausmarez said her committee was still working on the new criteria. Deputy Helyar asked E&I a number of questions, which it responded to explaining the committee's position. He said: ""There is a great deal of speculation about this issue. ""As far as I'm concerned, the response doesn't correspond with Guernsey law, but lawyers of course often disagree. ""I'm slightly concerned that the decision to unilaterally suspend legal rights appear to have been made purely it seems on a small group of politicians personal dislike of local residents making a profit, it does, however, seem to chime with other socialist anti-profit policies such as GP11."" GP11 is a policy which requires all planning applications for more than 20 units of accommodation to provide up to 30% of developable land for affordable housing purposes. Deputy de Sausmarez said it was ""incredibly important"" a new policy was developed, so the open and local markets could be protected. She added: ""The committee - like all States members - is mandated to act in the best interests of the island, and protecting the housing market from the risk of instability is inarguably in the best interests of the island, especially right now when housing is rightly such a priority. ""I'm sure, as the political lead for the Treasury until just a few weeks ago, Deputy Helyar would be strongly supportive of any additional revenue that can be raised fairly and effectively. ""The new policy will include a levy on what is an entirely voluntary process which, even after any such levy, would likely result in a meaningful profit for the successful applicant."" She said it was the right thing to do to suspend new applications to the open market. Mrs de Sausmarez added: ""We need a policy in place to define what is an open market property and what qualifies as that part of our market has a really important role. ""It is there to make sure the local market remains as affordable as possible for local residents. It's also an economic enabler."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

Alan Witney-Price, boss of Sark Electricity Limited (SEL), said the scheme would lead to higher power prices than those charged by his company. The government has been presented with plans for a new grid at a cost of £8.6m, which would include a 30m (98ft) wind turbine and a solar farm. Sark's Policy and Finance Committee (P&F) has been contacted for a response. An independent report in 2021 stated Sark's current electricity infrastructure needed a ""complete overhaul"" because of what it described as ""serious health and safety concerns"". Mr Witney-Price said he is willing to improve it, but requires the permission of the island's government - Chief Pleas - to progress, something he said he hasn't received. Sark's Seigneur Major Christopher Beaumont said the current grid needed replacing: ""It doesn't matter who does it, somebody has to replace the electricity system in Sark."" Mr Witney-Price described plans for another grid which would be in competition with his company's as ""nonsense"". He said: ""We'll have a competitor in the market which wants to charge more for electricity than I do, which is going to make my life easier. ""Having a competitor which will charge more than you is never a bad place to be. ""Chief Pleas haven't talked to me about this, because they don't want to. ""The Government wants to own the power company regardless.""

Aircraft expected to take off for Southampton, Gatwick, Guernsey and Madeira between 07:00 and 09:00 GMT were delayed. Jersey Airport said on social media the runway was inspected and cleared to reopen at about 10:40 GMT. The Jersey Met Office has issued an orange warning for light to moderate snowfall until Wednesday morning. The BBC's Richard Spalding said about 120 departing passengers were affected by the delays. He said he saw airport staff, including a fire engine, driving around the airport relatively easily, with only a few centimetres of snow on the ground. The airport de-iced the runway and used snow ploughs to clear the area. The last time Jersey saw significant snowfall was in 2013, when more than 14cm (5.5 inches) of snow was recorded. While main roads are clear, officials have urged islanders to travel with caution, and those travelling to the airport should allow extra time for the journey but can check in as usual. BBC reporter Julie Flanagan said: ""I think it's easier for motorists to make their way to work than pedestrians. ""The people I've spoken to are finding it more treacherous underfoot, the motorists are saying the road is pretty clear but it is bumper to bumper. Traffic isn't moving fast at all today."" States of Jersey Police have warned drivers about the icy conditions, adding people should leave extra time for journeys and expect delays. The force said: ""When icy conditions prevail, firstly, think about whether your journey is necessary and, if you do have to drive, think about your speed as braking distances can increase tenfold on ice compared with a dry road. ""For this reason, you should leave up to 10 times the normal recommended gap between you and the car in front."" The spokesperson added: ""Remember that tyres grip less efficiently in cold conditions. So even if the temperature is above zero and there's no ice on the road, you should take extra care."" Residents and visitors have been advised to check the latest weather forecasts and advice. The States has also asked people to check on vulnerable family, friends and neighbours in the cold weather.

More than two decades of injustice. But it is a Christmas holiday TV drama that has catapulted the plight of hundreds of sub-postmasters to the top of the political agenda. More than that, it has accelerated the likely timeline for significant change. The government is now saying publicly it hopes that as soon as later this week it can bring forward a plan. An idea that is being explored is passing a new law that would exonerate the hundreds of sub-postmasters desperate to clear their names. Senior folk I speak to in government fret about two elements of this idea: firstly, intervening in the judicial process isn't what MPs are conventionally meant to do. Secondly, they worry about it creating a hostage to fortune: an unintended consequence for a future, currently unforeseen separate issue. But there is a growing feeling that the public mood, prompted by the drama, leaves those in government with no alternative but to act, be seen to act, and to do so quickly. And so government lawyers have been exploring the possibility of carefully written, very specific legislation to specifically address the Post Office scandal, and nothing else. Significantly, two former justice secretaries, the Conservative Sir Robert Buckland, in a letter to The Times, and Labour's Lord Falconer, talking to the BBC, have said a new law is needed and would command widespread support. The current Justice Secretary, Alex Chalk, is examining the practicalities and legal niceties of what is possible. Meanwhile, the breadth and longevity of the decades-long failures over all this mean plenty of people face plenty of questions. For Fujitsu, the Japanese company that built the computer program, Horizon, at the heart of the scandal. For the Post Office's chief executives during the period: John Roberts, Adam Crozier, Moya Greene and Paula Vennells, who was the Post Office's Chief Executive from 2012 to 2019. Over a million people are demanding, in a petition, that Ms Vennells is stripped of her CBE. Plenty of MPs, from the prime minister down, are sympathetic. Ms Vennells has said she is 'truly sorry' for the suffering caused by the Post Office - which, we should remember - the government owns outright. And for the former ministers, some Labour, some Liberal Democrat and some Conservative, responsible for the Post Office since 1999, when this can all be traced back to. Sir Ed Davey is one of them, a postal affairs minister during the coalition government, now the Liberal Democrat leader, facing intense scrutiny in a general election year. Those questions will continue, but there now appears to be a momentum around change, and trying to deliver it quickly. After all these years, hundreds of sub-postmasters are watching, waiting and hoping that - finally - justice might be getting closer.","['ITV', 'Ed Davey', 'Alex Chalk', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10211/production/_132256066_1f57e93bedebbbcfaac4dc1254f46adcd82d29ac0_0_3000_20001000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ADB1/production/_132256444_mr_bates_itv_shutterstock.jpg']",['Chris Mason'],UK,Politics

The prime minister apologised for not declaring Akshata Murty's shares in Koru Kids after appearing before MPs. It followed an investigation that found he inadvertently broke parliamentary rules on declaring financial interests. Downing Street confirmed Ms Murty donated her shares in the firm to charity last month. Rachel Carrell, chief executive and founder of Koru Kids, said Ms Murty had believed in its childcare ""mission"" but ""this message was lost in the media attention surrounding this investment"". ""As we move into 2024, we need to ensure that school-age children are not left behind in any new plans that materialise from the government's levelling up plans for childcare, without any distractions for our business,"" she added. Ms Murty also wound up her start-up investment firm, Catamaran Ventures UK, last month and donated the shares to charity. Companies House records indicate Ms Murty has held shares in Koru Kids, a London-based childcare provider, since 2019. Her shareholding was thrust into the spotlight last year, after Mr Sunak failed to mention it when he was quizzed about the government's childcare policies at a Commons committee in March 2023. Koru Kids was one of various childcare agencies that stood to potentially benefit from a childminder bonus scheme announced at that month's Budget. The rulebook for MPs says they should be ""open and frank"" about ""relevant"" financial interests when speaking in Parliament, including those of family members. It led to an investigation by Parliament's standards commissioner, who concluded he should have made the MPs aware of his wife's connection to the company. He concluded that the prime minister had confused parliamentary transparency requirements with ministerial ones, but added that the rule breach ""appears to have been inadvertent"". Mr Sunak had argued that he had disclosed the shares to civil servants, and he was not required to put them on his public ministerial list of interests as they were not directly relevant to his job as PM. In letters to the commissioner, he said his wife only held around 1% the company's shares and had no decision-making role. But he later accepted he should have more ""explicitly"" declared the shares in correspondence with the committee after his appearance.",['Rishi Sunak'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15B5E/production/_132262988_murtygetty.jpg'],['Paul Seddon'],UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67930783,Tory group of MPs aim to force changes to Rwanda Bill,"A group of Conservative MPs, led by former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, will try to force changes to the government's flagship Rwanda Bill.",2024-01-09,"A group of Conservative MPs, led by former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, will try to force changes to the government's flagship Rwanda Bill. The bill seeks to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to the east African country. The group, believed to number about 40 MPs, say the changes will ""strengthen"" the law and stop people smuggling into the UK via small boats. Mr Jenrick said ""the Bill as drafted simply will not work"". He is backed by former prime minister Liz Truss, former home secretary Suella Braverman, former party leader Iain Duncan Smith and former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg. The amendments are expected to be tabled early next week At least nine former Cabinet ministers are thought to be supporting four amendments. Those backing the amendments want to significantly reduce the circumstances in which a migrant can make an individual claim to challenge the validity of being sent to Rwanda. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) blocking flights. The amendments are extremely unlikely to attract enough support in the Commons to pass. The key question is how many of those who support them would be willing to vote against the government's plans if they remain unamended. Ministers will also have to decide if they themselves adopt some of the ideas being put forward to try to attract greater support from some of their MPs on the right of the Conservative Party. But some on the left, in the One Nation Group of Tory MPs, are insistent the government must not change the bill. Would-be rebels backed off voting against the Bill on its second reading before Christmas. More than 20 Tories abstained but threatened to vote against it if there were no changes. A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour. But that is thought to be unlikely to happen until the crunch vote in the final stages of the Bill, when it will be clear if the Government has granted any concessions. Meanwhile, a move by Labour trying to force ministers to publish documents relating to its Rwanda policy has been defeated by 304 votes to 228. The unamended Rwanda bill seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send asylum seekers to, after the Supreme Court ruled the policy was unlawful in November. The legislation orders British judges and courts to ignore some sections of the UK Human Rights Act. Asylum seekers would still be able to challenge their removal to Rwanda based on their personal circumstances. But ministers could ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. It stops short of providing powers to dismiss the whole of the ECHR. Mr Jenrick, who resigned as a minister over the government's approach to the Rwanda scheme, said: ""The stakes for the country could not be higher. ""If we don't fix this bill the country will be consigned to more illegal crossings, more farcical migrant hotels and billions more of wasted taxpayers' money in the years to come. ""If the government truly want to stop the boats, it should adopt these amendments and use parliament's power to deliver on the repeated promises we have made the public."" The amendments are designed to close off legal challenges by migrants to deportations. Under the proposed changes, any injunctions by the ECHR would not be treated as binding on the government. The amendments would also expand so-called ""notwithstading"" clauses, which allow the bill to override other conflicting laws that could interfere with deporting people to Rwanda. Downing Street have previously called the bill ""the toughest legislation ever introduced to Parliament"" and says it ""makes clear that this Parliament, not any foreign court, is sovereign"".","['Robert Jenrick', 'Rwanda']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/21F6/production/_131849680_71e87bb3-11d8-4f40-bd0f-8abcc9f442e0.jpg'],['Sam Francis'],UK,Politics

Alex Chalk told MPs there would be further announcements shortly. But he said the government wanted to exhaust ""all alternatives before taking radical action"". More than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted based on information from the faulty Horizon IT system. Some went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, while many were financially ruined. In the Commons, former minister Nadhim Zahawi called for a ""simple bill"" to quash all the remaining convictions based on ""bad data"". ""Until those convictions are overturned the victims cannot claim compensation,"" the Conservative MP said. In response, Mr Chalk said the issue was ""an appalling injustice"" and Mr Zahawi's suggestion was ""receiving active consideration"". Other senior figures to call for legislation to speed up the process of overturning the convictions include Labour peer Lord Falconer, who was justice secretary under Tony Blair, and former Conservative justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland. Sir Robert told the Commons that in ""a perfect world"" victims of the scandal would have their cases individually assessed. However, he added: ""The scale of this miscarriage of justice is enormous and there are understandably hundreds of victims who do not want to come forward because they've lost faith in the process."" Conservative MP Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said legislating to overturn convictions would be ""unprecedented"". He urged the justice secretary to ensure he was satisfied the existing appeals process ""may not be capable of delivering justice within an acceptable timeframe"". Mr Chalk replied: ""That is precisely the point…. Of course we would not want to stray into the normal lane of the judiciary."" He added: ""This is wholly unprecedented. We will want to have exhausted all alternatives before taking radical action."" Some have raised concerns that quashing convictions through legislation would amount to Parliament interfering with the independent judicial process. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve told the BBC such a move was ""a short cut"", which ""may leave some people dissatisfied that they haven't really been fully exonerated"". Mr Chalk has been meeting senior judges to discuss potential ways to overturn convictions more quickly. Another option would be a mass appeal, with cases dealt with together, rather than individually. In 2021, for example, 39 former Post Office workers had their convictions quashed in one go. But such a case could still take years to resolve. To date only 93 convictions have been overturned and of these only 30 people have agreed ""full and final"" compensation settlements. An ongoing public inquiry is looking into the scandal, which has been described as one of the biggest miscarriages of justice the UK has ever seen.

Newspaper owner Evgeny Lebedev was appointed to the House of Lords in 2020 by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Baroness D'Souza told a parliamentary committee she didn't understand his role in the House and that he had only attended twice since his appointment. The BBC has approached Lord Lebedev for a comment. Lord Lebedev, who owns the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, was nominated to the House of Lords for philanthropy and services to the media. Son of a former KGB officer, he was born in Russia but move to the UK as a child. He holds Russian and British nationality. In 2022, he responded to criticism of his peerage, using a piece in the Evening Standard to say: ""I may have a Russian name but that makes me no less a committed or proud British citizen than anyone else in this country of ours."" Baroness D'Souza, who served as the Lord Speaker in the House of Lords between 2011 and 2016, was giving evidence to the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The House of Lords has frequently attracted criticism for the size of its membership, which currently stands at 784 peers, making it the second largest parliamentary chamber in the world. Baroness D'Souza said the numbers were ""a public scandal"" and criticised appointments to the chamber, saying some people did not view it as ""a serious job"". ""Basically what they are doing is treating it as an honour - maybe it is something that gets them a table at a restaurant."" ""There have been appointments, more recently of people who really don't have any role, no perceived expertise, no perceived role and who do not take up any role. ""What about Lebedev for instance? What role does Lebedev have in the House? I think he has been in twice."" Baroness D'Souza suggested reducing the number of peers in the House of Lords by 30% could save about £6m per year. She also questioned if peers could be paid money to encourage them to retire. Later in the evidence session, Lord Burns, chair of the committee on the size of the House of Lords, said the proposal could save money but that it was ""politically toxic"". During the evidence session, SNP MP Ronnie Cowan asked if the numbers could be reduced by getting rid of the remaining 92 hereditary peers, people who inherit their title from their parents. Baroness Hayman, who was Lord Speaker between 2006 and 2011, said the system was ""totally unacceptable"" and added that the current by-election system for replacing hereditary peers was ""bad, mad and wrong"". She also said the appointments process for the House of Lords undermined ""credibility in its performance"". However, she added that the criticism of the quality of the House of Lords' work was ""absolutely minimal"" and that it scrutinised proposed laws better than the House of Commons. She also expressed concern about how much legislation came to the Lords that had not been adequately scrutinised by MPs in the Commons and pointed to the recent Levelling Up Bill as ""an egregious example"". Both baronesses argued that the process for appointing peers to the House of Lords should be changed. Currently, the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac) can make recommendations on appointments but the prime minister has the final say. Baroness D'Souza said the commission should be able to override decisions made by the prime minister. She said it was ""a disgrace"" that the system had not been reformed and that should be a ""matter of priority"".",['House of Lords'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/07CB/production/_132259910_gettyimages-1468587816.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A40B/production/_132259914_gettyimages-462778200.jpg']",['Kate Whannel'],UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/education-67916002,Labour proposes free breakfast clubs to tackle persistent school absence,Better mental health support for pupils would be part of Labour's plans to improve school attendance in England.,2024-01-09,"Better mental health support for pupils would be part of Labour's plans to improve school attendance in England. Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson set out the proposed measures, including free breakfast clubs for primary schools, at an event at the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) on Tuesday. The plans also include increased funding for early speech and language interventions. This week, the government promised to extend the existing attendance-hub scheme to support a thousand more schools in England. ""Every day our children are in school is so incredibly important,"" said Phillipson. ""It damages their life chances when they aren't there. ""So it's about that partnership we need to see between parents and schools, but also between schools and government, because governments have responsibilities as well."" Among Labour's plans to tackle persistent absence is the creation of a national register for home-schooled pupils, designed to track children who are not in mainstream schooling. The proposals also include using Ofsted to review attendance data, and employing AI to spot trends in absence by linking with existing records in other services such as social care. Ms Phillipson told the BBC these measures would be funded by ""ending the tax breaks that private schools enjoy"". Department for Education (DfE) data shows more than one out of every five children in England are persistently absent from school - double the proportion before the Covid pandemic. Persistent absence means missing at least 10% of school days - about four full weeks from the academic year. A CSJ report last week suggested more school sport could help, but also found some parents thought children did not need to be in school full-time. The DfE says parents have a duty to ensure children attend school. On parents' role in improving pupil absence, Ms Phillipson said: ""I think we also have to be clear that parents have responsibilities as well. ""It's about everyone involved working together, pulling together to make the difference that we need as a country because it damages us all. ""When children are not in school, it's not just those children who are missing out, but all of us as a society as well."" Labour's plans are being backed by Sir Kevan Collins, the former school catch-up tsar. Sir Kevan highlighted the impact of the pandemic on school absence and educational attainment, calling the current situation ""a real crisis"". ""Covid has cast a long education shadow and unfortunately, for some children, they're still suffering the consequences of learning loss,"" he told BBC News. ""All too often, the response to the pandemic has been piecemeal and, in my view, half-hearted."" Boris Johnson appointed Sir Kevan in February 2021, to advise the government on helping England's schools recover and create a long-term plan to help students catch up on learning after the pandemic. ""I'm a Labour Party sympathiser but I was happy and honoured to go and support a Conservative prime minister,"" Sir Kevan said. ""We all had to stand up and do our part."" But he resigned a few months later, after the government allocated £5bn in funding, rather than the £15bn he had advised. ""The phrase that was used was that we were 'maxed out on recovery' - and I don't think we ever maxed out on recovery,"" Sir Kevan said. ""We left schools too often on their own to resolve this. ""For too many children in our most vulnerable communities, we failed them and let them down."" On Monday, the government announced £15m worth of investment over three years to address school attendance issues. The DfE promised 18 new attendance hubs - bringing the total to 32 across England - providing tailored support to pupils at 2,000 schools, up from 1,000. The government also plans to provide more targeted and intensive support to more than 10,000 severely absent students and their families. Conservative MP Robin Walker, chair of the education select committee, told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme that the government should focus on the increasing number of students missing up to half their time in school - so-called severe absences. Mr Walker said he supported a public information campaign to inform parents what the ""right conditions"" were for students to stay home because of illness, and when they should go in to school nonetheless. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan called attendance issues her top priority. ""We want all our children to have the best start in life because we know that attending school is vital to a child's wellbeing, development and attainment,"" she said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67913795,"Oil and gas legislation is total distraction, senior Tory says","Plans to guarantee annual oil and gas licensing rounds are ""a total distraction"" which reinforce the idea the UK is ""not serious"" about tackling climate change, a senior Tory has said.",2024-01-09,"Plans to guarantee annual oil and gas licensing rounds are ""a total distraction"" which reinforce the idea the UK is ""not serious"" about tackling climate change, a senior Tory has said. Former minister Sir Alok Sharma said he would not vote for the upcoming Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill. It comes after ex-net zero tsar Chris Skidmore announced he was quitting as a Conservative MP over the legislation. The government says the plans will help strengthen the UK's energy security. It argues the country will still need to use some fossil fuels even after it reaches net zero, and that it is better for this to be produced domestically than imported. However, Sir Alok, who was president of the COP26 climate summit when it was hosted by the UK, said the bill was ""smoke and mirrors"" and ""frankly changes nothing"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the North Sea Transition Authority, which is responsible for issuing licenses, could already do so when it deemed necessary and that this would not change under the new legislation. ""What this bill does do is reinforce that unfortunate perception about the UK rowing back on climate action… and not being serious about meeting our international commitments,"" he said. Sir Alok criticised the government for ""doubling down on granting more oil and gas production licenses"", arguing the time devoted to the bill would be better spent ""pushing forward on plans for a clean energy transition"". He added that the price of oil and gas was set internationally so the plans would not necessarily lower domestic energy bills, while the government could not control whether private companies sold their oil abroad or in the UK. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of 30 MPs, including Mr Skidmore and Conservative peer Lord Goldsmith, have written to Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho urging her to drop the legislation. In their letter, the group said the plans weakened the UK's claim to be a world leader in tackling climate change. ""The most effective way to bolster the UK's energy security is by increasing the supply of low-cost renewables and implementing energy efficiency measures, both of which would genuinely lower consumer bills,"" they wrote. MPs had been due to vote on the legislation in Parliament for the first time on Monday, but the bill was delayed after several debates overran. The Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill is due to return to the House of Commons in the next two weeks. Labour, which has said it would not allow any new oil or gas licenses if it wins power, opposes the plans. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""wasting its time trying to pass legislation to create a dividing line with the Labour Party"" and that it would not make any difference to energy bills. On Friday, Mr Skidmore, who led a government review of net zero, said he could not continue as a Tory MP ahead of the vote. He said the bill would send a ""global signal that the UK is rowing ever further back from its climate commitments"" and in effect allow more frequent new oil and gas licenses. Mr Skidmore has now formally submitted his resignation as an MP, triggering a by-election in his Kingswood constituency. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: ""It makes sense to make the most of our domestic supply, rather than shipping in liquefied natural gas with four times the emissions than domestically produced gas. ""These new licenses will not increase carbon emissions above our legally binding carbon budgets, but will provide certainty for industry, support 200,000 jobs and bring in tens of billions of tax that we can invest in the green transition and support people with cost of living."" Last year Rishi Sunak pushed back some of the UK's climate policies, saying he did not want to impose unnecessary extra costs on the public. However, the prime minister said he was still committed to achieving net zero by 2050, which means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere.","['North Sea oil and gas', 'Alok Sharma', 'Oil & Gas industry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7C5A/production/_132243813_b34ffe6c1d4797d53277e2ffa2f1d0c219eb285d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3EC0/production/_129346061_gettyimages-1148474010.jpg']",['Becky Morton'],UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67893447,Prime Minister's Questions: Which subjects dominated in 2023?,Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face each other at the first Prime Minister's Questions (PMQ) of the year on Wednesday.,2024-01-09,"Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face each other at the first Prime Minister's Questions (PMQ) of the year on Wednesday. Sir Keir will not be short of subjects on which to grill to the prime minister, who does not know in advance what the Labour leader will be asking him. The six questions the opposition leader gets each week at PMQs, when Parliament is sitting, offer a snapshot of the issues dominating the news agenda - and what Labour believes are its strongest lines of attack on the government. In 2023, Sir Keir asked Rishi Sunak about the health service 28 times, out of a total of 198 questions. Immigration and the cost of living tied for second place of most common subjects, at 23 questions each. Our analysis includes questions asked by Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden or former Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, who stood in for Sir Keir and Mr Sunak when they're away. The BBC tracks the topics of questions asked by the leader of the opposition to the prime minister at PMQs. Thirteen of those questions on health were about NHS waiting lists. The prime minister made cutting waiting lists one of his priorities at the start of last year, but waits for non-emergency treatment in England rose to 7.71m in October 2023, almost half a million higher than they were at the start of the year. The government says this is because of strikes by health unions. Six of those health questions were about waits for ambulances - all on the 18 January, shortly after record-worst response figures were published. Twelve of the questions on the cost of living were about mortgage rates, with Sir Keir often criticising the ""Tory mortgage penalty"" in the wake of rate rises following Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022. They came up most regularly in the summer months, when rates were reaching their highest. Mortgage rates peaked at an average of 6.85% for a residential property in August 2023 but have since fallen to below 6%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. On immigration, 14 questions were about illegal immigration - with six of those being about the government's controversial plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. There were 19 questions on policing, crime, prisons and justice, which included questions about the murder of Zara Aleena, the review by Baroness Casey into standards of behaviour and internal culture in the Metropolitan Police, and escaped prisoner Daniel Khalife. Housing was asked about 15 times, with 10 questions on housebuilding, and four about no-fault evictions. The government said it would ban no-fault evictions in its Renters Reform Bill, although indefinitely delayed this in October until after the court system is reformed. General criticisms of the Conservative Party and the government came up 11 times, including when Sir Keir was summarising several topics and the government's record in his final question. It also includes questions about so-called ""sleaze"" and criticisms of Mr Sunak. The schools concrete crisis, Russia-Ukraine war, the Northern Ireland protocol, child poverty, and the BBC were all asked about six times by Sir Keir. Held most weeks when Parliament is sitting on Wednesdays at 12 noon, PMQs is a chance to MPs to hold the Prime Minister to account on topics of their choosing. Last year's sessions lasted for an average of 35 minutes and 3 seconds, according to BBC research. As Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir gets to ask six questions each week. The SNP's Stephen Flynn gets to ask two questions each week, as leader of the third largest party in the House of Commons. Other backbench MPs who want to ask a question enter a ballot, although those not successful in the ballot can attempt to ""catch the speaker's eye"" by standing up in between questions. PMQs used to be held twice a week for 15 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but changed to a longer weekly session by Tony Blair when he became prime minister.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67914916,Greens to stand throughout England and Wales at next general election,"The Green Party is aiming to field candidates in every seat in England and Wales at this year's general election, its co-leader has said.",2024-01-09,"The Green Party is aiming to field candidates in every seat in England and Wales at this year's general election, its co-leader has said. Carla Denyer told the BBC it was already ""good way through"" selecting candidates to fulfil the aim, which would mark a first for the party. She said her party was open to talks with other parties about possible electoral pacts. But she ruled out withdrawing candidates unless other parties do too. The Greens are aiming to translate the record gains they made at last year's English local elections into increased representation at Westminster. Their only current MP, two-time former leader Caroline Lucas, is due to stand down at the next general election, which is almost certain to take place this year. Despite plans to stand in every constituency, Ms Lucas's Brighton Pavilion seat is among a handful of constituencies where the party plans to focus its resources. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Denyer said other targets include Bristol Central, a newly-created constituency largely replacing the Labour-held Bristol West seat, where she will be the party's candidate. The party is also targeting two more traditionally Tory areas: North Herefordshire and Waveney Valley, another newly-created seat straddling the border between Norfolk and Suffolk. Standing throughout England and Wales would require fielding 575 candidates, 103 more than at the 2019 election, when it stood in 472 constituencies across both countries. At the last election, the party struck an anti-Brexit pact with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, which saw them agree not to stand against each other in dozens of seats. It followed a series of locally-struck deals with the Lib Dems at the 2017 election that saw Green candidates stand aside in various constituencies. But that so-called ""progressive alliance"" led to a backlash within the party, with some figures arguing Labour benefitted most despite not agreeing to withdraw any candidates itself. Some figures within the party have argued that fielding a full slate of candidates would prevent local Green parties coming under pressure from Labour to stand down. And at its autumn conference last year, party members voted to ""maximise"" candidate numbers, with an ambition to stand in every English and Welsh seat. ""The Green Party is collaborative by nature. We're always keen to work with people on areas where we agree,"" Ms Denyer said when asked about possible election pacts. But she added: ""We're not about to roll over and hand over any unilateral gifts to other parties. ""Our position is that our door is open, it's always open, and we are prepared to talk to other parties, but we're not going to be standing down unliterally. ""If there is an opportunity to co-operate, we're open to that, and we've always made that clear so I think the other parties know it. ""But in the meantime, we are standing candidates in every single seat, so that everyone has the opportunity to vote Green."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said his ""working assumption"" is the next election will take place in the second half of 2024. The Greens had its best ever set of local elections last year, gaining more than 240 seats across England. A large part of that success came from targeting rural, traditionally Conservative areas. In Brighton and Hove, though, they lost almost two thirds of their seats, delivering the council into Labour control. Ms Denyer sought to dampen expectations ahead of this year's local polls in May, cautioning that the ""absolute number"" of any potential gains would be limited by the smaller number of councils being contested this time round. The Greens are currently polling at around 6%, behind Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats. The Scottish Greens, a separate party, have been sharing power with the SNP since 2021, following elections to the devolved Scottish Parliament.","['Carla Denyer', 'Green Party (England and Wales)']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1545F/production/_132253178_denyergetty.jpg'],"['Paul Seddon', 'Helen Catt']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67912689,"National Insurance: Is Jeremy Hunt right about £1,000 saving?","Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the cut to National Insurance would be worth: ""nearly £1,000 for a typical two-earner family"".",2024-01-09,"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the cut to National Insurance would be worth: ""nearly £1,000 for a typical two-earner family"". He was speaking to Today on BBC Radio 4 about the change that saw National Insurance (NI) come down by 2p in the pound, from 6 January. But the level of income at which people start paying tax has been frozen. Once you take this into account, the benefit from the NI cut is considerably lower. We asked the Treasury how the chancellor worked out this figure and were told it was based on the saving for a family with two people on the average wage for a full-time employee. The average wage for a full-time employee is about £35,400. The ""nearly £1,000"" figure excludes the impact of other tax measures. In particular, the level of income at which people start paying NI and income tax has been frozen in the UK - since July 2022 for NI and since April 2021 for income tax. The freezes mean more people pay taxes and more people pay higher rates of tax than would have happened if these tax thresholds had gone up in line with rising prices. Independent economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that if you factor the freeze in for April 2024, then the average earner would be saving £130 a year instead of £450 from the NI cut. And if you take into account all the freezes the government has implemented since 2021, then that worker would be just about getting back as much as they're losing this year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which makes economic forecasts for the government, expects the personal tax measures implemented in 2021 and 2022 to raise an extra £44.6bn in 2028-29, while the 2p cut in NI will give back £10bn of that. Some of the levels at which people start paying other rates of income tax are going up in Scotland in April. Mr Hunt talked about a ""typical two-earner family"". We do not know how many households have two members earning £35,400, but £70,800 between them may not be typical. For example, around 30% of working adults are part-time workers, according to the 2021 Census, who have an average annual income of about £12,500 before tax. The average income for a household was £35,000 in 2022 before taxes and benefits are taken into account, according to the Office for National Statistics. The £1,000 was also used by the Treasury press release titled: £1,000 yearly tax cut for households from today.

It said it was the first time it had ""opened a project working with people seeking sanctuary in the UK"". The Home Office said asylum seekers at Wethersfield already had access to medical support. The charity, also known as Doctors without Borders, and the medical team Doctors of the World (DOTW) had set up outside the base and said asylum seekers ""tell us their specific health needs are not being met for various reasons"". It added: ""The men we've spoken with have told us they feel isolated and alone, and that their mental health has worsened since they have arrived at the former military base."" Last month, the charity Care4Calais said it would take High Court legal action against the Home Office, over its use of the remote base as asylum accommodation. MSF has, since 2016, also treated some of the thousands of people seeking asylum in large-scale containment sites on the Greek islands. Dr Javid Abdelmoneim said: ""Many of the men held in Wethersfield will likely have experienced violence, war, arbitrary detention and other trauma and will require tailored and specialised healthcare. ""We know from our work around the world that harsh deterrence policies, such as holding people seeking sanctuary in mass containment sites, is a recipe for disaster which ultimately costs lives.

The vote also demands ministers reveal cash given and set to be given to the East African country. In addition, Labour wants to see the full memorandum of understanding ministers reached with Rwanda. The scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda was first announced by Boris Johnson in April 2022. The plan has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda from the UK so far. MPs will further consider the government's legislation which aims to revive the policy next week. Sir Keir Starmer's party also want the government to publish papers revealed by the BBC which suggest Rishi Sunak had initially wanted to scale back the scheme when he was chancellor in 2022. Those documents were prepared in No 10 when Boris Johnson was trying to persuade Mr Sunak to sign off on the plan. On Sunday Mr Sunak denied ever doubting the policy would work, saying it was his job as chancellor to ask ""tough questions"" about the cost of every policy that crossed his desk. He said it was ""wrong"" to suggest that he did not ""believe in the scheme"". Labour wants to force the vote on Tuesday afternoon as part of an opposition day, which allows the party to choose a subject for debate. The vote will take the form of a Humble Address - which technically means parliament is asking the King to compel the release of the documents, making the vote binding on the government. The opposition are optimistic that some Conservative MPs will back the motion - although it would be extremely unusual for the government to suffer a large enough rebellion to lose the vote. Tuesday's parliamentary gambit will force a Home Office minister to come to the Commons to justify the government's position on Rwanda before the next phase of parliamentary debates and votes on the Safety of Rwanda Bill, which would state that Rwanda should be considered a safe country under British law along with other provisions designed to put the policy on a stronger legal footing. The bill is expected to return to the Commons this month, most likely next week, with several factions of the Conservative Party uneasy about the plans - some fearing they may go too far, others believing they do not go far enough. Speaking at an event in Accrington on Monday, the prime minister said he would welcome ""bright ideas"" on how to improve the bill, but insisted ""my entire party is supportive"" of the legislation. He said: ""If people have bright ideas about how we can make this more effective whilst complying with our international obligations and retaining Rwanda's participation in the scheme… then of course, I'm open to having those discussions."" Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, told the BBC: ""It is totally unacceptable that the Conservatives have refused to come clean on the full costs of the failing Rwanda scheme. ""So far, costs are apparently rising to £400m of taxpayers' money with more home secretaries than asylum seekers sent to Kigali. ""The Conservatives should stop dragging out this chaos and come clean about the real costs and problems."" A government source said: ""We have already declared £240m that has been paid in our partnership agreement with the Rwandan government and one payment of £50m to come in April. ""After that the shadow home secretary's figures are her guesswork and for commercial sensitivity reasons we have not outlined any other potential payments that are all predicated on getting flights to Rwanda, which we are determined to do to stop the boats."" The source added: ""Labour don't like our plans, but really don't have anything at all to offer that would realistically tackle this now-global challenge of illegal migration.""","['Refugees and asylum seekers', 'UK immigration', 'Rishi Sunak']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0EAB/production/_131955730_sunakcapture.png'],['Henry Zeffman'],UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67923190,Paula Vennells: Ex-Post Office boss was shortlisted to be Bishop of London,"Ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells was shortlisted to be Bishop of London in 2017, sources have told the BBC.",2024-01-09,"Ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells was shortlisted to be Bishop of London in 2017, sources have told the BBC. The Rev Paula Vennells is an ordained Anglican priest but does not hold a senior position in the Church of England. The Archbishop of Canterbury pushed her application and was seen as a supporter of her, two of the sources added. It comes as Ms Vennells said she would return her CBE amid the fallout of the Horizon scandal. She ran the Post Office when it routinely denied there was a problem with its Horizon IT system. More than 700 Post Office branch managers were prosecuted based on information from the faulty software, which made it look like there was money missing from their sites. Some went to prison following convictions for false accounting and theft, while many were financially ruined. Ms Vennells has long faced questions over her role in the scandal, which has been described as one of the most widespread miscarriages of justice the UK has ever seen. But the issue is back in the spotlight following an ITV drama, which was broadcast last week. Ms Vennells was interviewed for the role of Bishop of London - the third most senior in the Church of England - but not appointed from a final shortlist of three. She was still chief executive of the Post Office at the time, eventually standing down in 2019 - the same year she was awarded a CBE for services to the Post Office and to charity. There had been growing calls for her to be stripped of her honour, with a petition passing more than one million signatures this week. On Tuesday Ms Vennells said in a statement she was returning her CBE with ""immediate effect"". ""I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system,"" she said. She added that she would continue to focus on cooperating with an ongoing public inquiry into the issue. Ms Vennells was ordained in the Church of England in 2005. She stepped back from her role as an associate minister in the St Albans diocese in 2021 amid intensifying controversy about her Post Office career. Sarah Mullally, who was formerly England's chief nursing officer before she became a priest, was announced as the first female Bishop of London in December 2017 instead. A spokesperson for the Church of England said: ""We never make any comment on who is a candidate, or not, in what is a confidential discernment process."" Before joining the Post Office in 2007, Ms Vennells worked for beauty brand L'Oréal and hospitality business Whitbread. Ms Vennells started as a group network director, then became managing director in 2010 before being promoted to the position of chief executive in 2012. She held the top job until February 2019, when she stepped down amid anger over the Horizon scandal. Ms Vennells took over as chair of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in April of the same year, but later stepped down, around the same time as a group of former sub-postmasters won a court case to have their convictions quashed.","['Post offices', 'Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/991B/production/_132259193_gettyimages-1055764876.jpg'],"['Henry Zeffman', 'Harry Farley']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67908791,Post Office scandal: Former minister calls for mass appeal against convictions,"Hundreds of sub-postmasters convicted in the Post Office Horizon scandal should be able to submit a mass appeal, a former cabinet minister has said.",2024-01-09,"Hundreds of sub-postmasters convicted in the Post Office Horizon scandal should be able to submit a mass appeal, a former cabinet minister has said. Sir David Davis, who is seeking to question ministers about the issue, told the BBC there was ""no real reason"" why there could not be a ""mass case"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has also said all cases need to be revisited. It comes as ministers met on Monday to consider ways of clearing the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 Post Office branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on the faulty Horizon software. Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined. Some have since died. It has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history, but to date only 93 convictions have been overturned and of them, just 30 people have agreed ""full and final"" compensation settlements, meaning many victims are still fighting to clear their names. Some 54 cases have resulted in either a conviction being upheld, people being refused permission to appeal, or the person appealing having withdrawn from the process. While the scandal has been public knowledge for some time with a public inquiry ongoing, an ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which aired last week has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. Speaking to the BBC, Sir David said the drama had galvanised the response to the scandal. ""There are now tens of millions of people who care about this - care a lot,"" he said. ""They're furious in many cases."" At present, all cases are considered individually, but Sir David said: ""All of the cases depend on one single lie, and that is nobody but the postmasters and mistresses could access their computers. We now know that to be untrue. I see no real reason, no logical reason you can't have a mass case, mass appeal on that basis."" Sir David and Labour MP Kevan Jones are among those hoping to scrutinise a minister in the House of Commons, which is reassembling on Monday for the first time since the Christmas recess. Sir Keir Starmer, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, has said that all convictions need to be looked at again, and prosecution powers should be taken away from the Post Office. Sir Keir said: ""I used to run the Crown Prosecution Service, we've prosecuted for other departments, we can do it here - that should be done straightaway. ""And these convictions, the remaining convictions need to be looked at en masse."" The Post Office, which is wholly owned by the government, acted as the prosecutor when it brought the cases against its sub-postmasters. It has the power in England and Wales to do so, and its appointed lawyers presented the evidence in court. The situation is different in Scotland and in Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the government is reviewing options, including stripping the Post Office of its role in the appeal process, and is also looking at how to speed up the compensation process, amid concerns it has been far too slow. On Monday, a petition calling for the former Post Office chief executive, Paula Vennells, to lose her CBE over the scandal passed more than one million signatures. The prime minister's spokesman said Mr Sunak would PM would back committee in Post Office honour probe if it decided to look at revoking Ms Vennells' CBE. Tracy Felstead and Janet Skinner, sub-postmistresses who were both jailed in connection with the scandal, told the BBC Ms Vennells should relinquish her CBE. ""To be fair, and if she had any decency she would just hand it back,"" Ms Skinner said. Ms Vennells has said previously that she remains ""truly sorry for the suffering caused to wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and their families"". She said: ""I continue to fully support and focus on co-operating with the [public] inquiry and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further while it remains ongoing."" Ms Felstead also said she would like to see ""someone held accountable"". ""We were classed as criminals by the Post Office,"" she said. ""Now it is their turn to be investigated and find out who knew what, why and when this all happened."" The Metropolitan Police is now investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. The advisory board overseeing compensation for victims also renewed a call on Monday for all Post Office staff wrongly accused of theft and false accounting to have their convictions overturned. Its chairman, Prof Chris Hodges, told the BBC: ""We've come to the conclusion that the obvious thing to do is the right thing to do, which is for parliament to pass a very simple act, overturning all of them."" He argued that overturning all convictions would not encroach upon the independence of the judiciary ""This is not a situation in which anyone would complain that the government is breaching anyone's human rights,"" said Prof Hodges. He added that he would be ""very surprised"" if the judiciary ""weren't as angry and indeed embarrassed about the situation as we all are, so I don't think that there is a constitutional issue"". Last month, Prof Hodges said that while ""a small minority"" were ""doubtless genuinely guilty of something"", it would be ""worth acquitting a few guilty people (who have already been punished) in order to deliver justice to the majority"". However, former sub-postmistress Ms Felstead told the BBC that while the process of helping former sub-postmasters needed to be sped up, she cautioned against a mass exoneration. ""I think we need to be really careful that we're not just going to go and turn everybody's convictions over, just in case you have that one person that has committed a crime and you've just turned over their conviction,"" she said. A Post Office spokesperson has previously said it shares the ""aims of the public inquiry to get to the truth of what went wrong in the past and establish accountability"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-67763457,The candidates set for Wellingborough by-election,A by-election will be held in Wellingborough following a recall petition in the Northamptonshire constituency.,2024-01-09,"A by-election will be held in Wellingborough following a recall petition in the Northamptonshire constituency. The petition was prompted by Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons for six weeks for breaching the code of conduct for MPs. The date of the election is due to be confirmed when Parliament returns in January. So far, the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, and Reform UK have confirmed their candidates. Britain First has indicated it will also contest the by-election. Mr Bone could stand again, but it would be as an independent, as the Conservatives have suspended him. Candidates are listed in alphabetical order by surname. The Liberal Democrat candidate was born in Northamptonshire and grew up in the county. She joined Northamptonshire Police in 1985 and rose to the rank of inspector, serving across the county - including in Wellingborough - and she supervised the tactical firearms team. Ms Savage Gunn helped run security for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and later became a law enforcement consultant in the US, before her return to the UK and Northamptonshire. When Covid-19 broke out she retrained as a health care assistant and worked in her mother's care home, before becoming a Covid clinic co-ordinator in the county. She continues to work at the care home, and is a trustee of Northamptonshire Carers, in Wellingborough. Note: Gunn is used as the candidate's primary surname, hence she appears at the top of the alphabetical list. The candidate for Reform UK is the party's co-deputy leader and a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Brexit Party. Reform UK, previously the Brexit Party, was co-founded by Nigel Farage in 2018. Mr Habib is a property developer and fund manager, and previously a donor to the Conservatives. The 58-year-old said: ""I intend to give the Wellingborough by-election the best swing of my bat and if I am elected I will stand in the Commons and hold this wretched government to account to the very best of my ability."" Ms Harrison represents the Oundle ward on North Northamptonshire Council and is executive member for Adults, Health and Wellbeing on the authority. She also previously ran for Parliament in 2017 in the Derbyshire constituency of Bolsover. Ms Harrison said: ""I am delighted to have been selected as the candidate for Wellingborough. ""As the local candidate, I am best suited to deliver for the people of Wellingborough, having already done so on a local authority level."" She is also the partner of Mr Bone, who was first elected to the seat in 2005. Labour's candidate grew up in Northamptonshire and went to John Hellins Primary School in Towcester, and Kingsbrook secondary school - now Elizabeth Woodville School - in Roade. She has worked in the charity sector her whole career. In 2019, she stood as prospective parliamentary candidate for Labour in the South Northamptonshire constituency - losing to the Conservatives' Andrea Leadsom. After her selection in November, the Ms Kitchen said: ""Residents here are already telling me that they're fed up with the state of the town centre, anti-social behaviour blighting our high streets and the 8am scramble for a GP appointment. ""Labour has a plan to tackle these issues that impact so many here, but I will start by giving Wellingborough a voice in Westminster and working hard to restore pride in our town and villages."" Mr Morris, lives in Bozeat in the south of the constituency, having previously lived in Wellingborough, and works as an insurance underwriter. The 55-year-old has been a member of the Green Party for five years and has stood as the party's candidate for North Northamptonshire Council in Irchester and Rushden South. He has also served on Bozeat Parish Council for three years. Mr Morris said: ""What Wellingborough needs is a representative who knows and cares about local issues, rather than someone concerned with furthering their personal agenda in the national political arena. ""Local matters will always come first for me."" He has two children, aged 21 and 17, and is a season ticket holder at Northampton Saints. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Conservative Chris Skidmore formally quit as an MP for Kingswood, Bristol, over the government's energy plans. The seat was held by Labour until the 2010 general election. Members from the party, which has not announced its candidate, said they will be fighting hard to overturn a 11,000 Tory majority. The government announced the oil and gas bill in November, in a bid to draw a dividing line with Labour, which has said it will not issue new licences if it wins power. Ministers say the legislation, which will fix yearly North Sea fossil fuel licensing in law, will help improve the UK's energy security. But in his resignation statement Mr Skidmore said: ""We can not expect other countries to phase out their fossil fuels when at the same time we continue to issue new licences or to open new oil fields. ""It is a tragedy that the UK has been allowed to lose its climate leadership, at a time when our businesses, industries, universities and civil society organisations are providing first-class leadership and expertise to so many across the world."" The formal resignation was handed in by Mr Skidmore on Monday. The Bristol Labour Party, which has begun canvassing in Kingswood, said: ""The Tory majority in Kingswood is more than 11,000 so this will not be easy but we will be giving the campaign everything we have got."" Commenting on Mr Skidmore's resignation, Jeremy Hunt has said he disagrees with his reasoning. The Conservative chancellor said: ""It is very sad to lose a respected colleague like Chris Skidmore. ""But I do profoundly disagree with the reasons that he gave for resigning."" One Kingswood resident, who wanted to be remain anonymous, said: ""It's a bit of a shock. ""I think it's sad but I admire him for standing down for his beliefs though. I'm afraid I don't know who I will vote for in the by-election."" Another said they were ""very disappointed"" Mr Skidmore had quit. ""I think he's been quite good around here,"" she said. ""I think people should know well in advance who the candidates should be. ""I will vote in both the by-election and the general election."" Mr Skidmore had already announced he would not stand as an MP at the next election. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said it was an ""embarrassing mess for Rishi Sunak,"" showing voters ""simply don't trust the Conservatives on the environment"". Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said it left the government's green credentials ""in tatters"". All parties are yet to announce candidates for the position.

Ms Vennells has been urged to forfeit her honour in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful prosecution of Post Office staff. The Forfeiture Committee can recommend honours are stripped if a person has brought the system into disrepute. Ms Vennells has apologised to Post Office staff. Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister shares the public's feeling of outrage on this issue. He would strongly support the Forfeiture Committee if it chose to review the case. ""It is a decision for the committee, rather than the government."" A petition addressed to senior civil servant Sir Chris Wormald, the chair of the Forfeiture Committee, calling for Ms Vennells to lose her honour has attracted more than one million signatures. The committee - which is made up of a Treasury solicitor and four independent members - can submit a recommendation for forfeiture through the prime minister to the King, who is the only person who can annul an honour. The committee does not give an opinion on whether a person is guilty of a particular act, only on whether the honours system has been brought into disrepute. An individual can also apply to have their honour voluntarily forfeited. Ms Vennells, who was Post Office chief executive between 2012 and 2019, has said previously that she remained ""truly sorry for the suffering caused to wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and their families"". She said: ""I continue to fully support and focus on co-operating with the [public] inquiry and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further while it remains ongoing."" Justice Secretary Alex Chalk met Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake on Monday to discuss how to help the convicted branch managers clear their names. MPs will hear a statement from Mr Hollinrake later. Ms Vennells was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) - an honour given to those making distinguished or notable contributions in a specific field - by the Queen in the 2019 New Years Honours for ""services to the Post Office and to charity"". Prior joining the Post Office in 2007, she worked for beauty brand L'Oréal and hospitality business Whitbread. Ms Vennells started as a group network director, then became managing director in 2010 before being promoted to the position of chief executive in 2012.

Ms Vennells took over as chair of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in April of the same year, but later stepped down when a group of Post Office operators won a High Court case in which their convictions were ruled wrongful and Horizon to be at fault. Their ruling was upheld on appeal in 2021. More than 700 Post Office branch owner-operators were wrongly prosecuted for theft, fraud and false accounting between 1999 and 2015 on the basis of faulty information from Horizon software. Some were imprisoned, others were pushed into bankruptcy and some have since died. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who was postal affairs minister from May 2010 and February 2012 during the coalition government - joined calls for Ms Vennells to have her CBE revoked. ""It shouldn't have been given in the first place,"" he said. ""The [Forfeiture] Committee needs to meet to make that decision.""

She also called for Ms Black, the SNP's deputy leader at Westminster, to ""live up to her responsibilities or give the post over to someone who will"". Ms Black, who has been contacted for comment, made her ""comfortable"" remark on Times Radio last week. She said the culture of Westminster meant MPs lost touch with reality. Ms Black has already announced that she will be leaving Westminster at the next election and has previously described the House of Commons as an ""outdated, sexist and toxic"" working environment. The Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP cited safety concerns, social media abuse and unsociable hours as she explained her decision. She has also recently spoken to the BBC of her struggles with imposter syndrome, the term given for a psychological state where people doubt their skills and accomplishments and have a fear of being seen as a fraud. In the interview last week she went on to criticise colleagues in the House of Commons, who she said had settled too comfortably into life at Westminster. ""I've seen folk who you would have thoughts would have been the first one marching to the border with a claymore but now absolutely love being in London. I wouldn't have expected that,"" she told Times Radio. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland on Monday, Ms Cherry, said she believed the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn was doing a great job but criticised Ms Black's comments. ""When he made Mhairi his deputy he gave her a position of great responsibility, particularly in an election year when so many of her colleagues are facing difficult fights to hang on to their seats and I don't think it's appropriate for Mhairi to be attacking her colleagues in public,"" she said. ""She needs to live up to her responsibilities or give the post over to someone who will. ""And I am hoping that Mhairi will apologise to her colleagues this week."" Ms Cherry denied that she or her SNP colleagues were ""too comfortable at Westminster"" and defended their policy of sitting and voting in the House of Commons. ""The SNP is not an abstentionist party and if Mhairi wants to change that policy then she needs to put the work in to do it,"" she said. ""At the moment my constituents expect me to be present at Westminster and representing them there in relation to important issues such as the Post Office scandal."" And she defended her own record of working with MPs from other parties. ""It's not easy being an opposition member of parliament at Westminster but if you work and if you are present there and if you build alliances then you can achieve successes,"" she said. ""I've shown that in the past when I've built a cross-party alliance to stop Boris Johnson's unlawful prorogation of parliament and many of my SNP colleagues have had significant successes in relation to other issues ""But it's hard work doing that.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-67759402,Peter Bone: How Wellingborough ended up with a by-election,"Following a recall petition triggered by MP Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons,",2024-01-09,"Following a recall petition triggered by MP Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons, a by-election will be held in Wellingborough. How did the Northamptonshire constituency end up without an MP and having to go to the polls? The 71-year-old has been active in Conservative politics since the 1970s, but did not make it to Parliament until 2005, when he won the Wellingborough seat. In 2019, he had a majority of 18,540 in the constituency. A prominent Brexit-supporter, he campaigned with Nigel Farage in the 2016 referendum. Also a leading voice on the right of the Tory party, he briefly served as deputy Commons leader under Boris Johnson. He was known for jokey references in Parliament to his wife Jenny (""Mrs Bone"") - but the couple split in 2016 and he is reportedly in a new relationship. Mr Bone made frequent media appearances and notable interjections in the Commons, such as raising the issue of flies in Rushden and breaking protocol by wearing a hat to promote a local charity. Mr Bone was suspended for six weeks following an inquiry into his behaviour earlier this year. An investigation by Parliament's behaviour watchdog, the Independent Expert Panel, found Mr Bone broke sexual misconduct rules by indecently exposing himself to a staff member during an overseas trip. It also upheld five allegations of bullying, including verbally belittling, physically striking and throwing things at the staff member. The alleged victim told the BBC ""physical, emotional and psychological abuse"" by the MP left him a ""broken shell of the young man I once was"". Mr Bone has denied the allegations and returned to the Commons - after his suspension - to vote on the Rwanda bill. A recall petition lets voters remove an MP between general elections. It is triggered if an MP is convicted of a crime or suspended from the Commons for more than 10 days. If 10% of voters in the constituency sign the petition, the seat becomes vacant. This petition was open for six weeks from 8 November to 19 December and was backed by 10,505 people - which equates to 13.2% of the electorate. It means a by-election is due to be held this year. It is not known whether Mr Bone will stand but if he does it will be as an independent. The Conservative Party has selected Helen Harrison as its candidate, Gen Kitchen will be standing for the Labour Party and Ana Savage Gunn will represent the Lib Democrats. Will Morris is the Green Party candidate for Wellingborough and Reform UK has selected Ben Habib for the by-election. Britain First has also indicated it will contest the by-election. A date for the by-election has not yet been set and constituents will have to wait until Parliament sits again in January to find out when it will be. The BBC has a list of candidates who have said they would be standing for election and it will be updated once the formal election process gets under way.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67924012,EDF Energy aims to extend life of UK nuclear plants,EDF Energy has outlined plans to extend the lives of its operational nuclear power stations in the UK.,2024-01-09,"EDF Energy has outlined plans to extend the lives of its operational nuclear power stations in the UK. The French state-owned firm said it would make a decision on whether to extend the lives of four UK plants by the end of the year. It is also looking at the possibility of running its Sizewell B plant for 20 years longer than scheduled. The plans are subject to approvals by safety watchdogs and would equal about £1.3bn in investment if approved. The firm revealed its investment plans for its UK nuclear fleet on Tuesday and said in a statement that it hopes to boost energy security and cut carbon emissions. In 2022, nuclear power provided 13.9% of total electricity supplied in the UK, although that figure has been in decline since the 1990s, according to official data. Like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. But nuclear power stations do not produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane during their operation, although the construction of new plants is costly and does generate a low level of emissions through the manufacturing of materials needed like steel. The government has said in the past that it wants nuclear power to provide up to 25% of the UK's electricity needs by 2050. EDF Energy manages all five nuclear power stations that are currently generating electricity in the UK, along with three that are defueling, the first stage of winding down operations. On Tuesday, Dr Mark Hartley, managing director of EDF's nuclear operations business, said the firm wanted its advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) at the Torness, Heysham 1 and 2, and Hartlepool plants to ""maintain output... for as long as possible"". The company said this would require approval from regulators and would be subject to rigorous safety inspections. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool had been due to close this March, but EDF announced last year they would be kept open until early 2026. The Heysham 2 and Torness power stations are currently due to close in 2028. In its latest update, the firm said it was also looking at the potential for its Sizewell B plant in Suffolk to run for 20 years longer than its scheduled end date of 2035. Sizewell B is built to a different design - a pressurised water reactor, the first of its kind to be constructed in the UK. EDF said that it hopes to take a final investment decision in 2025, but added that ""a sustainable commercial model is necessary"". Overall, its nuclear fleet generated 37.3 terawatt hours of electricity in the UK last year. It marks a drop of about 15% when compared with the year before, partly due to station closures. It hopes to maintain this level of output until at least 2026. But the older generation of nuclear power stations designed in Britain and constructed in the 1960s and 1970s are all scheduled to close. ""Obviously safety is paramount, but keeping them running for a few more years certainly has advantages,"" said Prof Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre. ""[While the UK] has enough renewables, gas and interconnection to keep the lights on, keeping these reactors running helps keep carbon emissions down."" In the last two years, the UK's energy security has also come under intense scrutiny after Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a sudden spike in gas prices and in turn a steep increase in electricity bills. ""[Extending the life of nuclear plants] also helps reduce reliance on imported gas, and helps ensure we have a comfortable margin between supply and demand,"" Prof Gross added, although these older reactors ""can't be kept going indefinitely"". Peter Atherton, an independent energy analyst, said the announcement by EDF was ""very good news for the power system"", which is going through a ""huge transition"" at the moment towards renewable energies such as wind and solar power. He also pointed out that while the cost of constructing new nuclear facilities can be enormous, the running costs afterwards are relatively low and they are continuously subject to safety checks once operating. One expert group that includes some vocal opponents of nuclear power, the International Nuclear Risk Assessment Group, said in a report in 2021 looking at ageing nuclear power plants that extensions inevitably increase the risk of accidents, including the release of radioactive substances into the environment. But Mr Atherton said: ""All stations must continually prove that they are safe to operate on a daily basis and that you are operating it safely. Regulators will be on-site, as well as whole teams who check maintenance programmes."" Helen MacInnes, an energy sector analyst, said that the investment by EDF in the ""highly regulated"" nuclear power sector should be viewed positively as the UK tries to move away from fossil fuels. As the government strives to meet its target of reaching ""fully clean"" electricity by 2035, she said that nuclear power would play an important part. Other countries have also looked at investing in nuclear in a bid to diversify their energy mix. France, for example, has some new reactors planned. In the UK, the government has committed to building a new generation of nuclear power stations. Only one - Hinkley Point C - is currently under construction, having faced severe delays during the pandemic and spiralling costs. It is not expected to open before June 2027.","['Energy industry', 'Electricity', 'EDF Energy', 'Torness', 'Hartlepool', 'Nuclear power', 'Heysham', 'Sizewell']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6CED/production/_132258872_gettyimages-1449201665.jpg'],['Lora Jones'],Business,New Tech Economy

The announcement is in the firm's annual report due to be published later. About 1,400 people work at the two sites in Heysham. Heysham is the only site in the UK to have two operating nuclear power stations. Heysham 1 began operating in 1983.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67910944,Energy firms allowed to restart force-fitting prepayment meters,Energy companies have been granted approval to resume force-fitting prepayment meters in people's homes nearly a year after it was suspended.,2024-01-09,"Energy companies have been granted approval to resume force-fitting prepayment meters in people's homes nearly a year after it was suspended. EDF, Octopus and Scottish Power can install the meters again after meeting various requirements set by Ofgem, the industry regulator. For years, energy companies were able to force-fit meters into homes when bills went unpaid. But agents for British Gas were exposed installing them inappropriately. They were forcing their way into the homes of vulnerable people, against Ofgem rules. The scandal emerged early last year after an investigation by the Times newspaper and led to a public outcry. The meters were fitted (or smart meters automatically switched to prepay mode) when people did not pay previous bills, and there was no prospect of payment. It was designed to avoid further debts building up because these meters require gas and electricity to be paid for upfront. Since February last year, no forced installation of meters have been allowed. Ofgem has since drawn up new rules that set out what suppliers are required to do. Under the rules, meters should not be fitted: Any company that breaks the rules would face enforcement action and unlimited fines. They would also be required to refit a standard meter within 24 hours and pay compensation. ""Protecting consumers is our number one priority,"" said Tim Jarvis, director general for markets at Ofgem. ""We've made clear that suppliers must exhaust all other options before considering forced installation of a prepayment meter, and consumers can help themselves by reaching out to their supplier as soon as possible if they think they won't be able to pay their bill, so payment options can be discussed. ""While nobody wants to see the practices uncovered last year repeated, we also know that allowing households to build up unsustainable amounts of debt isn't the right thing to do either."" Campaigners want a total ban on the force-fitting of prepayment meters. Such a ban would need to be introduced by government ministers. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: ""It is outrageous that energy firms are seeking to use the courts to force people onto prepayment meters in the middle of winter. ""We still have grave concerns about the processes energy firms have in place for assessing vulnerabilities."" The inclusion of Scottish Power on the new list of approvals comes after the firm was granted the first new batch of 124 warrants to fit the meters at Berkshire Magistrates Court, sitting in Reading, in October. But Scottish Power later cancelled a few of the warrants when it emerged that mothers of children under two were among those subject to the warrants, with one mum having given birth just a few weeks before, according to an investigation by the Times in November. A further hearing has been held since but in any case, even if warrants are granted, they cannot be acted upon until Ofgem give final approval. Scottish Power, EDF and Octopus have now been given that status. Octopus said, despite the permission, it had no plans to start again. ""Even before the ban, Octopus had only ever carried out involuntary installations in extremely rare circumstances - indeed, we've only carried out 32 such installations, ever. In every case, customers had not paid anything for at least six months, and had refused to respond to at least 40 communications,"" a spokesman for the company said. ""As such, we currently have no plans to restart involuntary installations of prepayment meters."" A Scottish Power spokesman said: ""While we have met Ofgem's strict criteria and been authorised to restart involuntary prepayment meter installations, where appropriate, this is always a last resort. Our focus will continue to be on supporting our customers to manage their debt and avoid the need for such action."" EDF said it was important to resume under strict supervision from the regulator. ""We have a duty to keep bills as low as possible, especially given customers are struggling, and rising debt levels are leading to all households facing bigger bills,"" a spokesman for the company said. Ofgem is proposing lifting the energy price cap by £16 for a household with typical gas and electricity usage between April and March 2025, to cover unpaid debt levels among energy customers which has risen to £2.9bn.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67518869,Where will all the electric cars be charged?,"If electric cars are ever to become mainstream, then we are going to need a lot more places to charge them.",2024-01-09,"If electric cars are ever to become mainstream, then we are going to need a lot more places to charge them. The key is to find space for chargers where people would actually use them. Kerbside is the obvious spot, but there chargers are competing for space with pedestrians, wheelchair users, and others. One solution is to simply repurpose existing infrastructure, without adding extra clutter to the built environment. For instance, lamppost electric vehicle (EV) charging is expanding. A big advantage of repurposing existing lampposts is that cities don't have to dig in order to lay new cables, says Artis Markots, the chief executive of the Latvian start-up SimpleCharge, which is focusing on Central and Eastern Europe. There are no complex permitting requirements, and a lamppost can be complemented with an EV charger within an hour. The cost is also considerably lower than a fixed charger, Mr Markots reports, at roughly €1,500 ($1,600: £1,300) per charger. The Dutch company CityCharge also offers lamppost charging, but with a different model that requires new cables to be installed. CityCharge replaces conventional lighting poles with aluminium poles. These have sleek black boxes for the payment terminal and charger. Excluding installation, costs are in the €3-4,000 range per pole. Heimen Visser, CityCharge's chief executive, acknowledges that this is a bit more expensive than other on-street chargers. But he believes that this is essentially a 2-for-1 product, in which the pole's lighting and charging can be serviced together. Lamppost charging makes it possible to blanket towns and cities with lots of non-rapid chargers. The models of both CityCharge and SimpleCharge can go up to 22kW - faster than slow overnight chargers, but not as zippy as rapid chargers. They can also operate 24/7. However, Mr Markots says that in places with older infrastructure, they're more likely to be for night-time charging, while the streetlights are switched on. The Shell-owned company ubitricity has been adding EV charging capacity not only to lampposts, but also to bollards that it designs. Its bollards and lampposts offer charging at a typical rate of 5kW. Some EV charging companies have been labouring over the design so that chargers are either unobtrusive or even visually appealing. This includes chargers that are embedded into the ground - for example, pop-up chargers that can sink back into the pavement when they're not being used. Trojan Energy is a Scottish company whose chargers sit flush with the pavement, resembling miniature manhole covers from the outside. Most passers-by probably wouldn't even notice them. The company has consulted with disability organisations to ensure that the chargers aren't hazardous to those with mobility or sight impairments, for instance. Trojan Energy has been working with North London councils to site hubs of six to 15 charge points, mainly along residential streets without driveways, where drivers are dependent on street parking. ""Rows and rows of terraced houses are perfectly suited to our solution,"" says Sarah Clements, Trojan Energy's head of business development. Customers need a dedicated attachment, called a lance, and which weighs 2.7 kg, to use a Trojan Energy charging point. Billing is done automatically through the lance. So the potential inconvenience of carrying around an extra device might be offset by the convenience of plug-and-play charging. Opening up the street, doing the civil and electrical work, and then restoring the pavement requires some time, of course. Installation takes about two weeks for each hub. More technology of business Meanwhile, BT Group plans to convert old green street cabinets into charging points. The metal cabinets are traditionally used to store broadband and phone cabling, but many are coming towards the end of their lifespans. A pilot programme is due to get underway soon in Scotland and BT thinks eventually up to 60,000 cabinets could be converted. A different space-saving solution focuses on flexibility, rather than fixed points on existing pavements. Mobile chargers are being trialled in places like airport car parks, where it would make little sense to leave a car plugged into a charger for multiple weeks while the driver is travelling. The UK company Nyobolt recently created Bolt-ee, a compact, ultra-rapid charger that can provide up to 300kW of DC power to charge a car within minutes. Sai Shivareddy, Nyobolt's CEO and co-founder, likens this mobile device to a suitcase in size, though it's heavier. One version of Bolt-ee is mounted on wheels and semi-autonomous, so that it can rove around to reach a vehicle that needs a quick hit of power. Full autonomy would be challenging to achieve. At the moment Bolt-ee still needs a human operator to plug the cable into the car. ""To get an arm that goes into the charge point location is a big challenge,"" Mr Shivareddy says. Carmaker Hyundai has developed an automatic charging robot whose robotic arm guides the charging cable into the port, using an AI algorithm that works with a 3D camera. However, for now the base of the robot is fixed in place, while the arm moves around. Overall, the flexibility of a mobile charger would allow space to be saved, and drivers wouldn't have to fight for parking spots near a fixed charger. Mr Shivareddy says the mobile technology is also useful for rescue operations, so that a car wouldn't need to be towed just because it's run out of power. And depending on how they're rolled out, mobile chargers could address some of the inequities in where existing chargers are placed - largely along highways and in wealthy parts of cities. Nyobolt says that Bolt-ee's battery life exceeds 10,000 cycles. According to Mr Shivareddy, Bolt-ee works out cheaper than other chargers per kW. Fully mobile charging could be useful for people with disabilities, says Liana Cipcigan, a professor of transport electrification and smart grids at Cardiff University's School of Engineering. Prof Cipcigan says that mobile charging robots aren't necessarily commercially viable yet. Another concern with mobile chargers is safety. ""Moving these batteries could be a hazard,"" Prof Cipcigan notes. In terms of fire risks, Mr Shivareddy says that Nyobolt has carefully designed Bolt-ee to be ultra-efficient, and thus to generate very little waste heat. None of these solutions alone will be sufficient to meet growing demand. There aren't enough lampposts and bollards. Mobile robotic charging may remain niche. And pavement-embedded chargers won't be suitable in places where the pavements are often sparse or dilapidated, like Los Angeles. But together these kinds of innovative, space-saving solutions will help push forward the EV transformation. As Prof Cipcigan says, there is much space for innovation in the EV charging market, and younger and smaller companies ""could make an interesting impact on this very complex landscape"".","['Artificial intelligence', 'Electric cars', 'Technology of Business', 'Robotics']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11FDA/production/_131809637_gettyimages-1433395817.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D1BA/production/_131809635_ubitricitylamppostcharging.creditchristinero..jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B06/production/_131809553_atrojanenergychargerembeddedintothepavement.creditchristinero..jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/357A/production/_131809631_thebolt-eemobilecharger.creditnyobolt..jpg']",['Christine Ro'],Business,Technology of Business

Complainants will receive a cut of a $500m (£394m) settlement which works out to around $92 (£72) per claim. Apple agreed to settle the lawsuit in 2020, stating at the time it denied any wrongdoing but was concerned with the cost of continuing litigation. A similar case under way in the UK is seeking £1.6bn in compensation. The US case dates back to December 2017, when Apple confirmed a long-held suspicion among phone owners by admitting it had deliberately slowed down some iPhones as they got older. It said that as batteries aged, their performance decreased, and so the ""slowdown"" lengthened the phones' lifespan. But it was accused of throttling the performance of certain iPhones without telling its customers, and the uproar resulted in Apple offering a cut-price battery replacement to fix the problem. It led to the US legal action. At the time of the settlement, it was estimated that each person might receive as little as $25 each but the actual pay-out appears to be almost four times that sum. In the UK, Apple lost a bid to block a similar mass action lawsuit last November. The case, first brought by Justin Gutmann in June 2022, represents an estimated 24 million iPhone users. Apple has previously called the lawsuit ""baseless"" and said ""we have never - and would never - do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades"". Mr Gutmann told the BBC he was pleased to hear about payments being made in the US, but warned it does not have any bearing on the UK case. ""It doesn't advance our position here, they haven't admitted anything - they've settled,"" he said. ""It's a moral victory but not much use to me. I've got to plough on and pursue the case in the UK jurisdiction."" He said Apple was ""fighting tooth and nail"" against the UK class action, which will next appear at the Court of Appeal who will consider a call from the firm to halt the case.

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67912033,New material found by AI could reduce lithium use in batteries,"A brand new substance, which could reduce lithium use in batteries, has been discovered using artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing.",2024-01-09,"A brand new substance, which could reduce lithium use in batteries, has been discovered using artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing. The findings were made by Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), which is part of the US Department of Energy. Scientists say the material could potentially reduce lithium use by up to 70%. Since its discovery the new material has been used to power a lightbulb. Microsoft researchers used AI and supercomputers to narrow down 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than a week - a screening process that could have taken more than two decades to carry out using traditional lab research methods. The process from inception to the development of a working battery prototype took less than nine months. The two organisations achieved this by using advanced AI and high-performance computing which combines large numbers of computers to solve complex scientific and mathematical tasks. Executive vice president of Microsoft, Jason Zander, told the BBC one of the tech giant's missions was to ""compress 250 years of scientific discovery into the next 25"". ""And we think technology like this will help us do that. This is the way that this type of science I think is going to get done in the future,"" he said. Lithium is often referred to as ""white gold"" because of its market value and silvery colour. It is one of the key components in rechargeable batteries (lithium-ion batteries) that power everything from electric vehicles (EVs) to smartphones. As the need for the metal ramps up and the demand for EVs rises, the world could face a shortage of the material as soon as 2025, according to the International Energy Agency. It is also expected that demand for lithium-ion batteries will increase up to tenfold by 2030, according to the US Department for Energy, so manufacturers are constantly building battery plants to keep up. Lithium mining can be controversial as it can take several years to develop and has a considerable impact on the environment. Extracting the metal requires large amounts of water and energy, and the process can leave huge scars in the landscape, as well as toxic waste. Dr Nuria Tapia-Ruiz, who leads a team of battery researchers at the chemistry department at Imperial College London, said any material with reduced amounts of lithium and good energy storage capabilities are ""the holy grail"" in the lithium-ion battery industry. ""AI and supercomputing will become crucial tools for battery researchers in the upcoming years to help predict new high-performing materials,"" she said. But Dr Edward Brightman, lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Strathclyde, said the tech would need to be ""treated with a bit of caution"". ""It could throw up spurious results, or results that look good at first, and then turn out to either be a material that is known or that can't be synthesised in the lab,"" he said. This AI-derived material, which at the moment is simply called N2116, is a solid-state electrolyte that has been tested by scientists who took it from a raw material to a working prototype. It has the potential to be a sustainable energy storage solution because solid-state batteries are safer than traditional liquid or gel-like lithium. In the near future, faster charging solid-state lithium batteries promise to be even more energy-dense, with thousands of charge cycles. The way in which this technology works is by using a new type of AI that Microsoft has created, trained on molecular data that can actually figure out chemistry. ""This AI is all based on scientific materials, database and properties,"" explained Mr Zander. ""The data is very trustworthy for using it for scientific discovery."" After the software narrowed down the 18 candidates, battery experts at PNNL then looked at them and picked the final substance to work on in the lab. Karl Mueller from PNNL said the AI insights from Microsoft pointed them ""to potentially fruitful territory so much faster"" than under normal working conditions. ""[We could] modify, test and tune the chemical composition of this new material and quickly evaluate its technical viability for a working battery, showing the promise of advanced AI to accelerate the innovation cycle,"" he said.","['Artificial intelligence', 'Batteries', 'Microsoft', 'Mining']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/125B8/production/_132229157_aiandhpccomputingspeedingupscientificdiscovery4.jpg'],['Shiona McCallum'],Tech,Tech
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67922296,"Apple Vision Pro: $3,499 headset finally gets release date",Apple has announced its long-awaited Vision Pro headset will go on sale on 2 February in the United States.,2024-01-09,"Apple has announced its long-awaited Vision Pro headset will go on sale on 2 February in the United States. US customers have been given the option to pre-order the $3,499 (£2,749) mixed-reality device from mid-January, though no date has been set for a UK launch. It is the first major new product to be released by the firm since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. After years of rumours during development, the company revealed the headset in June 2023. But there have been issues since then. According to the Financial Times, Apple has more than halved its production forecasts, dropping from an estimated one million units to 400,000 in 2024. As well as the release date, Apple also announced the device will have 256GB of storage, and it clarified that the headset's eye-tracking technology can function by monitoring just one dominant eye, for people who do not have full use of both their eyes. But interestingly the firm is trying to separate the headset from other devices on the market, telling developers for the device to instead brand their apps as ""spatial computing"". ""Don't describe your app experience as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR),"" it said in a blog post targeting developers. Apple has also released a trailer online, featuring characters from films donning goggles and helmets, in what feels like an attempt to recreate the hype around the launch of the iPhone in 2007. If successful, this could be a new multi-billion dollar source of income for Apple. But as many people all over the world struggle to afford life's basics, the high price tag is likely to keep this in the realm of a toy for the well-off. The BBC had the opportunity to try out the Vision Pro in June last year, and found mixed reality to be a mixed bag. We were among the few news organisations in the world allowed to test out the device - but no photos or filming were allowed. Unlike many existing headsets, Apple has detached the battery, so it doesn't sit heavy on your head - although it does mean the battery has to sit beside you instead, attached to a cable. The user experience is classic, minimalist Apple. Once the headset is on, you see the room around you but you're not seeing it through glass, you're seeing it through the many on-board cameras. This is the ""mixed-reality"" experience - digital content projected on to your surroundings. You physically press a single button on the top right-hand side of the headset, and up pops familiar app icons you'll recognise if you have used an iPhone - iMessage, Photos, Apple TV (there will be more as developers make them). And from then on it's all about gesture control - the headset tracks where you are looking so when you look at an app and pinch your thumb and forefinger together, it opens. You can choose your level of immersion using a physical dial to turn up or down the size of whatever it is that you're looking at. It can fill the entire room or appear like a TV screen superimposed against your wall. But if someone walks in front of you in real life, you can see them no matter how immersed you are. Still, whenever there was an issue with the demo, an Apple employee would remind us that it was not a finished product, and Apple's ban on any filming during the demonstration meant that these issues couldn't be recorded or shared online.

Four videos by Millie Bracewell, of Blackpool, about her surgery at the Erdem Clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, in August 2023, were investigated. The influencer who has 1.7m followers included a 20% discount code in one. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the ads must not appear again. Ms Bracewell became a TikTok sensation when she was 16 after a track she wrote 'M to the B' was picked up by a US influencer Bella Poarch. The music clip has been watched almost half a billion times on the social media platform. Ms Bracewell previously spoke to the BBC about how it became a viral hit, and how she hoped it would open doors in the music industry. The ASA upheld the posts were not identifiable as marketing communications, they were irresponsible because they trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery highlighting one video featuring soundbites from the Barbie film, and said the videos had taken ""insufficient care"" to ensure the ad was not directed at people under 18. One post about her breast augmentation contained ""click the link in my bio to get 20% off any surgery/treatment using the code millieb"". The authority said the ads must not appear again in their current form and told Erdem Clinic and Ms Bracewell to ensure future ads were ""obviously identifiable"" as marketing communications by including identifiers such as ""#ad"" that were ""prominently displayed"". The ASA also told both the TikToker and the clinic to ensure ads were ""socially responsible, did not trivialise the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery, and were appropriately targeted"". Ms Bracewell told the ASA the posts were not ads and she was ""simply vlogging her journey"". She added she had not received payment from the clinic. She also said she would never promote that type of content to under 18s and her audience was primarily adults. She provided her audience age analytics but there was no available data on followers below the age of 18, the ASA said. The clinic, which did not respond to the ASA's inquiries breaching a UK code, has been referred to its compliance team. The advertising watchdog said TikTok confirmed the posts under investigation were not marketed, sold or arranged by the company behind the social video app. It said under its terms of service and branded content policy, users were required to use a disclosure tool to identify marketing communication, the ASA said. TikTok stated the promotion of cosmetic surgery was prohibited so if Ms Bracewell had used the tool, the posts would have been rejected. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

Previously known as Fifa, the Electronic Arts (EA) football series ditched the sport's governing body's name after almost 30 years. It prompted questions about whether sales would suffer. But the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association (ERA) said the latest title sold 2.25m copies in the UK last year. It said that was only slightly below Fifa 23, which sold 2.39m copies in 2022, and was released close to the winter men's World Cup. EA FC 24 received a ""generally favourable"" response on review aggregator Metacritic, with an average score of 73 out of 100. It has a user score of just 2.3 out of 10 on the site, but it's been suggested that's down to a review-bombing campaign, with hundred of players leaving negative remarks. Experts previously told the BBC that Fifa's success owed a lot to the deals allowing it to use player's faces and accurate replica kits. And EA made a big point of stressing that it had kept hold of those for its rebranded title, making itself the only game in town if you wanted to play as your footballing idol. Elsewhere, ERA said Hogwarts Legacy was the second-best selling game in the UK, followed by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. GamesIndustry.biz said PS5 exclusive Spider-Man 2 was at number six, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was at seven. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was in ninth place, despite Nintendo keeping digital sales data secret, and Diablo 4 was 10th. According to ERA, gaming sales increased by 2.9% in 2023, with digital purchases accounting for about 90% of revenue. It said physical games sales fell again by 4.4%, taking in £495.0m of the £4.7bn total. CEO Kim Bayley said gaming ""continued to show its ability to connect with people"" last year, and despite the modest growth the industry ""remains a leviathan"".

Andrew McGuinness, from Harpenden, Hertfordshire, founded Layered Reality who created the Elvis Evolution show. He said: ""You're going to be stepping in to intricate sets that make you feel like you've time travelled."" The CEO explained visitors interacted with actors and walked in the king's ""shoes"" to experience his life story. At the end of the experience, visitors watch a performance of an AI powered holographic Elvis in an intimate space. ""It's more about how we want people to feel, we use temperature, taste and smell to make people feel like they are in Memphis in 1958,"" he explained. The Elvis Estate provided Layered Reality with thousands of hours of live footage, home video and still images of the King. ""Abba Voyage had the luxury of capturing live performers, but we're not that fortunate,"" Mr McGuinness said. He added: ""The AI generates an authentic version of Elvis, born of original material, but it [also] allows you to do new things with him."" Mr McGuinness founded Layered Reality in 2017 with the objective of combining emerging technology with theatrical story telling to create a new form of entertainment. ""People didn't want to just watch a story play out in front of them, they wanted to be part of it,"" he said. ""Theatre and very talented actors make that personal, the tech allows us to achieve things that otherwise would be impossible."" The company now runs two venues in London - one based on Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds and another retelling the story of The Gunpowder Plot. ""People feel like they're actually in 1605 or face to face with a Martian fighting machine,"" Mr McGuinness said. The Layered Reality founder said everything they learnt about story telling from previous work will be implemented into Elvis Evolution. Although many have compared the project to the Abba virtual concert show, Mr McGuinness said the experience is more about narrative, like a film. Small groups move through the experience making it ""far more intimate than Abba Voyage but equally uplifting and fun"". The show is still being worked on and the life-sized digital Elvis will make his stage debut in November at a central London location which has yet to be confirmed. ""He's lines of code for now, he's not walking around Harpenden, buying a coffee from Gail's,"" joked Mr McGuinness. Presley, who rose to fame in the 1950s, died in 1977 aged 42. He was know for hits including Hound Dog and Suspicious Minds and would have celebrated his 89th birthday on 8 January. A film about Presley's life, directed by Baz Luhrmann, was released in 2022 and another movie, Priscilla, released in the UK this week, examines the relationship between the singer and his ex-wife. Virtual concerts and events have risen in popularity since Abba launched Abba Voyage in London in May 2022. The concert recreated a 1970s-era digital version of the singers who performed in their very own purpose-built 3,000-capacity arena in east London. It was created by 1,000 visual effects artists and took one billion computing hours to animate the avatars. It makes an estimated £2m per week and, since 2022, has contributed £322.6m in turnover to the London economy. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

The test car travelled around Culham Science Park, and the driver at the wheel was just there as a precaution. It used radar, lidar and other technology, it learnt as it drove and it reacted to other vehicles. Oxa, a technology firm based at the park, builds the software that enables any vehicle to be self-driving. Professor Paul Newman, from the developer, said: ""We're deploying it live now around the world, carrying passengers."" He believes the technology will not appear on private cars, but will be used for shared vehicles such as buses or airport minibuses. He said: ""I think that's how this technology arrives, it arrives in services where the economics is right."" Oxa's aim is not to produce vehicles or even the kit that keeps people safe. It designs the software, the artificial intelligence (AI), which it claims could be fitted to any vehicle. Mr Newman said: ""There's a revolution coming about how we move things and it's going to be software driven, not vehicle driven. ""The revolution now is that you no longer will need to have one operator per vehicle in the vehicle, you will have one operator for many vehicles, not in the vehicle, doing different things."" The developer has also tested the technology on an off-road test vehicle which can function entirely on its own. Currently, fully automated driving systems are not legal in the UK and the Ford Mustang Mach-E is the only one that can legally self-steer on British roads. It can only do this on motorways, with the driver being monitored. The system alerts the driver after four seconds of inattention, to ensure they remain focused on the road. In November last year, the Government introduced a bill to regulate the use of automated vehicles on UK roads and in other public places. Due to the Automated Vehicles Bill, before these vehicles are allowed on UK roads, they will now have to meet or exceed rigorous new safety requirements, as set out in law. Every authorised self-driving vehicle will have a corresponding Authorised Self-Driving Entity - often the manufacturer - which will be responsible for the behaviour of the vehicle when self-driving. Companies will have ongoing obligations to keep their vehicles safe and ensure that they continue to drive in accordance with British laws. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The club hopes to raise £50,000 after its pitch, clubhouse and training facilities next to the River Trent were affected following Storm Henk. The club said its insurance would not cover the costs due to Lady Bay Stadium being built on a floodplain. A major incident was declared along the River Trent last week due to the widespread flooding. The 147-year-old club, in West Bridgford, said it set up an online fundraising page to help it through a ""very difficult time"". ""We urgently need financial help to enable us to reinstate our facilities to provide Championship Rugby matches, community training facilities and private events,"" the club said. ""We're calling on the local rugby community to support us through these unprecedented times for the club."" So far, it has raised more than £17,500 towards its target. Club director Chris Simon said he believed the cost of the damage could be between £50,000 and £100,000, adding it was a ""massive setback"" for the club. ""There's an enormous amount of work to do, but we'll bounce back,"" he said. ""We've had fantastic support."" The club has been forced to postpone its home fixture against London Scottish on Friday as a result of the flooding. Head coach Craig Hammond said the players had been looking forward to their first game of the year, but the pitch was ""under water pretty bad... it's devastating"". He thanked the local community and players, who had been helping to ""salvage"" as much as they could at the stadium, as well as the rugby community. ""Lots of people have been rallying around. Helping clear stuff at the ground and financially. We massively appreciate it,"" he said. Mr Hammond said players had been able to train at the city's two universities, which he was also grateful for. He is hoping the ground will be repaired and ready for the Archers' friendly against the British Army on 26 January. Nottinghamshire County Council said water levels on the River Trent came close to the highest on record from 2000.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63888234,The best way to de-ice a car and other winter tips,Much of the UK is being hit with another major cold spell.,2024-01-09,"Much of the UK is being hit with another major cold spell. Here are some tips for coping with sub-zero temperatures. Marita Moloney, BBC News Live reporter writes: Many drivers have been waking up to frozen landscapes - and the need to de-ice their cars. But they are warned not to use boiling water to de-ice windscreens - hot water can crack the glass and the water will only freeze again on the screen or on the ground. Instead, the AA recommends turning on the car engine - ensuring the wipers are off to avoid damage - and directing warm air to the windscreen. You should also turn on your rear windscreen heater, and use air-con if you have it to ensure your windows don't fog up. The next step is to clear any snow with a soft brush, before using a scraper and liquid de-icer. The AA also advises motorists to steer clear of gimmicky hacks such as rubbing half a potato on the inside windows and windscreen to stop them steaming up, which risks smearing the glass. Michelle Roberts, BBC News health editor writes: Flu and certain other diseases that cause colds and sore throats are more common at this time of year. Cases of norovirus - the winter vomiting bug - have risen, and Covid is still around too. When it is cold outside we tend to spend more time indoors, where it can be easier to catch an infection. For example, coughs and sneezes in an enclosed space with little or no ventilation (windows closed, doors shut) can quickly spread illnesses from person to person. Practising good hygiene - using and then binning a tissue for coughs and sneezes and washing your hands - can help prevent this. Beth Timmins, BBC News business reporter writes: Many people are using portable heaters as an alternative to switching on the central heating, but they can pose a serious fire hazard if not used carefully. Firefighters and safety managers from the charity Electrical Safety First say you should place your heater on a flat surface to ensure it will not fall over. It should be at least 3ft (1m) away from anything flammable. You should not let curtains, clothes, blankets, duvets or armchairs lean against it. You should not use your heater to dry your washing, or leave it unattended for long periods of time, or overnight. The experts also warn against plugging heaters into extension leads, as this could cause a fire. It is also a fire hazard to leave electric blankets on for too long. Using gas heaters also carries the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, so you should have a carbon monoxide alarm in the same room. Babies and children under five are more at risk in cold weather. The NHS advises that children should wear several layers of clothes to keep warm. At night, it recommends using a number of lightweight blankets. Importantly, babies do not need hot rooms at night - a room temperature of between 16-20C (61-68F) is ideal. Overheating is one of the potential causes of sudden infant death syndrome. Remember heads and hands during the winter, the NCT charity says. Keep your baby's head warm when going outside, and use mittens or gloves to stop heat loss. In the car, for safety reasons you should keep thick jumpers and coats to a minimum, so there is not too much padding between your child and the car seat straps. If necessary, you can lay a blanket on top of them once they are safely strapped in. Like humans, animals can be at risk of hypothermia if they become too cold. Veterinary charity PDSA advises giving dogs and cats extra blankets for their beds over the winter months. Raised beds can keep older dogs away from draughts, while cats may like high-up dens. The charity also recommends extra playtime for pets to make sure they keep active if they are spending less time outside. Indoor toys can help. Consider keeping cats inside overnight and provide an indoor litter tray. A sudden drop in temperature can also have a big impact on outside pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs. They should be given extra bedding for warmth and, if possible, moved to a more sheltered space or even brought inside. But you should make sure they have enough indoor space to exercise safely. Dogs still need walks during cold weather. Usually, their fur will keep them warm. But the RSPCA advises buying a winter coat or jumper for sick or elderly dogs, or those with thinner fur. You should check your pet's paws if they have been in snow and ice, as cold temperatures, grit and salt can damage the pads, the PDSA says. If you have to walk in the dark, make sure you and your dog can be seen with hi-vis leads, coats, and LED collars. Drying clothes on radiators is a common practice in the winter. But it can mean turning on heating in parts of the home you are not using. You may also risk making your home damp, which can cause mould. One option is to use a dehumidifier, which takes water out of the air. Some have laundry settings and can be run for several hours next to wet clothes on a drying rack. Financial journalist Martin Lewis previously pointed out on his podcast that running a dehumidifier is generally ""far, far cheaper"" than putting on the heating in a room. You still have to buy a dehumidifier in the first place, but it could prove a good investment. Beth Timmins, BBC News business reporter writes: During previous cold spells, the social media website TikTok has been full of tips for cheap makeshift heaters constructed from tealights and terracotta pots. However, firefighters say they are dangerous and strongly warn against using them. In one case, a fire broke out in a flat in Derby when one of the devices failed, and about 50 people had to be evacuated from their homes. The local fire service said heat released from the base of the tea lights weakened the terracotta plates on which they were standing. This caused the homemade heater to collapse, and the melted wax to ignite.

To qualify, you must already be receiving certain benefits and meet additional criteria outlined on the government website. Qualifying benefits include: Each cold weather payment is paid for a seven-day period and is worth £25. More than one payment will be made during the course of the winter if there are enough periods of cold weather. The scheme runs between 1 November and 31 March each year. Hospital stays can affect payments. You should also tell Jobcentre Plus if you have a baby or if a child under five comes to live with you. The average temperature in your local area must be zero degrees Celsius - or less - for seven days in a row, or be forecast to be below freezing for seven consecutive days. The temperature needs to be recorded by the weather station nearest to your postcode. People in England and Wales can check whether they are eligible by entering the first part of their postcode here. People in Northern Ireland can check their eligibility here. The winter fuel payment is a different benefit, paid to pensioners. More than 11.3 million pensioners received the payment in winter 2022-23. It is worth between £100 and £300, regardless of weather conditions. The amount depends on your age and whether you live alone or with a partner. In winter 2023-24, those eligible are also entitled to a pensioner cost-of-living payment of between £150 and £300. These payments should be made automatically. Some pensioners and other people on low incomes also qualify for the warm-home discount scheme - a one-off £150 discount on their electricity bill, applied between early October 2023 and 31 March 2024. You do not have to do anything in order to get cold weather payments. The money should be paid automatically into the same bank or building society account as your benefits, within two weeks of the qualifying period of cold weather. If you do not receive a payment, contact the Pension Service or Jobcentre Plus. Cold weather payments do not affect other benefits. How are you trying to keep warm in the cold weather?

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-16946762,How to drive in snow and icy weather,"Driving in severe winter weather can pose many challenges, and in very bad conditions it may be best to avoid driving at all unless your journey is essential.",2024-01-09,"Driving in severe winter weather can pose many challenges, and in very bad conditions it may be best to avoid driving at all unless your journey is essential. But if you do need to use your car, make sure you are as well-prepared as possible. Allow extra time before you set off to de-ice the car, and expect journeys to take much longer. Check traffic reports and plan your journey around major roads, which are more likely to be gritted or cleared. Avoid shortcuts on minor roads. Wear warm clothes and comfortable shoes. Pack a coat, hat, gloves, sturdy boots and a blanket to keep you warm in case you do get stuck or have to leave your car. You may also need sunglasses in bright weather. Take some food such as chocolate and biscuits, as well as water and a hot drink if you can. Make sure you have any medication you need. Always carry a fully-charged mobile, a shovel to clear snow and some old bits of carpet, or cat litter, to put under the tyres if you get stuck. Consider buying winter tyres, which offer extra grip, especially if you live in an area which regularly experiences snow. If you have standard tyres, make sure they're inflated at the right pressure, and that each has at least 3mm of tread. Car batteries run down more quickly in winter. Take regular long journeys to keep yours running well or consider using a trickle-charger. Keep screen wash topped up, and use a proper anti-freeze at the right concentration to prevent ice. If there is a risk of windscreen wipers freezing overnight, place cardboard between the blades and the windscreen. Keep your fuel tank topped up so if you are caught out, you have enough fuel to make it home, or run the engine to keep warm. But if you do get stuck, make sure snow doesn't block the exhaust, because noxious fumes can leak into the vehicle. Clear all snow and ice from the windscreen, windows and roof of the car before setting off. Don't use boiling water to de-ice windscreens - hot water can crack the glass, and the water will only freeze again on the screen, or on the ground where you are standing. Check your lights are clear of snow and are working. If you drive a manual vehicle, use second gear to pull away, lifting the clutch gently to avoid wheel spin. Stay in a higher gear for better control as you pick up speed. Many automatic cars have a ""snow"" or ""winter"" gearbox mode. Check your handbook for details. Maintain the right speed: too fast and you risk losing control, but driving too slowly means you might lose momentum when you need it. Brake, steer and accelerate as smoothly as possible, and drive so that you do not rely on your brakes to be able to stop. Remember stopping distances are up to 10 times greater in snow and ice. Leave more space behind the car in front than you usually would. On motorways, stay in the lane clearest of snow, ice and slush, and keep within existing tyre tracks if you can. If you get stuck, don't try to keep moving if the wheels spin - it will only dig you in deeper. Use a shovel to clear snow from under your tyres. Pour cat litter, sand or gravel in front of the wheels to help them get traction. Shift from forward to reverse and back again. Give a light touch on the accelerator until the vehicle gets going. If you can't move your car, you can stay warm by running the engine. However, it is vital to ensure exhaust pipe is not blocked by snow because highly toxic carbon monoxide gas could enter the car. If there is any risk of fumes coming into the vehicle, do not run the engine. Even if it is safe, don't run it for more than 10 or 15 minutes in each hour. Stay in or close to your car. In heavy snow, it is easy to get disorientated and lost or separated from your vehicle. You can hang a piece of brightly coloured cloth on your car to let you or others find it.","['Snow', 'Motoring', 'Severe weather', 'UK snow', 'Road safety']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FEA6/production/_132109156_editgettyimages-172712824.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/73CA/production/_128324692_winter_driving_kit2_2x640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EAE4/production/_128323106_cars_ashford_getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C3D4/production/_128323105_scraping_snow_getty_976.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A0AC/production/_128323114_ice_stopping_distance2x640-nc.png']",['The Visual'],Science,Science

The final decision on the future of Weekley Hall Wood near Kettering, Northamptonshire, has been made by a planning inspector. The inspector said the five warehouses would be too big and would not provide enough high-quality jobs. The developer, Buccleuch Properties, said it was ""disappointed"" the project could not go ahead. Buccleuch Properties applied to build the warehouses and a factory at the wood, to the north of Kettering, in 2020. The ""Save Weekley Hall Wood"" (SWHW) campaign group said the wood and adjacent wildflower meadow provided a habitat for wildlife including frogs, deer and lizards. When a planning decision had not been taken after three years, Buccleuch Properties ""reluctantly"" appealed to the Planning Inspectorate to bypass the local council and get an outcome. The planning inspector, George Baird, heard eight days of evidence in December and has now published his decision. He has rejected the appeal and refused planning permission, saying the warehouses would have been too big and would have affected the landscape. He also cited concerns about the impact of extra traffic on local roads and the failure of the project to deliver ""a high density of high-quality jobs"". In a statement SWHW said: ""We're all celebrating and can hardly believe it. ""We want to thank the thousands of people who signed the petition about this development and who gave so generously their time, energy and money to support us."" A spokesperson for Buccleuch Properties said: ""While we are disappointed that the project cannot proceed, bringing with it the associated employment and economic growth opportunities for the area, we will reflect on the comments made as we look to the future of the area.""

It has also been suggested the graffiti may have been left by children, external because the carvings are low down on the wall.Mary Braithwaite, of Luing History Group, believes the carvings are unique and should be studied in detail before the weather damages them further.She said: ""There is one stone with a whole fleet of longboats. It's quite dramatic.""They have been associated with the Scots king, Alexander II, in 1249.""My own theory is that at least some of them are Norse and more associated with Norwegian expeditions."" Ms Braithwaite added: ""We would really like much more thorough research to be done on them.""They are not preserved at all. ""They are completely in the open air. They have survived some damage through wind and rain.""They are deserving of a lot more attention."" Luing, south of Oban, is only seven miles (11km) long and has a population of just over 160. The island used to have more than a thousand residents when slate quarries in the area were in full production in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Eight hundred years ago Luing was strategically important.The island was in the middle of the sea route between the northern and southern half of the old kingdom controlled by The Lords of The Isles, a succession of powerful nobles. In Gaelic, the longboats that were used in the Hebrides at the time were called birlinn.","['Oban', 'History', 'Archaeology']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/781/cpsprodpb/63f3/live/3dee2050-ae65-11ee-ab2a-dbea3d3a4da2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/876/cpsprodpb/19ee/live/9f53c020-ae65-11ee-ab2a-dbea3d3a4da2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/885/cpsprodpb/88f1/live/7281b170-ae46-11ee-8f23-6f28ab6ef45a.png']",['N/A'],Science,Science

Debbie Wilkins, who owns Norton Court Farm near Gloucester, receives a government grant to set aside 300 acres (121 hectares) as a floodplain. She is one of hundreds of farmers around the country who now let the floodplains ""do their job"". ""It takes the pressure off the river and protects the properties below us,"" Ms Wilkins explained. Instead of building barriers to try to keep the water out, she keeps the floodplain land as grass and hay, which won't be destroyed like arable crops. She said the pastures that are allowed to flood have ""brilliant wildlife"" and are ""species rich"". ""Also we're producing food on it. They're working quite hard, these fields."" The government's Environment Land Management scheme offers incentives to farmers to boost sustainable practices. Prof Nicola Cannon from the Royal Agricultural University said: ""I think many farmers are thinking very carefully about making their farms more resilient."" ""We're seeing more freak weather events, including high levels of rainfall causing flooding."" She explained farmers were considering ""how they manage their land"" to minimise risk but also the ""opportunities"" to help communities downstream. Ms Wilkins grew up on the farm she now runs and remembers as a child they had a ""proper flood"" every four or five years. ""And now we're getting two or three a year,"" she added. She said they farm a third of the land in a more ""gentle way"", allowing the floodplains she usually uses for cattle grazing ""to do their job"". Ms Wilkins said, however, that it does cause them some ""hassle"", including have to move the cattle very quickly, as well as there being a ""tide line of rubbish"" in the water. She explained the plants underneath the flood waters had ""been there a long time and they are not your traditional high-yielding ryegrass"". ""These are floodplain meadows, species rich. They have evolved to cope with being flooded and so they'll come back in the summer. ""We'll have lovely fields full of flowers and grass, which we'll cut for hay and afterwards the cattle will come and graze them. That's the cycle."" Prof Cannon explained this method was easier for livestock farmers, who can move their stock, rather than those growing crops. She explained the residual silt from flood water leaves some ""fertility"" behind, which can boost grass growth and biodiversity. The professor of agriculture said flooded farmland was a ""very traditional practice"", adding: ""It's only in more recent times that we've seen this land converted to cropping where it's been so much more vulnerable to erosion."" Ms Wilkins, like many other farmers, has other fields with arable crops that have also flooded, at a cost of thousands of pounds. The national Farmer's Union (NFU) says farmers who are expected to let fields of crops flood to protect towns should be compensated. Zoe Moore, an environmental policy adviser specialising in flood management at the NFU, said many farms were still recovering from Storm Gerrit and Storm Babet when Storm Henk hit last week. ""So this has, sort of, been a double hit for them. Lots will have recently planted crops that are now going to be rotting in the ground or not had the chance to grow.

Schoolchildren and volunteers took part in an excavation at Warham Camp in north Norfolk for three weeks during July. The dig was picked up by the programme, presented by Prof Alice Roberts. Project director Andrew Hutcheson said: ""For the volunteers, having Alice Roberts on site was magical for them."" Warham Camp, one of Norfolk's few hillforts, dates to between 800BC and AD43 and is about 100m (328ft) in diameter. The scheduled monument is also a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) and was last excavated in 1959. A team of archaeologists from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit hoped to establish what activities took place in the hillfort, which is near Wells-next-the-Sea. Dr Hutcheson, of the University of East Anglia's Sainsbury Institute, said they did not uncover evidence of ""significant structures, such as large houses, being built"". He suggested it might have been used for temporary ""political gatherings"" or there ""may also have been a ritual significance"" to the site. He said: ""It's exciting to know all that effort went into creating a fort that was maybe just a temporary meeting place."" This is in contrast to the ""developed"" hillforts found in southern England, such as Danebury in Hampshire, and Maiden Castle in Dorset, where there is evidence of settlement. Dr Hutcheson said ""we don't have the answers"", but it could be that East Anglia lacked the ""smaller scale internecine fighting that meant you needed almost permanent residence"" in the fort. More than 3,500 finds were discovered during the excavation, including animal bone, glass and worked flints and 1,405 broken pieces of pottery. It sheds light on Iron Age Norfolk in the centuries before and during the era of the Iceni tribe, whose queen Boudicca led a failed revolt against the Romans in about AD60. It also revealed how the fort was back in use in the late 4th Century as a base for Roman metal working, but once again, there was no evidence of any large-scale buildings. Dozens of pupils from the Synergy Multi-Academy Trust and 33 volunteers from the Restoration Trust were involved in the community dig, which is part of the Later Prehistoric Norfolk Project. Dr Hutcheson said the volunteers ""got a real feeling they were partaking in something important if Digging for Britain takes notice of their work"".

The local deer population is believed to be three times higher than what it should be. Culling has been used to try to control the population of deer and limit their impact. PETA UK's vice president of programmes Elisa Allen said culling was ""ineffective"" and ""cruel"". But the Countryside Alliance said sustained management of deer populations was vital to ""maintain a healthy and balanced"" environment in the UK, and that culling was a ""humane"" method. Its spokesperson, Roger Seddon, said: ""With the population of deer in England at its highest since the Norman conquest, and in the absence of any natural predators, culling is a necessary, humane and widely accepted method of deer management. ""By controlling deer numbers, we ensure that young trees can grow, habitat for rare species can be conserved and that healthy, lean, iron-rich meath enters the food chain."" Countryside manager Ash Walmsley said the deer population was having a ""significant impact on our woodland economy"". ""We need to find a way of sustainably managing our deer population or else we will not have a healthy woodland habitat for wildlife to thrive,"" he added. The Woodland Trust said over-grazing from deer could prevent the regeneration of woodland, which can have a knock-on impact on other species. Mr Walmsley said impacted animals in Ashdown Forest include dormice and some butterfly species. Ms Allen argued that killing deer only caused their population to rebound as it resulted in a spike in food supply, accelerating the breeding of those alive. Ms Allen said: ""It can be difficult for hunters to get a clear shot and deer often endure slow, horrifyingly painful deaths."" ""We will never achieve ecological harmony through the barrel of a gun,"" she added. Mr Walmsley said he would be ""all for"" an alternative method to culling if it was feasible and successful.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51444789,"Flooding: What are my rights if my home, car or work is affected?","The storms that have swept the UK in recent weeks have brought widespread flooding and left homeowners, motorists and businesses counting the costs.",2024-01-09,"The storms that have swept the UK in recent weeks have brought widespread flooding and left homeowners, motorists and businesses counting the costs. After Storm Henk, which the Environment Agency said left more than 1,800 homes flooded, the government said it would release thousands of pounds to help communities recover. Many affected have been contacting their insurance companies for advice. But cover and compensation can vary significantly depending on the level of impact and the small print in policies, although other automatic protection may be in place. Safety is the key priority, so residents and business owners and their employees should only return to the property when it is safe to do so. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says most home buildings, contents and commercial business policies cover storm damage. Commercial policies cover damage to premises and stock. Business interruption cover, which may be included or purchased separately as part of an insurance agreement, will cover additional trading costs. Comprehensive motor insurance covers the cost of repairing or replacing vehicles damaged by storms. The ABI has a six-step recovery guide on what to do if your home or business is flooded: The ABI's general insurance policy adviser Louise Clark said insurers expect bad weather and events like these ""are exactly what your insurance is for"". ""Their priority right now is to help any affected customers recover as quickly as possible,"" she added. But insurance loss assessors Harris Balcombe told the BBC flood victims should be prepared to wait to have their claims assessed because industry resources were in ""dire straits"". Partner Alex Balcombe said: ""The sense I'm getting is that although the storms have not been as severe, there's been a larger number and this incremental 'drip, drip, drip' has left people waiting a long time. ""Adjusters can't give policy holders the assurance they need."" The ABI said there had been eight storms across the UK in the last three months and that insurers were ""working round the clock"" to support customers. ""Where supply chains are stretched, insurers will look to triage the most vulnerable wherever possible and will keep customers updated so that they know when repairs can be carried out,"" adviser Ms Clark said. In the meantime, policyholders are advised to avoid throwing things away where possible. But Mr Balcombe suggested the situation was being made worse because many consumers are under-insured, having bought the ""cheapest product they can find online"". The government says money will be available to help communities in England who have experienced ""exceptional localised flooding"". Applicants need to be in ""eligible affected areas"".  Help will be available for: Some homes have been without power during these storms, making life particularly uncomfortable during the extreme weather. There are rules in place that mean compensation may be paid by the local electricity distributor. The level of compensation is £70, with further payments of £70 if the situation continues for a long time. However, whether this is payable, and when, depends on the severity of the situation in each area. The Energy Ombudsman, an impartial referee following complaints, points out that residents without power should be kept updated on the situation and on their right to compensation by their local distributor. Employees are urged to contact their workplace if they have problems getting to work and employers should try to provide alternative working arrangements where possible, according to the latest advice from the conciliation service Acas. ""Extreme weather has caused disruption across much of the road and rail networks which will impact workers' ability to travel to work. ""Some employers will also have concerns about staff absences impacting their productivity and performance,"" a statement from the organisation said. Acas's top tips for workers affected by the bad weather include: The service also says if you're available to work but your place of work is closed, then you will usually be entitled to normal pay. A host of rail routes have been affected by the recent storms, owing to fallen trees and debris on the line, as well as flooding. A number of train operating companies in affected areas have issued advice for customers. Generally, refunds are available for cancelled trains, or if you do not want to travel owing to the weather. For delays, irrespective of the reason, many companies offer an automatic compensation service, although a claim still needs to be made. It can be more complicated for those with season tickets. Some companies still operate under rules where they are not obliged to give any kind of refund if the delay is beyond their control, and severe weather does fall into that category. If you are booked on a specific service which is cancelled, then you must check with staff instead of simply getting on the next available train to your destination. There is more clarity for planes than for trains. If a flight is cancelled then you can take a refund, or an alternative route or flight to your destination. You must talk to the airline, rather than booking it yourself. The airline should look after you, such as providing meals if it is a long delay, but they do not have to pay the extra compensation that would be due had the delay been the airline's fault.","['Personal finance', 'Money', 'Insurance', 'Floods', 'Severe weather']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0015/production/_132212000_d23734336adff3ac7d9f1c5f038c3d6358ca287d0_0_3500_20001000x571.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4205/production/_132210961_gloucester-index-bbc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175BF/production/_132197659_gettyimages-1904519145.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D00E/production/_132126235_mediaitem132126234.jpg']","['Kevin Peachey', 'Jemma Dempsey']",Science,Science

New wheelie bins with purple lids have been delivered to around 68,000 households across South Kesteven. The council said the first collection of the new bins will be in the week beginning 5 February, so people should start using them now. The aim of the project is to make recycling paper and cardboard easier. Until now, householders have put these items in their silver recycling bin, which meant it was often mixed with other materials. Around 30% of the recycling materials collected in the area are unable to be recycled, because some residents place it in the wrong bin and it becomes contaminated, according to South Kesteven District Council. A spokesperson said the new bin means clean, dry paper and card can be taken directly to a dedicated paper mill for recycling into paper-based products. Bins with purple lids for paper and cardboard have already been introduced in Boston, North Kesteven, West Lindsey and East Lindsey.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67921673,Post Office scandal: The power of the docudrama to bring about justice,"The million dollar question in journalism, if little known outside the industry, is ""cut through"" - how can a story be made to not only reach an audience, but keep them hooked.",2024-01-09,"The million dollar question in journalism, if little known outside the industry, is ""cut through"" - how can a story be made to not only reach an audience, but keep them hooked. It is a challenge that investigative journalist Nick Wallis, one of the key voices to first expose the post office scandal at the turn of the millennium, will know all too well. His work helped give a voice to over 700 workers prosecuted after faulty post office software, known as Horizon, made it appear that money was missing. The fight for justice in the decades since has seen Wallis publish his own book on the scandal (serialised in the Daily Mail), alongside investigations by BBC Panorama, Computer Weekly and Private Eye amongst others. But 25 years on from the first convictions for theft and fraud, it is the four-part ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office that has renewed mass public interest in the scandal like never before. Watched by nine million viewers so far according to ITV figures, the mini-series centres on the story of sub-postmaster Alan Bates, played by actor Toby Jones, who led and won a legal battle paving the way for dozens of convictions to be overturned. Since the series began airing on 1 January, 50 new potential victims have contacted lawyers, some of whom were former sub-postmasters prosecuted by the Post Office. Westminster has tried to keep pace, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling the case an ""appalling miscarriage of justice"" in an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday. The government is now under pressure to overturn wrongful convictions and deal with compensation, with ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells agreeing to hand back her CBE in response to the public outcry. It marks a long-awaited breakthrough for victims. But why now, and why in response to a TV show? For the show's executive producer Patrick Spence, it proves the unique power drama can hold in forging human connection. He told BBC Radio 4: ""Drama can go inside the homes of the sub-postmasters who so suffered and dramatise the pain that they went through. ""[It] can do something that a documentary and a newspaper article can't… they can bring to life the true emotional impact on the people who were victimised by the Post Office's abhorrent behaviour."" But these two mediums, rather than working in competition, often complement each other to forge a lasting impact, says arts writer Fiona Sturges. ""I think it's easy to look at the media as a separate entity when so often these types of dramas are inspired by stories painstakingly researched over years by journalists. ""But I also think TV dramas can bring a level of humanity and colour that print media can't always manage, largely due to limits on space and reach."" The response is far from the first time a docudrama has caught public attention and put politicians under pressure to act. Cathy Come Home, Ken Loach's BBC television play about homelessness, sparked a huge public reaction when first broadcast in 1966. As Mark Lawson wrote in the Guardian, the charities Crisis and Shelter ""doubtless benefitted"" from the parliamentary debate and raised awareness of disadvantage that followed the drama. Sturges adds that it allowed audiences to ""really dwell on what that would be like and to create a space where statistics become people with complex characters and stories"". In a similar vein, she says Jimmy McGovern's Hillsborough, which dramatised the fight for justice by the families of 97 Liverpool fans killed during the Sheffield Wednesday stadium crush in 1989, took the uneasiness and ugliness gleaned from extensive journalism on the topic and turned it into an ""emotionally-charged human story"". Centred around the two years after the tragedy when the original inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death in 1991, its airing five years later helped solidify a shift in public opinion. When the verdicts were eventually overturned in 2016 and the deaths ruled unlawful, then-Walton MP Steve Rotheram called the docudrama ""massively influential"" in pushing for the truth. McGovern told the BBC he was approached to make the drama by the Hillsborough families not because the story wasn't known, but because it was framed in a certain way - and a docudrama turned the narrative around. It made it a story about institutional failure after fans had wrongfully been blamed for the disaster. It made the families the heroes and rightful victims of the story. This same sense of indignation has been present in the reaction to Mr Bates, says Spence, who sees the response in political terms. ""As a country we feel unheard by our politicians and by our government. And I think what this drama seems to have done is tapped into that rage. ""Our ambition was simply to allow them to feel that their story was heard… but what people have connected with I think is a sense that nobody is listening to the people that deserve it the most."" The frenzied political and state response, then, including potentially passing a specific law to exonerate those affected, can be seen as an act of preservation. ""There is a growing feeling that the public mood, prompted by the drama, leaves those in government with no alternative but to act, be seen to act, and to do so quickly"", wrote BBC political editor Chris Mason on Tuesday. Toby Jones, the actor portraying Mr Bates, believes the response shows the enduring value of drama in progressing public awareness and national debates. ""Drama is constantly downgraded as a subject of importance, but it's historically always been a place that people, even if they don't believe that it can deliver change, nevertheless it suggests change… and so it cannot be ignored. ""In most of the political upheavals in history, not least ancient Greece and revolutionary Russia, that drama has been at the centre of political change, that people have used it to humanise, dramatise and bring forth change.""","['Post offices', 'Television', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15140/production/_132163368_promo.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/11678/production/_105988217_line976.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/11678/production/_105988217_line976.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/784D/production/_116779703_27a54e04-b263-40de-8724-cdfb310d532b.jpg']","['Alex Taylor', 'Yasmin Rufo']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

Jackdaw is the debut of County Durham filmmaker Jamie Childs, who has returned to his roots to write and direct a story close to his North East heart. “I know that this landscape is massively unused and the potential to basically be used these kind of films,"" he said""We’ve had kitchen sink dramas and things, stuff like that, shot here but what we haven’t had is much stuff with a heightened style, like with a Hollywood cinema style. ""From the skills that I have learned over the years, I knew that I could do that here and prove that you could do that here, and that was important for me."" Jackdaw is the story of army veteran Jack Dawson who returns home to look after his brother after his mother dies. He takes on a job which he thinks will be straightforward but instead it turns into an adrenalin-fuelled nightmare after he is double-crossed and his brother is kidnapped.The film stars Oliver Jackson-Cohen from The Invisible Man and The Haunting of Hill House, alongside Jenna Coleman, from Victoria and Doctor Who, and This is England and The Gallows Pole actor Thomas Turgoose. While the film has action at its heart, Childs also wanted his film to have ""a bit of heart and humour"" to it and be rooted in North East humour and traditions.""That is something that you might truly only understand if you are from the region, but it translates as well,"" he said""There is a certain energy up here, there is a Viking energy and Jackdaw very much has that,"" he said.""And that is something I grew up in. All these characters, although fictionalised, are kind of based on people I have come across over the years. ""They have been inspired by scenarios I have been in myself and I wanted to try and fictionalise that, steal all the best bits of North East culture that have made me who I am and try and put all that in to a fun action thriller narrative that could be enjoyed by people who aren’t from here but will hopefully get the vibe."" Childs is best known for his work on TV fantasy drama shows Willow, The Sandman and His Dark Materials, as well as on Doctor Who and Vera.Originally from Shotton Colliery and, despite often being away filming, he frequently comes back to the North East to see his family.It was the view of the Hartlepool Headland from his house, which provided him with the inspiration for the storyline and which he described as an ""amazing backdrop"". ""And I could see this whole coastline,"" he said.""Seal Sands, which is all the oil refineries and stuff, is just so cinematic. You go there at night and it is just lit up like a Christmas tree. ""And a fact I keep telling people is that when Ridley Scott used to live up here when he was younger, that landscape inspired the view of Los Angeles in the first Bladerunner. ""Obviously he never shot there but I was like I could shoot that as a backdrop, as a free production value you know. ""By choosing those locations around that coastline, that I knew had this really cinematic value to them, you get all that for free essentially, so you are shooting sequences in front of that stuff, and the production value is incredible.""He hopes other filmmakers will be inspired to choose the North East as a location. Jackdaw is the first to be part-financed by North East Screen Industries Partnership, which was set up to attract film and television projects to the region. Childs said as well as the funding, they received a huge amount of logistical support, meaning the film went from being written to completed in about nine months, which he did not think would have been possible otherwise.The film, from Vertigo Releasing, received £300,000 from the fund, which is run by North East Screen. It also used The Northern Studios in Hartlepool as its unit base. It was the first production to use the newly-launched facility, said head of studios Nina Yoxall. “They took over the entire building with prop stores, costume department, art department, camera tech, casting departments, so it was really lively and bustling 24/7,"" she said.""It was fantastic.""She added: ""We used a lot of North East crew, a lot of North East talent, on screen and behind the camera. ""It was wonderful that we could house that here and that’s what we want to do more of in the future."" Childs is also optimistic about using the North East as a location for his future workHe said: ""What has worked really well for this film already, a testament to it, is the Americans have seen it, the producers I know, and they have basically said, can you do this again in that region? ""Can you close down a city or a town but go the next scale up? You know, get an American lead, fish out of water kind of story, so I am working on some stuff like that. ""So we could bring like a big nineties A-lister, some names I won’t mention, to the North East and set a story here with them.” Jackdaw will have its UK premiere on 24 January and opens in UK cinemas on 26 January.

A recent survey revealed there was more of the material at Rickmansworth Aquadrome, Hertfordshire than previously thought. Organisers said a new ""no-dig"" policy made the festival unworkable. Three Rivers District Council said the site was still safe to use and events could continue, under restrictions. The festival - one of largest water-based festivals in the UK - has been running at the site for 30 years. Money previously raised from the event funded educational programmes for children and supported the Rickmansworth Waterways Trust charity. Festival organiser David Montague told the BBC: ""From our charity's perspective it is impractical, dare I say impossible, for us to run the event. ""We can't fix large marquee structures, the stage structures, we can't put anything into the ground. ""They've also discouraged us strongly from driving on the surface."" He added adhering to new restrictions set in a council management plan could cost the charity ""thousand of pounds"". Material containing asbestos was placed at the aquadrome in the 1920's when gravel was removed to build the original Wembley Stadium. There were no records detailing how much, or where the material was, but it has always been known that asbestos was present. A survey for Three Rivers District Council has now shown that asbestos was buried across the site and in some areas it was found to be protruding from the ground. The findings prompted the local authority to issue its site-wide ""no-dig"" policy, in a bid to prevent the material from being disturbed. Three Rivers District council said: ""The aquadrome remains a safe environment for general day-to-day use by the public and can still be used for leisure, such as dog walking, picnics, and water-based activities. ""Events can still go ahead at the aquadrome: however, they must abide by the requirements of the asbestos management plan."" Three Rivers District Council has offered the festival financial support to try to help it go ahead this year. The authority said the cost of cleaning up the asbestos was too prohibitive and therefore it would continue to monitor the asbestos on the site.

At 24, the youngest member of the force's major crime unit said, on arriving at the scene on Tithe Farm Road, officers were faced with ""something a lot more devastating"". ""Rather than being a car accident, it was around 20 seconds of carnage where lives were lost and people were seriously injured,"" he said.

Within six months of the murders, the trial was under way, and by 3 July 2023, Papworth and Bennison were convicted. Det Con Hobday said the ""most important evidence"" for such cases was ""accounts from people"" who were at the crime scene or arrived shortly afterwards.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyxv1vrl60wo,Giant sculpture pays tribute to mining heritage,N/A,2024-01-09,"A renowned sculptor will pay tribute to the north-east of England's mining heritage with a new installation.Ray Lonsdale, the artist behind Seaham's famed Tommy sculpture, has completed work on a memorial to Houghton Colliery.Its rich history will be represented in an artwork standing 16ft (5m) high and including a giant miner's helmet.The sculpture - which Mr Lonsdale worked on alongside his son, Sam - will be officially unveiled in the summer. The artwork will form the centrepiece to a new retail hub under development at the former colliery site.Featuring a miner's helmet, token and head torch, it depicts the end of coal mining in the town and features a 1981 timestamp as a marker of the year the pit closed.Mr Lonsdale said: ""The aim is to remember the pit - through fairly rose-tinted glasses - with the hanging up of the old pit equipment, such as the helmet, torch and the token that the miners would carry on them as they went down the shaft."" Mr Lonsdale said reception to the concept had so far been favourable, adding: ""There is still huge affection for the times when the pits were there and the sense of community spirit which has slipped slightly since those days.""There is a fond reminiscence for that time and a lot of people are pleased that this has been recognised.""I sincerely hope the sculpture will do them proud."" Mr Lonsdale's son, Sam, founded steel fabrication business Creative Ape Fabrications, which helped with fabricating most of the sculpture's finer details, including a giant head torch which will illuminate the surrounding area once complete. Sam said the process had been a labour of love, adding: ""It has been great working on a piece of art which will strike a chord and bring a smile to so many people.""Councillor Kevin Johnston, dynamic city cabinet member at Sunderland City Council - which commissioned and funded the work - visited Mr Lonsdale's workshop in South Hetton.He said: ""When we sold the land last year to the developer, one of the things we really wanted to do was have some artwork installed that would proudly represent the heritage of the area and I think Ray and Sam have captured that perfectly through this work.""I'm sure it will really capture the hearts of residents and become a real asset for the community.""

It will be the first time she's appeared on reality TV since her ex Stephen Bear was jailed for for posting intimate footage of her. She'll be joined in the villa by 11 other Love Island stars including Kaz Kamwi and Toby Aromolaran. Maya Jama will also return to host the spin-off being filmed in South Africa. Georgia, 29, has become known for campaigning on women's safety since Stephen Bear was sentenced to 21 months in prison last March. Announcing her return to the villa, she said the past year had been ""amazing"" but ""heavy at times and pretty serious with all of my campaigning work"". Now Georgia, who first appeared on series three of the ITV2 show in 2017, says she wants to go back into the villa to ""have some fun and hopefully meet someone that I can fall in love with"". The villa is also a place where friendships are made, and that's the case for Kaz Kamwi and Liberty Poole, who've become best mates since appearing in 2021's series. Kaz said meeting Liberty was the memory she ""loved and treasured the most"", but both are expecting a different experience this time around. ""I'm a lot more confident in who I am and sure about exactly what I want from a relationship,"" Liberty said. They'll be joined by fellow All Stars Chris Taylor, Georgia Steele, Anton Danyluk, Hannah Elizabeth, Demi Jones, Jake Cornish, Luis Morrison and Mitchel Taylor. Chris Taylor, who briefly dated Maura Higgins, made a brief cameo as a Ken in last year's Barbie movie. He got the role after meeting Margot Robbie, and said his ""silly chat"" must have ""made an impression"" on the star. ""Eighteen months later I got an email from Warner Bros asking: 'Do you want to try out for this role as Ken?',"" he said. Love Island's ratings have seen a steady drop over the past few years, with last summer's first episode losing more than one million viewers compared with 2022. It's faced competition from a crop of new rivals like BBC Three's I Kissed a Boy, the UK's first gay dating show, and scrutiny over its duty of care to contestants. All Stars is the latest attempt to put a new spin on the format after the recent Love Island Games, which saw islanders from around the world compete in challenges. Love Island All Stars airs on ITV2 on 15 January.

Jessica Daley drove from Middlesbrough to Leicester to star as Eva Peron in Evita on Saturday after the original actor and understudy both fell ill. She was left ""genuinely shaking"" following the call - which came shortly after she stepped out of the bath. Original lyricist Sir Tim Rice said he intended to thank Ms Daley and hoped to take in the show. Ms Daley said she was at her family home during a break in another touring production and was sorting out clothes when she got the call shortly before 12:00 GMT. ""My initial reaction was shock,"" she said. ""I was shaking, I was genuinely shaking. ""I was thinking 'can I do this? What is going on?' ""Then you just go into a state of, not panic, but shock and feeling overwhelmed and 'what do I need to do?' And 'action stations'. ""I was staying at my mum's house and I wanted to tell her but she had taken the dog out and left her phone at home. ""So I waited for her to come back and I said 'I'm going. I'm going.' ""So it was a bit chaotic and I leapt into action and the suitcase which is kind of half-full from the tour had everything thrown back into it so I shut it, put it in my car and hit the road."" Ms Daley travelled the 150 miles to Leicester's Curve theatre, arriving at about 16:00. ""I walked straight into the building, straight on to stage, straight into rehearsals, singing through the score which I hadn't sung for four years,"" she said. ""So we just hit the ground running."" With such limited time and dealing with a different production of the musical, Ms Daley sang some of her part from the side of the stage. ""This production was completely different to the production I did,"" she said. ""It is much more modern and has been re-invented. ""I had to be able to jump back in with the same character in a day and a very different set-up. ""It was just crazy but the cast and everybody was so accommodating and friendly and went with me, and it's a credit to the company that they accepted me."" Chris Stafford, Curve's chief executive, said: ""Watching Jess was absolutely sublime. ""She was a superstar. She wasn't just standing at the side singing it, which would be more than enough. She acted it, she was interacting, she was on stage performing the role of Eva. ""I felt really proud of Jess and also the phenomenal Evita company who really wrapped around her and made sure she was really safe and secure in our stage."" Ms Daley received a standing ovation for her performance and is on standby for Tuesday's show in case of any further problems. She has also performed in stage versions of Billy Elliot, An Officer and a Gentleman, and The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lord Lloyd-Webber and Sir Tim Rice wrote the musical about the life of Argentine political leader Eva Peron in 1978. It was turned into a film in 1996 with Madonna in the title role. Sir Tim said he had heard about the efforts to save the show and intended to thank Ms Daley and the production team personally. Follow BBC Tees on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

The shows have been running at the Royal Albert Hall since 2000, raising more than £32m from ticket sales. Daltrey will kick off his final year by staging two orchestral sets with The Who. Noel Gallagher, Young Fathers and The Chemical Brothers will also play. The series will end with a celebration of the series of shows. Titled Ovation, the concert will feature Daltrey himself, accompanied by artists who helped establish the gigs as a fixture of the music calendar. The line-up will include Robert Plant, Paul Weller, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, the Stereophonics' Kelly Jones and Daltrey's long-time musical foil, Pete Townshend. From 2025, the concerts will be overseen by a series of guest curators. Daltrey will continue as a Teenage Cancer Trust Honorary Patron. In a statement, the rock star said: ""The £32m raised from these concerts has been the foundation for the 28 specialised units within the NHS, as well as specialist nurses and youth workers to be there for a young person when cancer has turned their world upside down."" Gallagher added: ""Teenage Cancer Trust continue to make a real difference to teenagers in what undoubtedly must be the most challenging years of their lives. ""Having performed at the very first event back in 2000, it is a charity very close to my heart."" Here are some of the hundreds of stars who have performed at the concerts over the last quarter of a century. ""Quite simply, we would not be the charity we are without Roger and these shows,"" said the trust's chief executive, Kate Collins. ""More importantly than that - thousands of young people with cancer in the UK would not have had the specialist support and care they urgently need.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-67885844,Izzy Judd: 'Music let my brother in a coma connect with us',Rupert Johnston had been in a coma for two months after a horrific car crash in February 1997 and was showing no signs of brain activity.,2024-01-09,"Rupert Johnston had been in a coma for two months after a horrific car crash in February 1997 and was showing no signs of brain activity. Doctors advised turning off the 18-year-old musician's life support machine. But his father brought his son's beloved French horn to his bedside. Rupert, who grew up in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, began slowly moving his fingers along the valves in time to a Mozart recording. ""That was our first moment of hope that there was something there,"" recalls his younger sister, violinist Izzy Judd, who was 12 at the time. Rupert's skull needed to be rebuilt. He had 13 hours of brain surgery, where they removed his front left lobe, with his right lobe left in place but permanently damaged. ""The muscles around his lips, which he used to play the horn, were the only part of his face that wasn't severely damaged,"" Izzy says. Rupert was studying at the Guildhall School of Music at the time of the accident, having left home at the age of eight to become a chorister at King's College, Cambridge. He and Izzy, and their two brothers, grew up surrounded by music. Their parents ran a music school in Hertfordshire. ""Rupert was an exceptionally gifted musician and he was so charismatic, full of life and vibrant,"" Izzy recalls. ""His ambition was to be a professional horn musician and I have no doubt he would have achieved that."" Rupert gradually began to physically recover and he was discharged from hospital. But the family soon realised he would always need 24-hour care. The now 45-year-old has problems with his memory and spatial awareness. He has no inhibitions and needs help doing basic tasks like washing and laundry, Izzy says. It feels like there is always someone missing, Izzy says, even though he is still here and the family is ""still grieving the loss of who he might have been"". Yet Rupert can still play his French horn to an exceptional standard, which Izzy describes as ""a miracle"". ""As a child he had this extraordinary gift, and that still lives on. If there was going to be anything that would allow him to connect with us, it would be music. It is in his bones, it pours out of him and it has ever since he was a little boy."" Rupert has spent the last 21 years living in a home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, run by Brainkind - a charity that cares for people with acquired brain injuries. He regularly performs with the Aylesbury concert band and still has the same brilliant technical ability, Izzy says. ""He can sometimes be disruptive during rehearsals, but they are so accepting of him and he is a really valued member of the group. ""When he plays there is such familiarity, so you can slip into a bit of normality for a moment and you almost forget what has happened."" Izzy went on to study at The Royal Academy of Music in London. She and her other two brothers became professional musicians. Izzy joined the electric string quartet Escala, who found fame in 2008 on Britain's Got Talent. She performed in the strings section for the band McFly on tour and began dating their drummer, Harry Judd. ""Harry has always been phenomenal with Rupert and that was one of the reasons I knew I wanted to marry him. Harry did not know Rupert before the accident so he takes him for who he is,"" she says. On their wedding day, Rupert performed a horn solo from John Williams's Somewhere in My Memory, which features in the film Home Alone. ""People were in awe. It takes your breath away when Rupert performs. I felt unbelievably proud, but also sad because he was on the path to such a huge career and he's not likely to have his own wedding day."" Izzy and Harry went on to have three children, which Izzy says triggered a lot of emotions about her brother. ""Rupert is very sweet with them and they are very close. My son Kit reminds me of Rupert as a young boy. He has the same zest for life and he pushes boundaries. It makes me think about the life that Rupert could be living."" Izzy did not pick up her violin for some time after having children and says she was ""a bit lost in early motherhood"". ""We struggled to start a family and then after I had Lola, Kit came along quickly and unexpectedly and life became a bit chaotic. ""When I had my youngest Lockie, I played the violin to soothe him one day and it really helped us both. I started to play different lullabies and my older two children started feeling calmer too."" When Izzy recently decided to go back in the studio to record a new album, which includes some of the lullabies she plays, she wanted to invite Rupert too. They recorded a new version of Somewhere In My Memory. Rupert is currently having brain scans after his memory started to decline, Izzy says, and there is a link between brain injuries and early onset dementia. It made her realise she might not have much time left to collaborate with her brother. ""I was worried that I neglected my relationship with Rupert after having children and we were not able to see him during Covid, but now I feel more at peace. ""Music has always been a language that my family has used when words were too difficult for us to speak. I wanted to reconnect with Rupert again and give him the space to share his talent. This has been very healing for me."" Izzy Judd and Rupert Johnston's single Somewhere in My Memory is out now. Izzy Judd's EP Moments is released on 16 February.

The TV presenter announced on Friday that the 56-year-old had died after living with extreme complications from Covid. In a video message on Good Morning Britain, Garraway said messages of support ""really does mean so much"". She added that they were of ""extraordinary comfort"" to her family. Draper, an author and former political adviser, married Garraway in 2005 and had two children with her, Darcey and Billy. He suffered long-lasting symptoms from coronavirus and required daily care, which Garraway chronicled in ITV documentaries. In a message to GMB viewers, Garraway said on Monday: ""I'm so lucky to feel connected to you all through these messages at this time when the raw pain of grief can be so isolating. ""I am certain that it is the support that you have given me and sent to Derek that has sustained us through these tough nearly four years, motivating us to fight on for each other and for those who can't fight for themselves and it will sustain us to continue that fight in the weeks and months and years to come. ""I look forward to waking up with you very soon again on Good Morning Britain to celebrate life in all its wonder and challenge again."" She continued: ""I hope you forgive me for taking some time to be at home. My family is so grateful that we could be with our dearest Derek in his final moments - something not all get to share. ""Maybe you too are going through grief yourself or have done in the past. I send love and support for you too. ""We are taking time to heal ourselves now that Darcey and Billy know their daddy is at peace and free from pain and struggle. I shall be thinking of you all until we are reunited very soon. ""In the meantime, hug your loved ones close. All my love, Kate."" On Friday former prime minister Sir Tony Blair led the tributes, describing Draper as a ""good colleague and great friend"". After being diagnosed with Covid, Draper was put into a coma in April 2020 and did not wake from it until the October of that year.

The East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) was placed on a national support programme in 2020 amid concerns over its leadership and culture. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) recognised the trust had expanded its safeguarding team and policies. Tom Abell, EEAST's chief executive, said the news was a ""major milestone"" and thanked staff for their commitment. He said: ""We have made much progress since I joined the trust over two years ago. When I joined, I made clear it would take time to tackle longstanding cultural and organisational issues. ""Although we have made good progress, we know there is still work to do to provide consistently excellent service to our communities."" Mr Abell added that the service's response times to incidents had ""halved over the course of the last couple of years or so"". The CQC said there had also been an improvement in the way allegations were handled, ""after processes were strengthened and standardised"". The trust had been on the National Recovery Support Programme for challenged providers and systems - formerly known as special measures - for almost four years. However, it will now leave the programme ""with immediate effect"". The latest CQC report, published in July 2022, showed significant improvements on long-standing cultural issues.

Friarwood Birth Centre temporarily shut in 2019 due to a midwife shortage, now the closure has been made permanent. The NHS said the number of births at Pontefract was ""lower than expected"" so it cannot justify midwives being deployed there. Local Labour MP Yvette Cooper blamed the decision on a lack of government investment. A NHS report said about 200 women a year gave birth at Pontefract before the unit's suspension and midwives continued to work at centres where the numbers were higher. The Mid Yorkshire NHS Hospitals Trust said maternity provision would continue to be offered at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, and a full range of antenatal and postnatal care would still be available at Pontefract Hospital. Women will also still have the choice of giving birth at home, based on clinical assessment. Anne-Marie Henshaw, director of midwifery at the trust, said recruiting midwives in the area was ""still a challenge"". ""We've worked really hard to attract, to recruit, to develop and to return our staff,"" she said. She added: ""At the moment the future looks positive in terms of workforce, although we recognise that there are regional and national fragilities in maternity workforce generally."" Ms Cooper said expectant women in the area were ""being badly let down"".

James Atkinson, 23, became unwell after eating food ordered from Dadyal in Newcastle on 10 July 2020. His flatmate Luke Isley told a hearing that he did not think Mr Atkinson, originally from Leeds, mentioned his allergy when he ordered via Deliveroo. The inquest has heard that the computer programmer died from anaphylaxis an hour after ingesting peanuts. Mr Isley, 26, also told the inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre that he did not think his friend contacted the restaurant directly to tell them about his allergy. He and another flatmate, Robert Raistrick, 27, gave evidence about what happened in their shared house in Jesmond that night. As little as 30 seconds after starting his first slice of the chicken tikka masala pizza, Mr Atkinson, a Newcastle University graduate, raised concerns about what he was eating, Mr Isley said. ""He said something about he was not sure about the pizza,"" he added. ""At first I thought maybe he didn't like it. ""When he first mentioned about nuts, that's when me and Rob started to panic."" Mr Raistrick, a software developer, recalled how Mr Atkinson quickly fell ill after starting to eat the pizza. ""He was concerned that his lips were tingling so he was aware quite soon,"" Mr Raistrick said. The two flatmates began to look for Mr Atkinson's EpiPen without success. Both had seen one in a house they had shared previously, but they could not find one in their current property. Mr Atkinson, who called the ambulance himself, was taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where efforts were made to resuscitate him. He died about 40 minutes after arrival, the inquest heard. Mr Raistrick said Mr Atkinson could not direct them to his EpiPen. He said: ""I don't believe he knew where it was either - I cannot be certain."" Coroner Karen Dilks asked Mr Isley if there had been any discussion about the type of food the friends would order and whether it was suitable for Mr Atkinson. Mr Isley said: ""When we were looking at menu options, James had mentioned about whether the type of pizza was likely to have nuts in it. ""James used his computer to see if that type of curry does have nuts in it."" Mrs Dilks asked Mr Isley if he had seen any warning on the Deliveroo app to contact the restaurant directly if someone had a query about allergens.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67732916,Midwife quit over 'unsafe care' and staffing,A former midwife has told the BBC she quit because she could not live with herself if she provided poor care.,2024-01-09,"A former midwife has told the BBC she quit because she could not live with herself if she provided poor care. Hannah Williams says staff shortages meant she kept patients safe, but sometimes only ""by the skin of her teeth"". BBC Verify analysis shows that the number of full-time equivalent midwife posts in England has gone up by 7% in the last decade. In comparison, the overall NHS workforce has increased by 34%. The country has a shortage of about 2,500 midwives, and maternity units are struggling with safety concerns. BBC research has also found that some trusts have more than one in five midwife jobs unfilled. The Royal College of Midwives says staffing is the ""most important issue"" and the gap needs to close. Maternity units are places where miracles can happen every day. We witnessed one at Croydon University Hospital, after meeting a nervous Nicole D'Cruze on the labour ward. She was about to have a planned caesarean section and allowed us to film the surgery. It was the perfect illustration of excellent NHS care - with the surgeon, anaesthetist, midwife and the rest of the surgical team working in harmony. As baby Zenia gave her first cry, a single tear, of joy and relief, rolled down her mum's face. But not every family gets such a positive start. In November, we reported that 67% of 178 units in England were not consistently meeting safety standards. To put that in context, this means maternity had the worst safety ratings of all hospital services inspected by regulator the Care Quality Commission. Since then, there has been a slight decline. Now seven in 10 units are not always safe enough. Phoebe Isaac and Hannah are two midwives with a lot in common. If you ask them to describe the moment a baby is born, their answers are almost identical, even down to their body language. Their eyes light up and they use the exact same word - ""privilege"". Phoebe, 22, qualified last summer and wants this to be her job for life. But at 35, Hannah walked away from the job she used to love. Together, they sum up both the problem - and the possible solutions - to the shortage of midwives: recruitment and retention. ""The future of midwifery"" is how her boss described Phoebe, who says she has got her dream career and feels very well-supported as a newly-qualified midwife. But the Croydon unit is working hard to fill a high number of empty midwife posts. This time last year, there were 40 full-time vacancies. The plan is to cut that down to 20 by March, partly by recruiting new starters like Phoebe. Still though, the team has to use agency staff to plug rota gaps and keep mothers and babies safe. Hannah worked in a maternity unit in a different part of the country and is keen to stress that she - and other midwives - always do their best. But she says they were often so short-staffed that she had to look after too many mothers and babies at the same time. She thinks she always managed to keep them safe, but looks close to tears as she says: ""I walked away from it because I couldn't live with myself if I provided unsafe care for someone because the staff numbers were unsafe. ""I miss it. But I also mourn it, because I don't see it improving."" The number of babies being born is falling - but births are becoming more complex. Ten years ago, 13% of deliveries were caesarean sections, but now it is 23%. This means mums and babies need longer stays in hospital and more care from midwives. Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), says the ""huge gaps in midwifery staffing levels"" are an historic issue because maternity services are often not prioritised. She says: ""What we're asking for is not to be at the back of the queue, not to be overlooked."" It is a tricky balance to train enough new midwives and retain those already in the job. The RCM is worried about a vicious circle -  staffing shortages mean existing midwives have to work harder, which can lead to them burning out and deciding to resign. ""We do need more midwives, and we need to keep the ones we've got. Being a midwife is probably one of the best professions in the world. And we really need to look after them,"" Gill says. We did a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to 106 trusts with maternity units. We asked how many full-time midwife posts they were budgeted to have in the summer of 2023 - and how many of those jobs were vacant. On average, 11% of midwife jobs were empty - which translates to 25 unfilled posts per trust. Several trusts had shortages of more than 20%, with the highest at 35%. Similar FOI requests to Wales and Northern Ireland showed that staffing there is less of an issue than in England, with averages of 6% and 9% of empty midwife posts respectively. Scotland's figures suggest a smaller gap of 4%, but it records workforce data differently to the other nations. Plans to train and hire more midwives are under way - and starting to have an impact. The government wants to increase the number of midwives in training by 13% between 2021-22 and 2024/-5. The Department of Health and Social Care says it has invested £165m a year to improve maternity and neonatal care - and that will soon go up to £186m. England's Chief Midwifery Officer Kate Brintworth is optimistic for the future. She says: ""Things already are improving. We've got 700 more midwives in post. Our retention rates are improving, staff are starting to feel that things are feeling better."" Are you a midwife? Please share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Researchers will see whether a ""capsule sponge"" can help prevent oesophageal cancer among those most at risk. Tim Cowper will take part in the BEST4 trial beginning at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge on Tuesday. The £6.4m project is jointly funded by Cancer Research UK and the National Institute for Health and Care Research. Oesophageal cancer is found anywhere in the oesophagus, sometimes called the gullet or food pipe. Mr Cowper, who works as a brewer, says he has suffered acid reflux, or heartburn, every night since he was 16. ""Since my diagnosis, I've been going for an endoscopy at least once every three years to monitor my oesophagus. It is not pleasant at all,"" said the 49-year-old, from Cambridge. ""Swallowing a capsule sponge is a much better experience."" The capsule sponge, known as the pill-on-a-thread, is a quick and simple test for Barrett's oesophagus, a condition that can be a precursor to cancer. Patients are asked to swallow the capsule containing the sponge, which dissolves in the stomach, but expands to the size of a 50p coin. The sponge is carefully pulled back up using the string, collecting cells for laboratory testing. The first stage of the trial is for people already diagnosed with Barrett's oesophagus and will look at whether the test could replace endoscopies to monitor their condition. The second stage of the trial, set for this summer, will recruit 120,000 people aged over 50 on long-term treatment for heartburn. If successful, it could become a national screening programme across the NHS, in the same way mammograms are used to screen for breast cancer. The trial builds on decades of research led by Professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, a doctor and researcher at Addenbrooke's and the University of Cambridge's Early Cancer Institute, who helped invent and refine the capsule sponge test. Prof Fitzgerald said the device ""could halve the number of deaths from oesophageal cancer every year"". She said: ""Most don't realise there's a problem until they have trouble swallowing. By then it is too late."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Abdullah became part of the Beacon trial when his neuroblastoma did not respond to chemotherapy. But adding a drug called Bevacizumab to his treatment significantly increased chances of his tumour shrinking, a new report indicates. The treatment is now standard for children with this cancer in the UK. Abdullah was aged four when he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in November 2017. An MRI scan showed a 4cm (1.5ins) tumour on his kidney and he was given a 30% chance of survival. His mother, Bushra, said: ""It was our last hope. There were no other options so we signed up thinking that, even if it didn't benefit Abdullah, it might help someone else."" However, the treatment meant his tumours had shrunk sufficiently to enable him undergo a life-saving stem cell transplant. The eight months of his life and death treatment are a distant memory for the 10-year-old, now a keen footballer, but the results of the clinical trial have just been published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The study of 160 children and young people, from 43 hospitals in 11 European countries, found the chances of responding to treatment increased from 18% to 26% if Bevacizumab was added to the regime. Bushra has thanked the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials unit in Birmingham for giving the family a ray of hope. ""If it hadn't been for this trial, we would have lost Abdullah, so we're incredibly grateful we were given another chance with the new treatment,"" she said. The combination of a drug which blocks tumours from forming blood vessels, alongside chemotherapy drugs, has led to better outcomes. Simon Gates, professor of Biostatistics and Clinical Trials at the University of Birmingham and senior lead author of the paper, said: ""These are very exciting results that hopefully get us closer to finding treatments for children who develop neuroblastomas. ""Currently, the outcomes are really poor for children who get this horrible cancer and so even seemingly small increases in the chance that a patient is going to be able to shrink their tumours is significant.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-67912753,Molesey and Thames Ditton GP redundancies due to 'new ways of working',Three doctors will be leaving a Surrey surgery after all of its salaried GPs were invited to apply for voluntary redundancy.,2024-01-09,"Three doctors will be leaving a Surrey surgery after all of its salaried GPs were invited to apply for voluntary redundancy. All 11 GPs at Glenlyn Medical Centre received a letter on 12 December informing them of ""the start of an HR process"". The three doctors will leave the surgery, which has sites in Molesey and Thames Ditton, at the end of March. Its managing director said the job cuts were due to changing patient demand. Joe Todd said the centre had identified a need to make changes after ""a number of recent improvements and the introduction of new ways of working"". He said this included a""significant increase"" in the number of online requests received and more virtual appointments. No other redundancies had been made but Mr Todd did not confirm whether there would need to be future job cuts. Mr Todd said he appreciated any change could feel worrying for patients. ""I would like to reassure patients that, by taking advantage of the wider team, and the wealth of experience and skills we now have at the practice, we will still be offering the same level of service, just in a different way, so people will still be able to access the services they need from us, when they need them,"" he added. New roles at the practice include pharmacists, advanced nursing and paramedic practitioners and paediatric nurses. They would help people get the care they needed from the right healthcare professional, Mr Todd said. He added: ""Many of these improvements are outlined in the NHS' national Primary Care Recovery Plan and, as we have started to work differently, we have needed to re-look at our staffing so we are aligned to deliver services in this new way.""

Until now, cancer patients have been marked with permanent ink - small dots or lines - to pinpoint the exact treatment area. It leaves a permanent reminder of what can be a long and stressful journey. Using 3D cameras to map a patient's body, the new technology also makes the process quicker and more precise. Olatunjie Williams is among the latest wave of cancer patients at Dorset's Poole Hospital to receive the new targeted way of delivering radiotherapy. He told the BBC: ""I'm receiving prostate cancer treatment - my father had it, my brother and I've got it."" Mr Williams said he had expected to be tattooed because he brother had been and was ""happy that I didn't have to have it"". Radiotherapy operational manager at the hospital John Payne described the new technology, which was previously only available privately. He said: ""When the patient goes on the treatment machine, the scan turns on and projects a red pattern of light on the patient, which is sent back to the computer. ""It can see where the patient is meant to be versus where the patient is and, within less than 1mm, you can put your patient exactly where they were when they had their radiotherapy planning."" Melissa Manrique, therapeutic radiographer, said it was ""fantastic"" for patients because it means there is no need for the ""invasive"" tattooing. She added: ""And it's nicer because they used to have to see them [the tattoos] on their skin and that may bring back some memories for them so it's quite nice to eliminate that factor.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-67911589,"Man died from peanut reaction after eating pizza, inquest hears","A man died from an allergic reaction to nuts one hour after eating a slice of takeaway pizza, an inquest has heard.",2024-01-09,"A man died from an allergic reaction to nuts one hour after eating a slice of takeaway pizza, an inquest has heard. James Atkinson, 23, became unwell after eating food ordered from the Newcastle restaurant Dadyal on 10 July 2020. A Home Office pathologist told the hearing that he died from anaphylaxis as a result of peanut ingestion. The inquest also heard that Mr Atkinson, originally from Leeds, told paramedics he was about to die before he fell unconscious. Mr Atkinson, who was a computer programmer living in Jesmond, Newcastle, had ordered a chicken tikka masala pizza, chips and Indian dishes with his flatmate via the delivery app Deliveroo. He had searched the internet for likely ingredients in certain foods, the inquest was told. The former Newcastle University student was said to have eaten some chips and less than one slice of the pizza before he realised something was wrong as he became rapidly unwell. While his flatmate looked for his EpiPen, unsuccessfully, Mr Atkinson rang for an ambulance. Craig Hassall KC, representing the family, said that when the paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson reportedly told them as he struggled to breathe that he was going to die. Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton outlined the background to her inquiry into his death, and said Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"" when the ambulance crew arrived. By the time he had been helped downstairs, he was assessed to have a Glasgow coma score of three, Dr Bolton said, and was ""profoundly unconscious"". Mr Atkinson was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle at 20:40 BST and died at 21:21 BST, despite the help of medics. Toxicology tests showed he had no alcohol or other drugs in his system at the time and so his decision-making ability was not impaired, the inquest heard. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson was known to be ""usually very good"" at monitoring his allergies, having been diagnosed with a peanut allergy 10 years earlier. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, Dr Bolton said. She gave the cause of death as anaphylaxis following peanut ingestion. Coroner Karen Dilks asked Dr Bolton if the outcome would have been different had an EpiPen been found to use on Mr Atkinson. The pathologist said: ""Even with the appropriate use of an EpiPen, there's no guarantee that an individual will survive, but it certainly increases your chances."" When Dr Bolton answered Mr Hassall's comment about Mr Atkinson saying he was going to die, she said: ""He experienced his difficulty in breathing and he was becoming aware it was getting worse, (and) individuals do sometimes say 'I am going to die'. ""Medically, that is taken very seriously. Everybody is still doing everything they can to stop that being the case, and, in fact, to prove the individual wrong."" Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son's ""sudden death has left an insurmountable hole in our hearts"". ""James had a gift of making others happy, checking in on friends and offering support when needed,"" they told the hearing. ""To be in his company with his amazing sense of humour and infectious laugh was a privilege. ""First on the dance floor and last to leave, James lived life to its fullest but also had a sensitive and thoughtful side,"" they continued. ""His whole family meant the world to him. He was loving, kind and caring,"" they added. The inquest, which is set to last two weeks, continues. Follow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-66134840,Captain Sir Tom Moore: What has happened to his legacy?,"With the charity set up in the name of Capt Sir Tom Moore the subject of a statutory inquiry and his daughter embroiled in a local planning row, the BBC looks at how the legacy of the man who won the nation's hearts stands in the nation's minds at the moment.",2024-01-09,"With the charity set up in the name of Capt Sir Tom Moore the subject of a statutory inquiry and his daughter embroiled in a local planning row, the BBC looks at how the legacy of the man who won the nation's hearts stands in the nation's minds at the moment. Captain Sir Tom Moore's extraordinary fundraising efforts for National Health Service charities are part of Covid-19 pandemic history, but the charity set up by his family in his honour is no longer taking donations. Just over a year ago, the Charity Commission launched an inquiry into the finances of the Captain Tom Foundation and a building which used the charity's name when it first got planning permission must now be torn down. Capt Sir Tom was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, in 1920. He served in India and Myanmar during World War Two, when it was known as Burma, but at the age of 99 he became an international star by walking laps around his garden. Early in April 2020, near the start of the coronavirus pandemic, he said he wanted to complete 100 laps of his patio before his 100th birthday at the end of that month, in an attempt to raise an initial £1,000 for the National Health Service. At the time, the NHS was under pressure dealing with thousands of Covid-19 patients, and with the nation in lockdown and wanting to help in some way, a determined old man and his walking frame captured a moment and people donated in their droves. He eventually raised a whopping £38m for NHS Charities Together, which works with a network of more than 230 NHS Charities across the UK to support the organisation. Not only did his efforts encourage thousands to donate, but he inspired many to join his campaign. A week before his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person ever to get to number one in the UK singles charts, when his duet of You'll Never Walk Alone - with singer Michael Ball - took the top spot. His 100th birthday on 30 April 2020 was marked with an RAF flypast, personal birthday greetings from the Queen and prime minister, and he was made an honorary colonel of the British Army. On 17 July 2020, he was knighted for his fundraising efforts in the grounds of Windsor Castle. In October 2023, PR specialist Daisy Souster, who helped the family launch the initial charity appeal said she was ""cut out"" by the family and was told by Capt Sir Tom's daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, that she had ""no right"" to talk about her role. Ms Ingram-Moore has not responded to the BBC's request for comment about this issue. Capt Sir Tom died in February 2021 aged 100, with coronavirus. He had become ill not long after his family took him on holiday to Barbados in December 2020 after British Airways paid for his flight, and he tested positive for Covid-19 in hospital in January. His family said due to other medication he was receiving for pneumonia, he had been unable to be vaccinated. After his death, the Captain Tom Foundation was set up by his family to support ""causes close to Captain Sir Tom's heart"" - many of which are detailed on the charity's website including the Florence Nightingale Hospice in Buckinghamshire, the Willen Hospice in Milton Keynes and national organisation Mind. In February 2022, the Charity Commission announced it would be reviewing the accounts of the charity. Grants of £160,000 were given to four charities by the Foundation in its first year, but it had paid more than £162,000 in management costs in the same period. According to the published accounts, covering the charity's first year from 5 May 2020 to 31 May 2021, it paid out grants to four charities worth £40,000 each, but spent £209,433 on support costs - including the £162,336 on ""management"". The financial statement also showed reimbursement costs of £16,097 paid to Club Nook Limited - a company run by Hannah Ingram-Moore, the younger of Capt Sir Tom's two daughters, set up shortly before the formation of the charity. The Foundation had said it welcomed the Charity Commission's input. In June 2022, the Commission said it had launched an inquiry into the foundation amid concerns his family may have profited from using his name. It said it was concerned about the charity's independence from Club Nook, as well as the trustees' decision-making and how the Foundation was governed. In August 2023, a BBC Newsnight investigation found that thousands of pounds was paid to Maytrix Group, a company owned by Ms Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin, for appearances by her in connection with the Captain Tom Foundation charity - and not to the foundation itself. She did not respond to those claims but when the foundation's latest accounts were published in September 2023, showing that the watchdog's intervention into the charity had a ""massive adverse impact"" on fundraising, she posted a statement on her verified Instagram account. Income had been more than £1m for the 2020-2021 financial year, but fell to £402,854 from June 2021 to November 2022. Ms Ingram-Moore said she had not been involved in the foundation ""in any capacity"" since April 2022, and had not made any payments from the charity's bank account during her time as interim chief executive. In an interview on TalkTV's Piers Morgan Uncensored in October 2023, Ms Ingram-Moore said the family kept the profits from three books that Captain Sir Tom wrote for themselves - at her father's request. In the prologue to his autobiography, Tomorrow will be a Good Day, which came out in 2020, he said that ""with the offer to write this memoir I have also been given the chance to raise even more money"" for the foundation. But Ms Ingram-Moore said there had been no agreement with her father that book money - reportedly £800,000 - would go to charity. There is no suggestion that she has acted illegally by keeping the money, rather than donating it to her late father's charity. In the same interview, she said her family had received death threats and were left feeling ""devastated"" by negative reactions to them. In July 2023 the charity announced that it was not actively seeking donations or making payments. It said its ""sole focus...is to ensure that it cooperates fully with the on-going statutory inquiry by the Charity Commission"". A statement added that when the inquiry concluded it would ""be in a better position to make a decision in relation to its future"". At a planning appeal in hearing in October 2023, to decide a separate matter regarding a controversial spa built in the family's garden, their lawyer Scott Stemp said the foundation was ""unlikely to exist"" in the future, following the Charity Commission's investigation. The foundation's announcement came as it was reported that Ms Ingram-Moore, who lived with Capt Sir Tom in The Old Rectory, a Grade II listed building in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, was told to knock down an unauthorised building used as a home spa. The building on the site of the family home - originally approved for the use of the occupiers and the Captain Tom Foundation - had received planning permission in August 2021 and had been partly constructed when revised plans were submitted in February 2022, which included a spa pool, toilets and a kitchen ""for private use"". The revised plans for what was called the Captain Tom Building were turned down by Central Bedfordshire Council in November 2022. A demolition order for the now-unauthorised building was issued, the council said. The Planning Inspectorate confirmed an appeal had been received and held an in-person hearing on 17 October 2023, attended by the family. In documents submitted for the appeal, the family said the structure was ""no more overbearing than the consented scheme"". Colin Ingram-Moore said there were ""no grounds supporting the refusal of the retrospective application"" and asked the inspectorate to uphold the family's appeal. At the hearing, their chartered surveyor said the project had ""evolved"" to include the spa pool which ""has the opportunity to offer rehabilitation sessions for elderly people in the area"". A neighbour argued that the building was ""49% bigger than what was consented"". On 7 November, the Planning Inspectorate announced it had dismissed the appeal. In a letter announcing the decision, planning inspector Diane Fleming said the ""scale and massing"" of the partially-built structure had ""resulted in harm"" to The Old Rectory and that the ""suggested public benefit would not outweigh the great weight to be given to the harm to the heritage asset"". The family had three months to comply with the existing demolition order although there was a period of six weeks during which the decision could be challenged in the High Court. The deadline to lodge a High Court appeal passed in December and the Planning Inspectorate has confirmed that no such application had been received. The family must now comply with the existing demolition order which means that the spa must come down by 7 February. Central Bedfordshire Council has confirmed it will ""review the onsite position on 8 February"". Neither the Captain Tom Foundation nor Ms Ingram-Moore have responded to the BBC's request for comment on the planning application or the subsequent appeal decision. In Ms Ingram-Moore's September 2023 statement, she said no charity money had been used in the construction of the new building. The £38m gained from Capt Tom's walks - managed and distributed by NHS Charities Together - was ""not under investigation"", the charity confirmed. NHS Charities Together said money it received for its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal had ""funded thousands of projects"". It said its appeal had raised more than £160m from thousands of supporters, which had been ""distributed across the network of NHS charities to reach every NHS Trust and Health Board in the UK"". ""It has funded thousands of projects and provided vital mental health support for NHS staff, training for emergency volunteers, equipment and support for patients, and community partnership programmes to prevent ill health and reduce pressure on NHS services,"" the charity said. It has stressed that the Captain Tom Foundation is a ""completely separate organisation"". The September Instagram statement from Ms Ingram-Moore said all the money raised from her father's walk had been given directly to NHS charities and the family had ""never been involved in any discussion or decision on this disbursement"".

The BBC spoke to an oral surgery team about this lesser-known cancer, and two women who want to raise awareness of the devastating impact it can have. It's 09:30 GMT and the operating theatre is being prepared for Deborah Horsley. She is about to have her eighth operation since finding an ulcer on her tongue in 2009. ""My GP treated it as thrush, but six months later it didn't go, he tried it with something else, then I got sent for a biopsy,"" said Ms Horsley. ""So that's when I found out the first time [that I had cancer]: I was devastated. ""It's now gone on to my gum, so I am having that removed today."" Despite her pre-surgery nerves, Ms Horsley was keen to talk about the disease that has ""taken over"" her life. ""I want to highlight it, because a lot of people don't know about mouth cancer,"" she added. ""If I can help one person that would be good."" Unfortunately, the exploratory operation discovered her cancer had spread to the bone, with Ms Horsley looking at extensive surgery, reconstruction of the lower jaw and possibly radiotherapy as well. According to Cancer Research UK, about 880 people are diagnosed with mouth cancer in the East of England each year, and rates have increased by 26% across England in the past 10 years. The charity said there had been a rise of 13% in cases of oral cancer in the 40-49 age category in England during the same period. It said rates for the age category of 20-39 ""remain steady"". However, Richard James, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for almost two decades, said while his patient numbers appeared unchanged, he was seeing more and more people who did not have the usual risk factors of age, smoking and alcohol. ""We've seen an increasing number of younger patients every year,"" he added. ""Going back over 20 years, we did see a number of patients in their teenage years, but that is relatively small number. ""Patients in their 20s, 30s and 40s - yes, we are seeing an increasing number, which is obviously very concerning. ""We are seeing a number of patients who don't smoke and consume relatively small amounts of alcohol, but the exact reason has never really been determined. ""Maybe there could be some genetic factors, there could be a whole host of reasons. ""Certainly not being able to see dentists, not being able to see primary care could be an issue for a lot of patients and certainly its something that we would like to see corrected. ""The earlier we detect and treat mouth cancer, the better."" Registrar Sarah-Jane Miles was assisting Mr James in theatre, a year after she was diagnosed with tongue cancer. Her treatment was successful and she was able to get back to her training. ""I feel incredibly fortunate - I am working and for a long time I was concerned that may not be a possibility,"" she said. ""I think it gave me a different way of looking at things, from a patient perspective. ""Obviously I have the medical training, but it's different when you are going through things yourself and the challenges you have to overcome to get back to everyday life."" Barbara Fountain, of Norwich, is keen to ensure support is there for people with mouth cancer, particularly for younger patients. She was 32 when she was diagnosed with tongue cancer by Mr James on New Year's Eve 2018, having been referred by her dentist. ""At that moment, everything slowed down,"" she said. ""I looked at my husband's face and it was like shattered glass, and I could see his world completely turned upside down. ""It was only when I met my Macmillan nurse, who touched my arm, that I realised 'oh this is actually happening to me'."" She made a good recovery from a 12-hour operation to remove a quarter of her tongue, which was rebuilt using part of her arm. Five years on from her diagnosis, and she regards herself as ""super lucky"". She set up Young Tongues, initially as a network to help her connect with people like herself. Source: NHS It now links patients around the world and, she hopes, could inspire targeted research. ""Having tongue cancer was an incredibly isolating experience for me, because I didn't have people to relate to,"" she said. ""When I found my first three or four people on Instagram I was really excited, but suddenly we were 100, then we were 500. ""I saw there was a real need for age-appropriate support and to make sure as a young person you feel heard. ""It's really important that as a young person if you have a mouth ulcer or a bump and it's not healing after three weeks that you ask [your GP], and ask again. ""We need money to find out why this increase is happening, and what's driving it so we don't end up with a tongue cancer crisis in 10 or 20 years,"" she added.

Morgan-Rose Hart, 18, who had ADHD, autism and a history of mental illness had been a patient at a unit in Harlow, Essex, for three weeks. An inquest jury concluded she died by misadventure contributed to by neglect. Essex County Council said it would respond to coroner Sonia Hayes' report. Ms Hart, from Chelmsford, died in hospital six days after she was found unresponsive in the bathroom of her mental health accommodation in the Derwent Centre in Harlow, Essex in July 2022. The inquest into her death heard staff observations were falsified and critical observations were missed. In her Prevention of Future Deaths report, Ms Hayes said: ""There is a significant shortfall of appropriate placements for people with autism who have mental health and self-harm risks in Essex both inpatient and in the community."" She added: ""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. ""In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken."" The report has been sent to Essex County Council and Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT). A spokesperson for EPUT, which runs the unit in which Ms Hart was a patient, said: ""Our condolences remain with Morgan-Rose's loved ones following their tragic loss. ""We remain absolutely committed to ensuring improvements are embedded throughout the organisation, so that all patients receive the high quality and compassionate care they deserve. ""We are thoroughly reviewing the coroner's findings and will respond to the report in full in due course.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67894937,Back-to-school illness advice offered to parents,Parents are being urged to take five simple steps to keep their children healthy as the new school term begins.,2024-01-09,"Parents are being urged to take five simple steps to keep their children healthy as the new school term begins. Advice from health officials ranges from teaching good hygiene habits to stopping the spread of bugs and knowing when to keep your child at home. Winter often sees a rise in common viruses like chickenpox, norovirus and flu which can keep children off school. UK health officials say by following the advice parents can protect them as well as the wider community. Their advice comes as many children return to school for the spring term - but it is also when they are most likely to miss lessons. ""The winter period can see an increase in some of the common seasonal viruses which disrupt children's education and cause more serious illnesses,"" says Dr Catherine Falconer from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The advice is to: 1. Teach good hygiene habits, such as regular hand-washing It is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of viruses, the experts say, because they can live on our hands. Use soap and warm water for 20 seconds or hand sanitiser to clean hands regularly. And to stop infections spreading, use tissues to catch coughs and sneezes, bin them afterwards and then wash hands (again). 2. Stop the spread of stomach bugs Sickness bugs such as norovirus and E. coli are on the up, and that means more children could have diarrhoea and vomiting. If affected, using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will help prevent bugs from spreading (along with washing hands with soap). The UKHSA says not to prepare food for others if you have symptoms, or for 48 hours after they stop. And it advises people to avoid visiting vulnerable relatives in care homes and hospitals to avoid passing anything on to them, and not to return to work, school or nursery until two days after symptoms end. 3. Know when to keep your child at home Children should stay at home from school or nursery if they have a high temperature (fever) and are unwell, and wait until it has passed before going back. A child with diarrhoea and/or vomiting should also wait for 48 hours before going back, to stop the spread of stomach bugs. But if they have a runny nose, sore throat or slight cough - without a high temperature - children are encouraged to go to school, nursery or childcare. Scarlet fever and chickenpox can also spread at this time of year, and cases usually peak in late winter and early spring, health officials say. Scarlet fever symptoms include: Contact your local GP if you see the signs and keep children away from school and nursery for 24 hours after the first dose of antibiotics. Chickenpox is highly contagious - the most common symptom is an itchy, spotty rash. Keep children off school until all the spots have crusted over. 4. Get vaccinated There is a ""quick and painless"" nasal spray for children which offers the best protection against flu, UKHSA says. However, it says vaccine uptake among pre-school children is lower than other groups, despite the illness sometimes being more serious for this age group. Find out if your child is eligible for a flu vaccine in Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There has also been a drop in uptake of other childhood vaccinations, which protect against diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria and polio. The advice is to make sure make sure your child is up to date with all their vaccinations. 5. Take online advice from NHS resources The health service has plenty of advice for parents, such as:","['Primary schools', 'Children', 'Schools', 'Health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13D77/production/_132217218_gettyimages-612409562.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EF57/production/_132217216_gettyimages-146860313.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/311B/production/_132217521_gettyimages-138710985.jpg']",['Philippa Roxby'],Health,Health
https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-67913027,The Receipts Podcast: Tolly T and Audrey address Milena Sanchez rift,"Former presenter of The Receipts Podcast Milena Sanchez says she quit after ""years of a rift"" with a co-host.",2024-01-09,"Former presenter of The Receipts Podcast Milena Sanchez says she quit after ""years of a rift"" with a co-host. She left the podcast in October after seven years working alongside Audrey Indome and Tolani Shoneye. In the first episode since, the pair denied they ""banded together"" to squeeze out Milena and said they were hurt by her decision to leave. Responding on social media, Milena said she was unhappy and had been at her ""wits' end"" when she quit. When she announced she was leaving, Milena said it had been a ""difficult decision that has weighed heavy on my heart for some time"", not giving any further reasons. And in Monday's episode, Tolani, known as Tolly T, said ""something happened"" between them, without providing details. After she raised the situation with Milena, she said, her co-host emailed within days to say she was leaving. ""There was no confrontation, there was no chat about what happened... it was just kind of like, 'hey I'm leaving',"" Tolani said. Sharing her side on X/Twitter, Milena said the feud was sparked by a conversation with a third party where she spoke about ""the dynamics of the podcast and how unhappy I was"". But she said the row was ""the cherry on top"" after ""years of a rift between myself and Tolly which was clear to see"". ""To try and play off that I left the bag and something we built over seven years because of one situation doesn't make sense,"" Milena said. Tolly also denied rumours she had bullied Milena, telling listeners: ""One thing I'm not is a bully"", adding she also isn't ""allowed to be a victim"". ""People need a narrative for their world to make sense, there has to be a villain and there has to be a victim. I'm the bad guy so your world makes sense."" Tolly added that she felt ""massively hurt and betrayed"", not wanting things ""to end in this way"". Audrey, who was on maternity leave at the time and has since given birth to her daughter, said she was ""dumbfounded"" by the news of Milena's departure. ""I definitely felt we were owed a lot more respect because regardless of what anyone else says, there was a sisterhood, there was a friendship,"" she said. The Receipts Podcast launched in 2016 and currently has about 100,000 weekly listeners on Spotify after it signed an exclusive deal with the streaming platform in 2019. It was created to be a space for black women to discuss a wide range of topics, and is known for having unfiltered conversations. After discussing Milena's departure for about 30 minutes, Audrey and Tolly said they wished their former co-host the best.
