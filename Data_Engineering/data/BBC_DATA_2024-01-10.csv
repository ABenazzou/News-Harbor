https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67932725,US and UK hint at military action after largest Houthi attack in Red Sea,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping.",2024-01-10,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping. Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night. The allies warned of ""consequences"" for such attacks. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Watch this space."" The Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel. The have repeatedly claimed - often falsely - that they are attacking merchant vessels linked to Israel in protest at Israeli actions during the war in Gaza. Tuesday's attack was the 26th on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November. The US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT). Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond. HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said. No injuries or damage were reported. Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving ""a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones"". ""It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel],"" he said. ""The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces,"" he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would ""not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation"". Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to ""prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very concerned"" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the ""risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East"". The UN Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution on Wednesday evening demanding the Houthis stop targeting maritime traffic in the Red Sea. Something has to change in the Red Sea. The current situation is unsustainable, both economically and militarily. From a purely fiscal standpoint there is a massive mismatch between the cost of a Houthi drone (roughly £17,000) and a Royal Navy Sea Viper missile (£1m plus) used to destroy incoming missiles. Different weapons are used by both sides, with the Houthis also deploying more expensive anti-ship ballistic missiles and uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), ie explosive boat drones. But thanks to Iranian help, the Houthis have a large supply of missiles and drones that they can use in a ""swarm attack"", hoping to overwhelm the air defences of Western warships. A new report today by the UK defence think tank Rusi says the Houthis are likely being provided with intelligence by an Iranian surveillance ship in the Red Sea, the MV Behshad. The pressure on the crews of warships now deployed on the US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian in the Red Sea is also immense. As former Royal Navy commanders have pointed out, there can be as little as 30 seconds' warning between the detection of an incoming supersonic missile and its impact. These are all reasons why, if the Houthis persist in these attacks, then direct military action against them is possibly imminent. Listen to more from Frank on The Global Story. Mr Shapps warned in a statement on Wednesday morning that the UK and its allies had ""previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"". ""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy,"" he added. Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was ""behind so much of the bad things happening in the region"" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be ""consequences"" if the attacks on shipping did not stop. Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: ""I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'."" He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"" last month to protect Red Sea shipping. They said the attacks posed ""a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways"". It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' ""watch this space"" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident. Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to ""telegraph"" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression. They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships. While he may have declined to go into details, our correspondent says it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine that the ""consequences"" and the ""response"" Mr Blinken discussed in Bahrain will not translate into a use of military force. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority. In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.","['Royal Navy', 'Shipping industry', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Grant Shapps', 'Global trade', 'Houthis', 'United States', 'Yemen']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86A2/production/_132266443_redsea.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6C62/production/_123464772_frankgardner_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/89B8/production/_132065253_thumbnail_bab_al_mandab_strait_2x640-nc.png']","['By David Gritten', 'BBC News']",Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67929397,'Deep concern' for patients and staff at Gaza's al-Aqsa hospital,"Doctors from the UK who have been working at what they say is the only functioning hospital in the central Gaza Strip have told the BBC of their ""deep concern"" for patients and staff remaining there - as fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas has reportedly intensified in nearby areas.",2024-01-10,"Doctors from the UK who have been working at what they say is the only functioning hospital in the central Gaza Strip have told the BBC of their ""deep concern"" for patients and staff remaining there - as fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas has reportedly intensified in nearby areas. Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who has been working at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said the fighting meant there has been ""a real decrease"" in the number of staff able to work at the facility over the past two weeks. At the same time, she said some 600 to 700 patients were still being treated inside the hospital daily, and that hundreds of displaced people were sheltering there or in the immediate vicinity. ""Without any functioning or sufficient healthcare staff, it will be an unmitigated disaster for those people living in Middle Gaza,"" another member of the team, surgeon Nick Maynard, told the BBC. When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: ""The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there."" Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them. On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been ""forced to withdraw and cease activities"" as a result of what they called ""increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital"". The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had ""received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave"". He stated that al-Aqsa was ""the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"". ""Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage,"" he warned. Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday. ""I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)."" He added: ""We were told we had to leave."" Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves. The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was ""not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question"". Another doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days. ""It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away,"" he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard. Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details. And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead. The BBC has asked the IDF for comment. The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing. Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a ""dangerous combat zone"" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital. The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves. Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone. The IDF said ""no specific evacuation notice had been given to"" al-Aqsa. Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed. Dr Smith said: ""Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital. ""Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday."" He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital. ""There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital."" Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital. The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed ""horrific"" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital. ""We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash,"" Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. ""We just had to use alcohol gel before operating."" ""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean. ""Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching,"" he added. Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: ""There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold. ""Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity."" She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief. ""I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said. ""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor."" Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries. ""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged."" The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that ""intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea"" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas. ""The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza,"" it warned. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them. The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Palestinian territories', 'Hamas', 'Israel']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147FE/production/_132266938_baby.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8134/production/_132267033_gaza_basic_al_aqsa_hospital-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0C04/production/_132267030_notes2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3A76/production/_132266941_blood2.jpg']","['By Alys Davies', 'BBC News']",Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64192508,"What are El Niño and La Niña, and how do they change the weather?","It has been confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year on record, driven by human-caused warming but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Niño.",2024-01-10,"It has been confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year on record, driven by human-caused warming but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Niño. The effects of El Niño could also see record temperatures in 2024. El Niño is part of the natural climate phenomenon called the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It has two opposite states - El Niño and La Niña - both of which significantly alter global weather. An El Niño event is typically declared when sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise to at least 0.5C above the long-term average. In normal conditions, surface water in the Pacific Ocean is cooler in the east and warmer in the west. The ""trade winds"" tend to blow east-to-west, and heat from the Sun progressively warms the waters as they move in this direction. During El Niño events, these winds weaken or reverse, sending warm surface waters eastwards instead. In La Niña periods, the normal east-to-west winds become stronger, pushing warmer waters further west. This causes cold water to rise up - or ""upwell"" - from the depths of the ocean, meaning sea surface temperatures are cooler than usual in the east Pacific. The phenomenon was first observed by Peruvian fisherman in the 1600s, who noticed that warm waters seemed to peak near the Americas in December. They nicknamed the event ""El Niño de Navidad"" - Christ Child in Spanish. Not every ENSO event is the same, and the consequences vary from region to region. However, scientists have observed some common effects: Temperatures Global temperatures typically increase during an El Niño episode, and fall during La Niña. El Niño means warmer water spreads further, and stays closer to the surface. This releases more heat into the atmosphere, creating wetter and warmer air. But the regional effects are complicated, and some places may be both warmer and cooler than expected at different points in the year. The hottest year on record, 2023, was boosted by El Niño conditions, on top of long-term human-caused warming. Between 2020 and 2022, the world experienced an unusually long period of La Niña conditions, which helped keep a lid on global temperatures. How UK and Western European temperatures respond to El Niño is complicated and uncertain. It could mean colder than average winters, for example, but that depends on how El Niño unfolds. Changes to rainfall During El Niño events, the warmer water pushes the Pacific jet stream's strong air currents further to the south and the east. This brings wetter weather to southern USA and the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical regions like southeast Asia, Australia and central Africa typically experience drier conditions. Under La Niña, the effect is reversed. Tropical storms El Niño also affects atmospheric circulation patterns, which means there are generally more tropical storms in the tropical Pacific, but fewer in the tropical Atlantic, including the southern US. During La Niña, the reverse is typically true. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels Scientists have also observed that CO2 levels in the atmosphere increase during El Niño events, possibly as a result of warmer and drier conditions in tropical regions. If plants grow less quickly due to drought, they absorb less CO2, while more wildfires in places like South Asia mean more CO2 is released. The extreme weather events worsened by El Niño and La Niña affect infrastructure, food and energy systems around the world. For example, when less cold water comes to the surface off the west coast of South America during El Niño events, fewer nutrients rise from the bottom of the ocean. That means there is less food available for marine species like squid and salmon, in turn reducing stocks for South American fishing communities. The droughts and flooding caused by the extreme 2015-16 El Niño event affected the food security of more than 60 million people, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation. A recent study suggested that El Niño events significantly reduce global economic growth, an effect which could intensify in the future. El Niño and La Niña episodes typically occur every two to seven years, and usually last nine to 12 months. They don't necessarily alternate: La Niña events are less common than El Niño episodes. In 2021, the UN's climate scientists, the IPCC, said the ENSO events which have occurred since 1950 are stronger than those observed between 1850 and 1950. But it also said that tree rings and other historical evidence show there have been variations in the frequency and strength of these episodes since the 1400s. The IPCC concluded there is no clear evidence that climate change has affected these events. Some climate models do suggest that El Niño events will become more frequent and more intense as a result of global warming - potentially boosting temperatures further. But this is not certain.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-67836727,Derbyshire farmer fears he will be turfed off land for solar farm,A Derbyshire farmer fears he could lose his livelihood if plans for a solar farm go ahead.,2024-01-10,"A Derbyshire farmer fears he could lose his livelihood if plans for a solar farm go ahead. Andrew Dakin is the third generation of tenant farmers who have worked the land at Kidsley Farm, near Heanor. But plans for a new solar farm could see all his farming land sold off and solar panels put in place instead. Mr Dakin said it would be impossible for him to continue farming if Amber Valley Borough Council granted permission for the solar farm. The solar farm, which would be built on Mr Dakin's land, is one of two applications for neighbouring solar farms north of Derby and Smalley, which would sit 500m apart and cover an area of 328 acres. Mr Dakin said the farm on his land, which would span 180 acres, would take away all the fields he uses to rear cattle for beef and leave only the house he lives in. He told the BBC he would be enormously sad if he was forced to stop farming. He said: ""It's a way of life. It means absolutely everything and it would be devastating to see it go for a solar farm. ""It's all I've ever done - I've never been on holiday since I was 15 because I love being on the farm and I don't want to be anywhere else."" A spokesman for the solar farm developer, Intelligent Alternatives, said issues relating to land ownership and tenancy were private commercial matters. He said building on greenbelt land was allowed in special circumstances, such as tackling climate change, and pledged the land would be reinstated for agriculture afterwards. The spokesman added the full planning applications would not be submitted until after January and the community and councils would be kept informed. Amy Wheelton, who is a tenant farmer and local councillor who also sits on South Derbyshire District Council's planning committee, said she was alarmed at the number of applications being made for solar farms on agricultural land. ""Solar can be good,"" she said. ""I've no argument with somebody wanting to put it on their chicken sheds or their business. ""But you can have farmers that have been three generations farming, as I have on my tenanted land - some have invested millions in their businesses - and like that it's gone. ""There's no security of tenure and it's just wrong."" Ms Wheelton has solar panels covering her office rooftops and said it was ""crackers"" to use agricultural land for solar farms, as there was enough south-facing roof space in the UK to produce half the country's energy needs. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said the issue of tenant farmers being turfed off their land for solar farms was a ""huge and growing issue"" and called for a national database of solar schemes to illustrate the scale of the issue. He said: ""People are losing their businesses here for a pittance in terms of compensation. ""We're worried that food security is being damaged by the amount of land we're potentially going to see lost to solar schemes. ""We would much prefer this being put on to roofs of buildings and farm buildings and having microgeneration rather than these huge schemes taking the best and most versatile agricultural land out of production."" However, Sam Richards of Britain Remade, said moving quickly to renewable energy ""simply has to happen"". He said: ""If we truly believe that we have a climate emergency, if we really want to cut our energy bills, then fundamentally we're going to need to build.""

It marks the fall from grace of one of Liberia's most famous judges and politicians, who prided herself as a champion of women rights. Musu-Scott, 70, is now in jail, hoping to overturn the ruling on appeal. A judge sentenced the retired judge after a jury convicted her for the murder of Charloe Musu, 29. Musu-Scott's trial heard that she - along with three other women - had ""wilfully, intentionally, purposely and maliciously inflicted several bodily injuries"" on her niece at her home last June. Musu had suffered wounds to her chest, right hand, left thigh, and left armpit after being stabbed with a sharp instrument, believed to be a knife, the indictment alleged. The former chief justice denied the charge, saying the 29-year-old had been killed by an ""assassin"" who had entered her home in the capital, Monrovia. Her arrest came as a shock to many Liberians and her trial was closely followed, especially as it came in the build-up to December's presidential election. Musu-Scott was a prominent member of President-elect Joseph Boakai's political party, and was part of its high-powered legal team which successfully challenged the election commission's refusal to allow parties to see the voters' roll. Her relatives, friends and supporters wept after Judge Roosevelt Z Willie sentenced her and the three other women, aged 80, 36 and 20, local media reported. She served as Liberia's justice minister and then as its most senior judge - the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court - until her retirement in 2003. She later entered politics, and was a lawmaker in Maryland County until 2012, according to the African Women in Law website. In 2012, she was appointed the chairperson of the Constitutional Review Committee, as Liberia tried to strengthen democracy and good governance following the authoritarian rule and conflicts of the past. Her lawyer Augustine Fayiah told the BBC he would appeal against her conviction and sentencing within the coming days. The appeal would list the ""errors"" of the judge, and show that jurors did not acting independently, he said. ""Their decisions were tempered with by justice ministry officials,"" the lawyer alleged.

Warning: Contains details some readers may find distressing ""My dad had fear, constant fear. He was very afraid that someone would speak up,"" says one of the pastor's daughters, Ajoke - one of the first whistle-blowers to reach out to the BBC about the abuse she witnessed at her father's church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan). TB Joshua, who died in 2021 at the age of 57, is accused of widespread abuse and torture spanning almost 20 years. Now aged 27, Ajoke lives in hiding and has dropped her surname ""Joshua"" - the BBC is not publishing her new name. Little is known about Ajoke's birth mother, who was believed to be one of TB Joshua's congregants. Ajoke says she was raised by Evelyn, Joshua's widow, from as early as she can remember. Until the age of seven, Ajoke says she had a very happy childhood, going on holiday with the Joshua family to places like Dubai. But one day everything changed. She was suspended from school for a misdemeanour, and a local journalist wrote an article referring to her as the illegitimate child of TB Joshua. She was pulled out of school and taken to the Scoan compound in Lagos. ""I was made to move to the disciples' room. I didn't volunteer to be a disciple. I was made to join,"" she says. The disciples were an elite group of dedicated followers who served TB Joshua and lived with him inside the maze-like structure of the church. They came from all over the world, many staying at the compound for decades. They lived under a strict set of rules: forbidden to sleep for more than a few hours at a time, prohibited from using their own phones or having access to their personal emails, and forced to call TB Joshua ""Daddy"". ""The disciples were both brainwashed and enablers. Everybody was just acting based on command - like zombies. Nobody was questioning anything,"" she says. Just a child, Ajoke would not follow the rules like the other disciples: she refused to stand up when the pastor came into the room and rebelled against the severe sleeping orders. The abuse started soon after. Not long after arriving, aged seven, she remembers being beaten for wetting the bed and then being forced to walk around the compound with a sign around her neck saying ""I am a bedwetter."" ""The message about Ajoke was that she had terrible evil spirits that needed to be driven out,"" says one former female disciple. ""There was a time in the disciple meetings - he [Joshua] said people could beat her. Anyone in the female dormitory could just hit her and I remember just seeing people slapping her as they walked past,"" she says. From the moment Ajoke moved to the church in the Ikotun neighbourhood of Lagos, she was treated like an outcast. ""She was, like, kind of labelled the black sheep of the family,"" says Rae, from the UK, who spent 12 years living in the church as a disciple. Like most of the former disciples interviewed by the BBC, she opted to only use her first name. Rae remembers a time when Ajoke slept for too long, and Joshua shouted at her to get up. Another disciple took her to the shower and ""whipped her with an electrical cord and then turned the hot water on"", she says. Recalling the incident, Ajoke says: ""I was screaming at the top of my voice, and they just let the water run on my head for a very long time."" Such abuse was never-ending, she says. ""We're talking about years and years of abuse. Consistent abuse. My existence as a child from another mother undermined everything he [TB Joshua] claimed to stand for."" The abuse escalated to a different scale when she was aged 17 and confronted her dad about ""accounts, first hand, of people who had experienced sexual abuse"". ""I saw female disciples go up to his room. They were going away for hours. I was hearing things: 'Oh this happened to me. He tried sleeping with me.' Too many people were saying the same thing,"" she says. The BBC spoke to more than 25 former disciples - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - who gave powerful corroborating testimony of experiencing or witnessing sexual abuse. ""I couldn't take it any more. I walked directly into his office on that very day. I shouted at the top of my voice: 'Why are you doing this? Why are you hurting all these women?' ""I had lost every iota of fear for this man. He tried to stare me down, but I was looking in his eyes,"" she says. Emmanuel, who was part of the church for 21 years and spent more than a decade living in the compound as a disciple, remembers that day clearly.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-10,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations's top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. But last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South African Jewish leaders his government ""stands with the people of Palestine, who have endured over seven decades of apartheid-type… brutal occupation"".

The personnel were third-party contractors, the report said. The nationalities of those on board have not been specified, nor the exact number involved. Al-Shabab controls large parts of southern and central Somalia. The group is affiliated to al-Qaeda and has waged a brutal insurgency for nearly 20 years. The seizure of the helicopter was confirmed to the BBC by Galmudug region Security Minister Mohamed Abdi Adan. Several foreigners and two locals were on the helicopter, Somali military official Major Hassan Ali told Reuters news agency. ""It was also carrying medical supplies and it was supposed to transport injured soldiers from Galgudud region,"" he was quoted as saying. The helicopter was heading to Wisil town near the frontlines of an offensive against al-Shabab by government forces when it landed. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) posted on social media on Wednesday night that the aircraft was ""not a WFP or UN Humanitarian Air Service craft and no WFP personnel were aboard"".

South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations's top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994.

It marks the fall from grace of one of Liberia's most famous judges and politicians, who prided herself as a champion of women rights. Musu-Scott, 70, is now in jail, hoping to overturn the ruling on appeal. A judge sentenced the retired judge after a jury convicted her for the murder of Charloe Musu, 29. Musu-Scott's trial heard that she - along with three other women - had ""wilfully, intentionally, purposely and maliciously inflicted several bodily injuries"" on her niece at her home last June. Musu had suffered wounds to her chest, right hand, left thigh, and left armpit after being stabbed with a sharp instrument, believed to be a knife, the indictment alleged. The former chief justice denied the charge, saying the 29-year-old had been killed by an ""assassin"" who had entered her home in the capital, Monrovia. Her arrest came as a shock to many Liberians and her trial was closely followed, especially as it came in the build-up to December's presidential election. Musu-Scott was a prominent member of President-elect Joseph Boakai's political party, and was part of its high-powered legal team which successfully challenged the election commission's refusal to allow parties to see the voters' roll. Her relatives, friends and supporters wept after Judge Roosevelt Z Willie sentenced her and the three other women, aged 80, 36 and 20, local media reported. She served as Liberia's justice minister and then as its most senior judge - the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court - until her retirement in 2003. She later entered politics, and was a lawmaker in Maryland County until 2012, according to the African Women in Law website. In 2012, she was appointed the chairperson of the Constitutional Review Committee, as Liberia tried to strengthen democracy and good governance following the authoritarian rule and conflicts of the past. Her lawyer Augustine Fayiah told the BBC he would appeal against her conviction and sentencing within the coming days. The appeal would list the ""errors"" of the judge, and show that jurors did not acting independently, he said. ""Their decisions were tempered with by justice ministry officials,"" the lawyer alleged. After the jury's verdict last month, a prosecuting lawyer was quoted as saying that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and he believed it had given the right verdict.

Warning: Contains details some readers may find distressing ""My dad had fear, constant fear. He was very afraid that someone would speak up,"" says one of the pastor's daughters, Ajoke - one of the first whistle-blowers to reach out to the BBC about the abuse she witnessed at her father's church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan). TB Joshua, who died in 2021 at the age of 57, is accused of widespread abuse and torture spanning almost 20 years. Now aged 27, Ajoke lives in hiding and has dropped her surname ""Joshua"" - the BBC is not publishing her new name. Little is known about Ajoke's birth mother, who was believed to be one of TB Joshua's congregants. Ajoke says she was raised by Evelyn, Joshua's widow, from as early as she can remember. Until the age of seven, Ajoke says she had a very happy childhood, going on holiday with the Joshua family to places like Dubai. But one day everything changed. She was suspended from school for a misdemeanour, and a local journalist wrote an article referring to her as the illegitimate child of TB Joshua. She was pulled out of school and taken to the Scoan compound in Lagos. ""I was made to move to the disciples' room. I didn't volunteer to be a disciple. I was made to join,"" she says. The disciples were an elite group of dedicated followers who served TB Joshua and lived with him inside the maze-like structure of the church. They came from all over the world, many staying at the compound for decades. They lived under a strict set of rules: forbidden to sleep for more than a few hours at a time, prohibited from using their own phones or having access to their personal emails, and forced to call TB Joshua ""Daddy"". ""The disciples were both brainwashed and enablers. Everybody was just acting based on command - like zombies. Nobody was questioning anything,"" she says. Just a child, Ajoke would not follow the rules like the other disciples: she refused to stand up when the pastor came into the room and rebelled against the severe sleeping orders. The abuse started soon after. Not long after arriving, aged seven, she remembers being beaten for wetting the bed and then being forced to walk around the compound with a sign around her neck saying ""I am a bedwetter."" ""The message about Ajoke was that she had terrible evil spirits that needed to be driven out,"" says one former female disciple. ""There was a time in the disciple meetings - he [Joshua] said people could beat her. Anyone in the female dormitory could just hit her and I remember just seeing people slapping her as they walked past,"" she says. From the moment Ajoke moved to the church in the Ikotun neighbourhood of Lagos, she was treated like an outcast. ""She was, like, kind of labelled the black sheep of the family,"" says Rae, from the UK, who spent 12 years living in the church as a disciple. Like most of the former disciples interviewed by the BBC, she opted to only use her first name. Rae remembers a time when Ajoke slept for too long, and Joshua shouted at her to get up. Another disciple took her to the shower and ""whipped her with an electrical cord and then turned the hot water on"", she says. Recalling the incident, Ajoke says: ""I was screaming at the top of my voice, and they just let the water run on my head for a very long time."" Such abuse was never-ending, she says. ""We're talking about years and years of abuse. Consistent abuse. My existence as a child from another mother undermined everything he [TB Joshua] claimed to stand for."" The abuse escalated to a different scale when she was aged 17 and confronted her dad about ""accounts, first hand, of people who had experienced sexual abuse"". ""I saw female disciples go up to his room. They were going away for hours. I was hearing things: 'Oh this happened to me. He tried sleeping with me.' Too many people were saying the same thing,"" she says. The BBC spoke to more than 25 former disciples - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - who gave powerful corroborating testimony of experiencing or witnessing sexual abuse. ""I couldn't take it any more. I walked directly into his office on that very day. I shouted at the top of my voice: 'Why are you doing this? Why are you hurting all these women?' ""I had lost every iota of fear for this man. He tried to stare me down, but I was looking in his eyes,"" she says. Emmanuel, who was part of the church for 21 years and spent more than a decade living in the compound as a disciple, remembers that day clearly. ""He [TB Joshua] was the first person that started hitting her… then other people joined,"" he says. ""He was saying: 'Can you imagine what she's saying about me?' Even as much as they were hitting her, beating her, she was still saying the same thing.""

Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel World of Secrets - The Disciples: A nine-episode season - a shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse. Listen now on BBC Sounds Ajoke says she was dragged out of his office and put in a room away from the rest of the church members, where she lived in social confinement for more than a year. It is a form of punishment within Scoan known as ""adaba"", something Rae also experienced for two years. During this time Ajoke says she was repeatedly hit with belts and chains, often on a daily basis. ""I wonder how I lived through those times. I couldn't even stand up for days after these beatings. I couldn't even take a shower. He was trying so hard to stop people listening to me."" One day when Ajoke was 19, she says she was escorted to the front gates of the church and left there. The church security, who were armed, were told she was never to be allowed back in. This was six years before her father died. ""I found myself homeless. I had nobody to reach out to. Nobody would believe me. Nothing prepared me for that life,"" she says. As a young woman with no money, Ajoke did what she could to survive and spent many years on the streets. She first contacted the BBC in 2019 after watching a BBC Africa Eye exposé - but it wasn't until others corroborated her story that a long BBC investigation began into uncovering the abuse at Scoan. The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in this investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" it said. With the help of former disciples and some close friends, Ajoke recently managed to get off the streets. But it has led to episodes where she has struggled with her mental health. Yet after everything she has been through, she has remained determined to tell the truth about her father. ""Every time I was beaten up, every time I was humiliated, it just reminded me there was something wrong in the system,"" she says. Former disciples have told the BBC that seeing Ajoke stand up to this man was one of the main reasons they started to doubt their faith in TB Joshua. ""He kept all of us in slavery, total absolute slavery,"" says Emmanuel. ""Ajoke was bold enough to confront him. I see her as a hero."" Truth, Ajoke says, is the most important thing to her: ""I lost everything, my home, my family, but for me, it comes down to the truth. ""And for as long as there's breath in me, I will defend that, until the very end."" Her dreams are to one day go back to school and finish her education that was cut so short.

The money and gifts, typically routed via outside business consultants, were intended to help win business in South Africa, Indonesia and elsewhere, according to US officials. The schemes allegedly operated from at least December 2014 until January 2022. SAP said it had cooperated with investigators and overhauled policies. ""SAP remains vigilant in maintaining the highest standards of ethics and compliance,"" the company said in a statement. SAP, which is headquartered in Germany and has shares listed in the US, is among the world's largest software companies. According to US court documents, subsidiaries of the firm in operating in five countries in Africa, Azerbaijan and Indonesia engaged in bribery schemes, ""repeatedly"" breaking company policies that were intended to guard against corruption. In South Africa, it allegedly paid millions in fees to consultants, despite no work being performed, and funded trips to New York for government officials, including golf outings. In Indonesia, it also funded shopping excursions and dining, as well as making more explicit payments. The Securities and Exchange Commission order cites WhatsApp discussions including the instructions: ""Seventy million, in fifty thousand bills…Bring empty envelope"". Officials said SAP - which was punished for violating US laws against bribery and corruption in Panama in 2016 - had failed to institute processes to address the high risk of such issues, inaccurately recording the bribes as legitimate business expenses. The settlement includes a $118.8m criminal fine, according to the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, which worked with authorities in South Africa on the investigation and announced the deal. Penalties were reduced from the maximum possible after SAP cooperated with investigators and moved to punish and fire employees involved in the payments. ""SAP has accepted responsibility for corrupt practices that hurt honest businesses engaging in global commerce,"" said US Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. ""We will continue to vigorously prosecute bribery cases to protect domestic companies that follow the law while participating in the international marketplace."" The US said it would drop the criminal charges against the firm after three years if SAP complies with the announced agreement.","['United States', 'South Africa', 'Corruption', 'Companies']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F63D/production/_132273036_gettyimages-1233993359.jpg'],,World,Africa

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-10,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations's top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. But last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South African Jewish leaders his government ""stands with the people of Palestine, who have endured over seven decades of apartheid-type… brutal occupation"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67930783,Rishi Sunak facing major Tory revolt over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.,2024-01-10,"Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Over 30 backbenchers on the right of the party are backing plans to change the bill next week to make it harder for people to appeal deportation. The amendments underline the scale of Tory division over the policy, which the PM has made a priority. Ministers insist the bill allows only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. Those backing the amendments include former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and a clutch of former cabinet ministers, including former home secretary Suella Braverman. Ex-migration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the draft law last month and is a leading rebel, said the current bill would fail to prevent a ""merry-go-round"" of individual appeals. The Rwanda policy dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer arguing the prime minister had been ""taken hostage by his own party"". He added that reports over the weekend that he had doubts about the policy when he was chancellor showed Mr Sunak had been ""caught red handed"". ""He knows the Rwanda gimmick won't work - but he can't be honest about it because he's too scared of his own MPs,"" he added. In reply, the prime minister said the government would deliver on its promise to halt migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. Mr Sunak said Labour had not put forward a ""single practical idea"" to reduce illegal migration, and ""can never be trusted to stop the boats"". The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds. Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights. The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended. A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful. However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"". He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum. He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly. Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably. Ministers could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament. And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law. The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda. ""We need a bill with a respectable legal argument and one which does not collapse the scheme,"" they added.","['Robert Jenrick', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Rwanda']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/21F6/production/_131849680_71e87bb3-11d8-4f40-bd0f-8abcc9f442e0.jpg'],"['By Paul Seddon & Sam Francis', 'Politics reporters']",World,Africa

Warning: Contains details some readers may find distressing ""My dad had fear, constant fear. He was very afraid that someone would speak up,"" says one of the pastor's daughters, Ajoke - one of the first whistle-blowers to reach out to the BBC about the abuse she witnessed at her father's church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan). TB Joshua, who died in 2021 at the age of 57, is accused of widespread abuse and torture spanning almost 20 years. Now aged 27, Ajoke lives in hiding and has dropped her surname ""Joshua"" - the BBC is not publishing her new name. Little is known about Ajoke's birth mother, who was believed to be one of TB Joshua's congregants. Ajoke says she was raised by Evelyn, Joshua's widow, from as early as she can remember. Until the age of seven, Ajoke says she had a very happy childhood, going on holiday with the Joshua family to places like Dubai. But one day everything changed. She was suspended from school for a misdemeanour, and a local journalist wrote an article referring to her as the illegitimate child of TB Joshua. She was pulled out of school and taken to the Scoan compound in Lagos. ""I was made to move to the disciples' room. I didn't volunteer to be a disciple. I was made to join,"" she says. The disciples were an elite group of dedicated followers who served TB Joshua and lived with him inside the maze-like structure of the church. They came from all over the world, many staying at the compound for decades. They lived under a strict set of rules: forbidden to sleep for more than a few hours at a time, prohibited from using their own phones or having access to their personal emails, and forced to call TB Joshua ""Daddy"". ""The disciples were both brainwashed and enablers. Everybody was just acting based on command - like zombies. Nobody was questioning anything,"" she says. Just a child, Ajoke would not follow the rules like the other disciples: she refused to stand up when the pastor came into the room and rebelled against the severe sleeping orders. The abuse started soon after. Not long after arriving, aged seven, she remembers being beaten for wetting the bed and then being forced to walk around the compound with a sign around her neck saying ""I am a bedwetter."" ""The message about Ajoke was that she had terrible evil spirits that needed to be driven out,"" says one former female disciple. ""There was a time in the disciple meetings - he [Joshua] said people could beat her. Anyone in the female dormitory could just hit her and I remember just seeing people slapping her as they walked past,"" she says. From the moment Ajoke moved to the church in the Ikotun neighbourhood of Lagos, she was treated like an outcast. ""She was, like, kind of labelled the black sheep of the family,"" says Rae, from the UK, who spent 12 years living in the church as a disciple. Like most of the former disciples interviewed by the BBC, she opted to only use her first name. Rae remembers a time when Ajoke slept for too long, and Joshua shouted at her to get up. Another disciple took her to the shower and ""whipped her with an electrical cord and then turned the hot water on"", she says. Recalling the incident, Ajoke says: ""I was screaming at the top of my voice, and they just let the water run on my head for a very long time."" Such abuse was never-ending, she says. ""We're talking about years and years of abuse. Consistent abuse. My existence as a child from another mother undermined everything he [TB Joshua] claimed to stand for."" The abuse escalated to a different scale when she was aged 17 and confronted her dad about ""accounts, first hand, of people who had experienced sexual abuse"". ""I saw female disciples go up to his room. They were going away for hours. I was hearing things: 'Oh this happened to me. He tried sleeping with me.' Too many people were saying the same thing,"" she says. The BBC spoke to more than 25 former disciples - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - who gave powerful corroborating testimony of experiencing or witnessing sexual abuse. ""I couldn't take it any more. I walked directly into his office on that very day. I shouted at the top of my voice: 'Why are you doing this? Why are you hurting all these women?' ""I had lost every iota of fear for this man. He tried to stare me down, but I was looking in his eyes,"" she says. Emmanuel, who was part of the church for 21 years and spent more than a decade living in the compound as a disciple, remembers that day clearly. ""He [TB Joshua] was the first person that started hitting her… then other people joined,"" he says. ""He was saying: 'Can you imagine what she's saying about me?' Even as much as they were hitting her, beating her, she was still saying the same thing.""

Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel World of Secrets - The Disciples: A nine-episode season - a shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse. Listen now on BBC Sounds Ajoke says she was dragged out of his office and put in a room away from the rest of the church members, where she lived in social confinement for more than a year. It is a form of punishment within Scoan known as ""adaba"", something Rae also experienced for two years. During this time Ajoke says she was repeatedly hit with belts and chains, often on a daily basis. ""I wonder how I lived through those times. I couldn't even stand up for days after these beatings. I couldn't even take a shower. He was trying so hard to stop people listening to me."" One day when Ajoke was 19, she says she was escorted to the front gates of the church and left there. The church security, who were armed, were told she was never to be allowed back in. This was six years before her father died. ""I found myself homeless. I had nobody to reach out to. Nobody would believe me. Nothing prepared me for that life,"" she says. As a young woman with no money, Ajoke did what she could to survive and spent many years on the streets. She first contacted the BBC in 2019 after watching a BBC Africa Eye exposé - but it wasn't until others corroborated her story that a long BBC investigation began into uncovering the abuse at Scoan. The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in this investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" it said. With the help of former disciples and some close friends, Ajoke recently managed to get off the streets. But it has led to episodes where she has struggled with her mental health. Yet after everything she has been through, she has remained determined to tell the truth about her father. ""Every time I was beaten up, every time I was humiliated, it just reminded me there was something wrong in the system,"" she says. Former disciples have told the BBC that seeing Ajoke stand up to this man was one of the main reasons they started to doubt their faith in TB Joshua. ""He kept all of us in slavery, total absolute slavery,"" says Emmanuel. ""Ajoke was bold enough to confront him. I see her as a hero."" Truth, Ajoke says, is the most important thing to her: ""I lost everything, my home, my family, but for me, it comes down to the truth. ""And for as long as there's breath in me, I will defend that, until the very end."" Her dreams are to one day go back to school and finish her education that was cut so short.

Her team says it will send the evidence to Guinness World Records (GWR) for official confirmation that she has broken the record. GWR responded to Ms Abdul-Razak's feat on X, formerly known as Twitter by saying: ""We look forward to reviewing her evidence!"" The current holder of the record is Irishman Alan Fisher who cooked for 119 hours and 57 minutes. Ms Abdul Razak said that she wanted to ensure that anyone who tried to break her record after her would find it very ""difficult"". Politicians, including Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia, numerous celebrities and even the Ghanaian military have expressed their support for the chef throughout the cook-a-thon.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-10,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations's top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. But last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South African Jewish leaders his government ""stands with the people of Palestine, who have endured over seven decades of apartheid-type… brutal occupation"".

Wrapped in her country's flag, Ms Abdul-Razak brought the cook-a-thon to an emotional end with a salute to the crowd on Wednesday. Prior to the cooking marathon, she called it a ""national assignment"", saying that she was doing it for Ghana. People cheered as she walked out of the hotel kitchen, in the city of Tamale. Her team says it will send the evidence to Guinness World Records (GWR) for official confirmation that she has broken the record. GWR responded to Ms Abdul-Razak's feat on X, formerly known as Twitter by saying: ""We look forward to reviewing her evidence!"" The current holder of the record is Irishman Alan Fisher who cooked for 119 hours and 57 minutes. Ms Abdul Razak said that she wanted to ensure that anyone who tried to break her record after her would find it very ""difficult"". Politicians, including Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia, numerous celebrities and even the Ghanaian military have expressed their support for the chef throughout the cook-a-thon. Last year, Hilda Baci caused huge excitement in Nigeria when she broke the record before she was surpassed by Mr Fisher.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67934605,Gloria Maya Musu-Scott: Liberia's ex-chief justice sentenced to life for murder,Liberia's former chief justice and justice minister Gloria Maya Musu-Scott has been sentenced to life in prison for the brutal murder of her niece.,2024-01-10,"Liberia's former chief justice and justice minister Gloria Maya Musu-Scott has been sentenced to life in prison for the brutal murder of her niece. It marks the fall from grace of one of Liberia's most famous judges and politicians, who prided herself as a champion of women rights. Musu-Scott, 70, is now in jail, hoping to overturn the ruling on appeal. A judge sentenced the retired judge after a jury convicted her for the murder of Charloe Musu, 29. Musu-Scott's trial heard that she - along with three other women - had ""wilfully, intentionally, purposely and maliciously inflicted several bodily injuries"" on her niece at her home last June. Musu had suffered wounds to her chest, right hand, left thigh, and left armpit after being stabbed with a sharp instrument, believed to be a knife, the indictment alleged. The former chief justice denied the charge, saying the 29-year-old had been killed by an ""assassin"" who had entered her home in the capital, Monrovia. Her arrest came as a shock to many Liberians and her trial was closely followed, especially as it came in the build-up to December's presidential election. Musu-Scott was a prominent member of President-elect Joseph Boakai's political party, and was part of its high-powered legal team which successfully challenged the election commission's refusal to allow parties to see the voters' roll. Her relatives, friends and supporters wept after Judge Roosevelt Z Willie sentenced her and the three other women, aged 80, 36 and 20, local media reported. She served as Liberia's justice minister and then as its most senior judge - the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court - until her retirement in 2003. She later entered politics, and was a lawmaker in Maryland County until 2012, according to the African Women in Law website. In 2012, she was appointed the chairperson of the Constitutional Review Committee, as Liberia tried to strengthen democracy and good governance following the authoritarian rule and conflicts of the past. Her lawyer Augustine Fayiah told the BBC he would appeal against her conviction and sentencing within the coming days. The appeal would list the ""errors"" of the judge, and show that jurors did not acting independently, he said. ""Their decisions were tempered with by justice ministry officials,"" the lawyer alleged. After the jury's verdict last month, a prosecuting lawyer was quoted as saying that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and he believed it had given the right verdict. Mr Boakai is due to be sworn in as president on 22 January after he defeated George Weah.",['Liberia'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/108AC/production/_132265776_c8ce206b9172680ace30aeb6a6918f747c7df2441457_577_1204_6781000x563.jpg'],"['By Moses Kollie Garzeawu', 'BBC News, Monrovia']",World,Africa

Warning: Contains details some readers may find distressing ""My dad had fear, constant fear. He was very afraid that someone would speak up,"" says one of the pastor's daughters, Ajoke - one of the first whistle-blowers to reach out to the BBC about the abuse she witnessed at her father's church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan). TB Joshua, who died in 2021 at the age of 57, is accused of widespread abuse and torture spanning almost 20 years. Now aged 27, Ajoke lives in hiding and has dropped her surname ""Joshua"" - the BBC is not publishing her new name. Little is known about Ajoke's birth mother, who was believed to be one of TB Joshua's congregants. Ajoke says she was raised by Evelyn, Joshua's widow, from as early as she can remember. Until the age of seven, Ajoke says she had a very happy childhood, going on holiday with the Joshua family to places like Dubai. But one day everything changed. She was suspended from school for a misdemeanour, and a local journalist wrote an article referring to her as the illegitimate child of TB Joshua. She was pulled out of school and taken to the Scoan compound in Lagos. ""I was made to move to the disciples' room. I didn't volunteer to be a disciple. I was made to join,"" she says. The disciples were an elite group of dedicated followers who served TB Joshua and lived with him inside the maze-like structure of the church. They came from all over the world, many staying at the compound for decades. They lived under a strict set of rules: forbidden to sleep for more than a few hours at a time, prohibited from using their own phones or having access to their personal emails, and forced to call TB Joshua ""Daddy"". ""The disciples were both brainwashed and enablers. Everybody was just acting based on command - like zombies. Nobody was questioning anything,"" she says. Just a child, Ajoke would not follow the rules like the other disciples: she refused to stand up when the pastor came into the room and rebelled against the severe sleeping orders. The abuse started soon after. Not long after arriving, aged seven, she remembers being beaten for wetting the bed and then being forced to walk around the compound with a sign around her neck saying ""I am a bedwetter."" ""The message about Ajoke was that she had terrible evil spirits that needed to be driven out,"" says one former female disciple. ""There was a time in the disciple meetings - he [Joshua] said people could beat her. Anyone in the female dormitory could just hit her and I remember just seeing people slapping her as they walked past,"" she says. From the moment Ajoke moved to the church in the Ikotun neighbourhood of Lagos, she was treated like an outcast. ""She was, like, kind of labelled the black sheep of the family,"" says Rae, from the UK, who spent 12 years living in the church as a disciple. Like most of the former disciples interviewed by the BBC, she opted to only use her first name. Rae remembers a time when Ajoke slept for too long, and Joshua shouted at her to get up. Another disciple took her to the shower and ""whipped her with an electrical cord and then turned the hot water on"", she says. Recalling the incident, Ajoke says: ""I was screaming at the top of my voice, and they just let the water run on my head for a very long time."" Such abuse was never-ending, she says. ""We're talking about years and years of abuse. Consistent abuse. My existence as a child from another mother undermined everything he [TB Joshua] claimed to stand for."" The abuse escalated to a different scale when she was aged 17 and confronted her dad about ""accounts, first hand, of people who had experienced sexual abuse"". ""I saw female disciples go up to his room. They were going away for hours. I was hearing things: 'Oh this happened to me. He tried sleeping with me.' Too many people were saying the same thing,"" she says. The BBC spoke to more than 25 former disciples - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - who gave powerful corroborating testimony of experiencing or witnessing sexual abuse. ""I couldn't take it any more. I walked directly into his office on that very day. I shouted at the top of my voice: 'Why are you doing this? Why are you hurting all these women?'

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-10,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations's top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. But last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South African Jewish leaders his government ""stands with the people of Palestine, who have endured over seven decades of apartheid-type… brutal occupation"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-10,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations's top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. But last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South African Jewish leaders his government ""stands with the people of Palestine, who have endured over seven decades of apartheid-type… brutal occupation"".

It marks the fall from grace of one of Liberia's most famous judges and politicians, who prided herself as a champion of women rights. Musu-Scott, 70, is now in jail, hoping to overturn the ruling on appeal. A judge sentenced the retired judge after a jury convicted her for the murder of Charloe Musu, 29. Musu-Scott's trial heard that she - along with three other women - had ""wilfully, intentionally, purposely and maliciously inflicted several bodily injuries"" on her niece at her home last June. Musu had suffered wounds to her chest, right hand, left thigh, and left armpit after being stabbed with a sharp instrument, believed to be a knife, the indictment alleged. The former chief justice denied the charge, saying the 29-year-old had been killed by an ""assassin"" who had entered her home in the capital, Monrovia. Her arrest came as a shock to many Liberians and her trial was closely followed, especially as it came in the build-up to December's presidential election. Musu-Scott was a prominent member of President-elect Joseph Boakai's political party, and was part of its high-powered legal team which successfully challenged the election commission's refusal to allow parties to see the voters' roll. Her relatives, friends and supporters wept after Judge Roosevelt Z Willie sentenced her and the three other women, aged 80, 36 and 20, local media reported. She served as Liberia's justice minister and then as its most senior judge - the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court - until her retirement in 2003. She later entered politics, and was a lawmaker in Maryland County until 2012, according to the African Women in Law website. In 2012, she was appointed the chairperson of the Constitutional Review Committee, as Liberia tried to strengthen democracy and good governance following the authoritarian rule and conflicts of the past. Her lawyer Augustine Fayiah told the BBC he would appeal against her conviction and sentencing within the coming days. The appeal would list the ""errors"" of the judge, and show that jurors did not acting independently, he said. ""Their decisions were tempered with by justice ministry officials,"" the lawyer alleged. After the jury's verdict last month, a prosecuting lawyer was quoted as saying that there was overwhelming evidence against the accused and he believed it had given the right verdict.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67920287,The Taiwan that China wants is vanishing,There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan.,2024-01-10,"There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan. It's a far rarer sight now as more and more of those likenesses, which once exceeded 40,000, are removed. Some 200-odd statues have been stashed away in a riverside park south of the capital Taipei. Here, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is standing, sitting, in marshal's uniform, in scholars' robes, astride a stallion, surrounded by adoring children, and in his dotage leaning on a walking stick. A democratic Taiwan no longer seems to have room for its erstwhile ruler. The island's burgeoning identity is once again being tested as Taiwan votes in a new government on Saturday. And with each election, China is more troubled by the assertion of a Taiwanese identity - one that thwarts the chances of what it calls  ""peaceful reunification"" with the mainland. Chiang fled China in 1949, escaping impending defeat in the civil war at the hands of Mao Zedong's communist forces. He came to Taiwan, which became the Republic of China and remains so to this day. The mainland, ruled by Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, became the People's Republic of China. Both claimed the other's territory. Neither Chiang, nor Mao, conceived of Taiwan as a separate place with a separate people. But that is what it has become. Unlike Taiwan, China's claims never waned. But almost everything else has changed on either side of the 100-mile strait. China has become richer, stronger and an unmistakable threat. Taiwan has become a democracy and is in the middle of yet another election where its ties with Beijing are being tested. No matter the result of Saturday's vote, its freedom is a danger to the Chinese Communist Party's hopes of unification. There are still those who see themselves, like Chiang, as Chinese - they look to China with admiration and even longing. On the other side are those who feel deeply Taiwanese. They see Beijing as yet another colonising foreign power, like Chiang and the Japanese before him. There are also 600,000 or so indigenous peoples who trace their ancestry back thousands of years. And then there is a younger, ambivalent generation that is wary of questions about identity. They feel Taiwanese but see no need for Taiwan to declare independence. They want peace with China, they want to do business with it but they have no desire to ever be part of it. ""I am Taiwanese. But I believe in the Republic of China,"" says a woman in her 50s, wrapped in tinsel and Christmas lights, much like Elton John. This is an uncommon response at an election rally for the Kuomintang or KMT, the party Chiang led until his death in 1975. And this is their heartland -  Taoyuan County - where tens of thousands have turned out to see their presidential candidate, Ho You-ih. The KMT is proposing peace and dialogue with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its old nemesis. Taiwan, it says, can prosper only when it talks to Beijing. ""We should be friends with the mainland,"" the woman says, laughing. ""We can make money together!"" Her name is impossible to hear over the deafening sound of patriotic rock. There is a huge roar of approval as Chiang Wan-an, the great-grandson of Chiang Kai-shek and a rising star in the KMT, comes on to the stage. ""I like him very much, he's very handsome,"" says the woman in the tinsel. ""I hope he will be president one day!"" The crowd is overwhelmingly those in their 50s or 60s, traditional KMT supporters with family or business ties to the mainland. ""I am Chinese. Taiwan is just a small island. Look at China!"" says one man in his 50s, excited about China's recent spate of space launches. ""Of course we should reunify - not now maybe, but one day we must reunify."" There are few young people in the crowd - those who are don't seem to be drawn to the KMT's legacy. ""I'm not voting for the party, I'm voting for the candidate,"" says Lin Chen-ze. ""I am Taiwanese, but I want peace. The [ruling] Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for eight years, it's time for a change, and Hou Yu-ih is a good man. He is honest and efficient."" The answers to a decades-old question - Do you see yourself as Chinese or Taiwanese? - are getting mixed up. For Beijing that is alarming. For Taiwan's political parties, it is a delicate, new dance, where ideological certainties are being quietly shelved. ""It's not right what they've done to these statues,"" says Fan Hsun-chung, a sprightly 94-year-old veteran, as he walks through the park full of Chiang's statues. Fan was 18 in 1947 when he left his home in Sichuan, deep in the mountains of southwest China, to join Chiang's army. In early 1949, as the Chinese civil war turned dramatically against them, Fan's unit was shipped to Taiwan to prepare for its use as a bastion. Six months later Chiang, his government and a defeated army of close to a million men followed. Fan thought he would return home soon. But after Mao took power, he couldn't go home, or even write home. ""So, I waited and waited, for decades."" He didn't see his hometown - far up a tributary of the mighty Yangtze river - until 1990. By then his family was long dead, many of them persecuted by the Communist Party for his actions as a ""counter-revolutionary"". His mother and older brother, he learned, had starved to death during Mao's industrialisation drive, which had triggered a famine. Despite his seven decades in Taiwan, Fan says he never stopped feeling Chinese: ""When we came here our country did not perish: we are still the Republic of China. Taiwan is a province, one of the smallest of more than 30 provinces."" Not far from here is where Chiang himself lies in unquiet rest: inside a black marble sarcophagus, still unburied nearly half a century after his death. ""We were fighting for the unification of China,"" Fan says. ""We wanted China to be strong, unified and independent. That was our dream."" For Chiang, Taiwan was only a stronghold from which to lick his wounds and pursue dreams of reconquering China. The man and his dream may be long dead, but his imprint is obvious. Walk the streets of Taipei and you are surrounded by names from a bygone era in China: Nanjing East Road, Bei-ping North Road, Chang-an West Road. The language used for education and commerce is Mandarin, a dialect from northern China. Taipei is a city of wheat noodles and dumplings, again northern fare. There are also plenty of excellent Shanghainese restaurants: a legacy of the exodus of much of that city's business elite as the communists took power. But Chiang's legacy came at a huge cost. Any expressions of Taiwanese political identity were ruthlessly crushed. Many thousands were tortured, imprisoned and executed under Chiang, whose personality cult rivalled that of Mao, Stalin or Kim Il Sung. The period entered the history books as the White Terror. The KMT and the CCP are ""like identical twins with the same mindset"", says 86-year-old John Chen, a political activist.  ""They both have this idea that we are all part of Greater China."" Chen is walking through the cell block of an old military detention centre on the south side of Taipei - a place he knows all too well. In 1969, a military court tried and jailed him here. He had been married three weeks. He spent the next 10 years in Jing Mei, one of Taipei's most feared prisons. His crime: taking part in a pro-Taiwan independence group while in medical school in Japan. He shared the cramped cell with six other inmates. They had no bunks, only a squat toilet in the corner and a tap and a bucket to wash. They sweltered in the summer and froze in the winter. They were allowed out for exercise for just 15 minutes a day. Chen, who was born under Japanese rule, speaks fluent Japanese, and admits to feeling more affinity with the ways of Japan than with those of mainland China. ""I don't consider myself Chinese. I am Taiwanese,"" he says. Chen is among the many millions - the majority of the island - whose families emigrated from China. They largely came from Fujian in several waves starting in the early 1600s. They speak Taiwanese, a version of southern Fujian dialect, as different from Mandarin as English is from Portuguese. To him, ""Taiwan is already independent"" and the future is bright. ""One day the Chinese Communist Party will collapse. And when it does, we can fully join the international community."" He dismisses Beijing's claims that Taiwan is part of China because they share a common culture and language. ""Where does that leave Tibet or Xinjiang? And if the Chinese nation is built on being Chinese or speaking Chinese, what about Singapore?"" The era of military rule is long over, and monuments across Taiwan commemorate the White Terror. But Beijing's persistent claims, some argue, are making a bristling, younger generation rethink how they see themselves. Lōa Ēng-hôa began learning Taiwanese about five years ago. Now he only speaks in Taiwanese, or English, but refuses to speak in Mandarin. To him it is the language of a colonial oppressor. He likens it to British people being forced to speak Italian because England was once part of the Roman Empire. ""When I was at elementary school, we would gather each morning and sing the [Republic of China] national anthem. And there were always some lazy students who didn't bother singing, and I would shout at them 'don't you love your country!' I really thought I was Chinese."" He says it was only when he went to work in Australia and saw how it was dealing with its turbulent history, that he began to awaken to his identity. Under KMT rule, school children were forbidden from speaking Taiwanese and punished if they did. Taiwanese parents made their children speak Mandarin, even at home, believing that it would help them get into university or find a good job. Lōa says Taiwanese may not be banned but the ""ideological dominance"" of Mandarin persists. ""And the most important thing is that we are still denied the right to be educated in Taiwanese - 80% of people are ethnically Taiwanese, but we don't have the right to be educated in our own language. How ridiculous is that?"" For young people like him, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which once called for Taiwanese independence and whose success grew out of anti-Beijing sentiment, is not going far enough. The DPP was once a ragtag outfit that struggled to win local elections and parliamentary seats. Taiwanese was the language of its rallies. Now, it's the party of power. It has ruled for 16 years in total, including the last eight. Now its young supporters speak fluent English and are passionate about the environment and LGBTQ rights, more so than any urgent need for formal Taiwan independence. At a recent rally in Taipei, the DPP's vice-presidential candidate, Hsiao Bi-khim made her first big public address. Young and charismatic, she was a big hit with the crowd. In Beijing, she is loathed: born in Japan to an American mother and Taiwanese father, Hsiao's most recent job was as Taiwan's de-facto ambassador to the United States. China's state media has been busy spreading rumours that she can barely speak Mandarin, which is untrue. But China fears the rise of politicians like Hsiao, who have almost no family ties to the mainland, and see Taiwan as closer to Tokyo and Washington than Beijing. Beyond the DPP, this is the first election where all three presidential candidates are of Taiwanese descent. None are from families that came to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949. The KMT's Hou is the son of a market trader from southern Taiwan who climbed through the ranks of the police force to head the national investigation bureau. Today, the DPP no longer talks about the need for formal independence and the KMT speaks of dialogue with Beijing, but sidesteps the subject of unification, or whether Taiwan is part of China. Both are now embracing Taiwan's peculiar ""status quo""- it elects its own leaders, but it is not considered a country. At the KMT rally, the woman in tinsel summed it up bluntly: ""This is the mountain protecting us. Without the Republic of China [status], Taiwan is finished. Taiwan can't be independent. Independence means war."" This is what experts call ""strategic ambiguity"". So far it has satisfied everyone, including Beijing. But that is not how people define who they are. ""We are all Taiwanese today regardless of where our grandparents came from. We inter-marry and mix Taiwanese and Mandarin when we speak to each other,"" say a group of hikers on a trail near Taipei. When they travel abroad, they say they are from Taiwan. ""We do not want people to think we are from China."" That is a problem for Beijing - because they are deciding what they want to be. And that runs counter to the CCP's message - a unified China under the rule of the Communist Party. It's a message that has been delivered to Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols - and Hong Kong. Not everyone feels Taiwanese, or exclusively Taiwanese, but more and more young people seem to lean this way, polls suggest. Even in this new Taiwan, Chiang's family name counts. Many here say they would like to see the KMT nominate his great-grandson in 2028. And Hsiao has been touted as a contender for the DPP. Either could win, but the challenge for China is that the Taiwanese will decide. Young voters say all they care about is peace: ""I have two younger brothers and I am very worried they will end up fighting in a war with China,"" says 21-year-old Shen Lu at the KMT rally. Like their most powerful allies, few Taiwanese talk of independence because that feels impractical, even impossible.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67920287,The Taiwan that China wants is vanishing,There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan.,2024-01-10,"There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan. It's a far rarer sight now as more and more of those likenesses, which once exceeded 40,000, are removed. Some 200-odd statues have been stashed away in a riverside park south of the capital Taipei. Here, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is standing, sitting, in marshal's uniform, in scholars' robes, astride a stallion, surrounded by adoring children, and in his dotage leaning on a walking stick. A democratic Taiwan no longer seems to have room for its erstwhile ruler. The island's burgeoning identity is once again being tested as Taiwan votes in a new government on Saturday. And with each election, China is more troubled by the assertion of a Taiwanese identity - one that thwarts the chances of what it calls  ""peaceful reunification"" with the mainland. Chiang fled China in 1949, escaping impending defeat in the civil war at the hands of Mao Zedong's communist forces. He came to Taiwan, which became the Republic of China and remains so to this day. The mainland, ruled by Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, became the People's Republic of China. Both claimed the other's territory. Neither Chiang, nor Mao, conceived of Taiwan as a separate place with a separate people. But that is what it has become. Unlike Taiwan, China's claims never waned. But almost everything else has changed on either side of the 100-mile strait. China has become richer, stronger and an unmistakable threat. Taiwan has become a democracy and is in the middle of yet another election where its ties with Beijing are being tested. No matter the result of Saturday's vote, its freedom is a danger to the Chinese Communist Party's hopes of unification. There are still those who see themselves, like Chiang, as Chinese - they look to China with admiration and even longing. On the other side are those who feel deeply Taiwanese. They see Beijing as yet another colonising foreign power, like Chiang and the Japanese before him. There are also 600,000 or so indigenous peoples who trace their ancestry back thousands of years. And then there is a younger, ambivalent generation that is wary of questions about identity. They feel Taiwanese but see no need for Taiwan to declare independence. They want peace with China, they want to do business with it but they have no desire to ever be part of it. ""I am Taiwanese. But I believe in the Republic of China,"" says a woman in her 50s, wrapped in tinsel and Christmas lights, much like Elton John. This is an uncommon response at an election rally for the Kuomintang or KMT, the party Chiang led until his death in 1975. And this is their heartland -  Taoyuan County - where tens of thousands have turned out to see their presidential candidate, Ho You-ih. The KMT is proposing peace and dialogue with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its old nemesis. Taiwan, it says, can prosper only when it talks to Beijing. ""We should be friends with the mainland,"" the woman says, laughing. ""We can make money together!"" Her name is impossible to hear over the deafening sound of patriotic rock. There is a huge roar of approval as Chiang Wan-an, the great-grandson of Chiang Kai-shek and a rising star in the KMT, comes on to the stage. ""I like him very much, he's very handsome,"" says the woman in the tinsel. ""I hope he will be president one day!"" The crowd is overwhelmingly those in their 50s or 60s, traditional KMT supporters with family or business ties to the mainland. ""I am Chinese. Taiwan is just a small island. Look at China!"" says one man in his 50s, excited about China's recent spate of space launches. ""Of course we should reunify - not now maybe, but one day we must reunify."" There are few young people in the crowd - those who are don't seem to be drawn to the KMT's legacy. ""I'm not voting for the party, I'm voting for the candidate,"" says Lin Chen-ze. ""I am Taiwanese, but I want peace. The [ruling] Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for eight years, it's time for a change, and Hou Yu-ih is a good man. He is honest and efficient."" The answers to a decades-old question - Do you see yourself as Chinese or Taiwanese? - are getting mixed up. For Beijing that is alarming. For Taiwan's political parties, it is a delicate, new dance, where ideological certainties are being quietly shelved. ""It's not right what they've done to these statues,"" says Fan Hsun-chung, a sprightly 94-year-old veteran, as he walks through the park full of Chiang's statues. Fan was 18 in 1947 when he left his home in Sichuan, deep in the mountains of southwest China, to join Chiang's army. In early 1949, as the Chinese civil war turned dramatically against them, Fan's unit was shipped to Taiwan to prepare for its use as a bastion. Six months later Chiang, his government and a defeated army of close to a million men followed. Fan thought he would return home soon. But after Mao took power, he couldn't go home, or even write home. ""So, I waited and waited, for decades."" He didn't see his hometown - far up a tributary of the mighty Yangtze river - until 1990. By then his family was long dead, many of them persecuted by the Communist Party for his actions as a ""counter-revolutionary"". His mother and older brother, he learned, had starved to death during Mao's industrialisation drive, which had triggered a famine. Despite his seven decades in Taiwan, Fan says he never stopped feeling Chinese: ""When we came here our country did not perish: we are still the Republic of China. Taiwan is a province, one of the smallest of more than 30 provinces."" Not far from here is where Chiang himself lies in unquiet rest: inside a black marble sarcophagus, still unburied nearly half a century after his death. ""We were fighting for the unification of China,"" Fan says. ""We wanted China to be strong, unified and independent. That was our dream."" For Chiang, Taiwan was only a stronghold from which to lick his wounds and pursue dreams of reconquering China. The man and his dream may be long dead, but his imprint is obvious. Walk the streets of Taipei and you are surrounded by names from a bygone era in China: Nanjing East Road, Bei-ping North Road, Chang-an West Road. The language used for education and commerce is Mandarin, a dialect from northern China. Taipei is a city of wheat noodles and dumplings, again northern fare. There are also plenty of excellent Shanghainese restaurants: a legacy of the exodus of much of that city's business elite as the communists took power. But Chiang's legacy came at a huge cost. Any expressions of Taiwanese political identity were ruthlessly crushed. Many thousands were tortured, imprisoned and executed under Chiang, whose personality cult rivalled that of Mao, Stalin or Kim Il Sung. The period entered the history books as the White Terror. The KMT and the CCP are ""like identical twins with the same mindset"", says 86-year-old John Chen, a political activist.  ""They both have this idea that we are all part of Greater China."" Chen is walking through the cell block of an old military detention centre on the south side of Taipei - a place he knows all too well. In 1969, a military court tried and jailed him here. He had been married three weeks. He spent the next 10 years in Jing Mei, one of Taipei's most feared prisons. His crime: taking part in a pro-Taiwan independence group while in medical school in Japan. He shared the cramped cell with six other inmates. They had no bunks, only a squat toilet in the corner and a tap and a bucket to wash. They sweltered in the summer and froze in the winter. They were allowed out for exercise for just 15 minutes a day. Chen, who was born under Japanese rule, speaks fluent Japanese, and admits to feeling more affinity with the ways of Japan than with those of mainland China. ""I don't consider myself Chinese. I am Taiwanese,"" he says. Chen is among the many millions - the majority of the island - whose families emigrated from China. They largely came from Fujian in several waves starting in the early 1600s. They speak Taiwanese, a version of southern Fujian dialect, as different from Mandarin as English is from Portuguese. To him, ""Taiwan is already independent"" and the future is bright. ""One day the Chinese Communist Party will collapse. And when it does, we can fully join the international community."" He dismisses Beijing's claims that Taiwan is part of China because they share a common culture and language. ""Where does that leave Tibet or Xinjiang? And if the Chinese nation is built on being Chinese or speaking Chinese, what about Singapore?"" The era of military rule is long over, and monuments across Taiwan commemorate the White Terror. But Beijing's persistent claims, some argue, are making a bristling, younger generation rethink how they see themselves. Lōa Ēng-hôa began learning Taiwanese about five years ago. Now he only speaks in Taiwanese, or English, but refuses to speak in Mandarin. To him it is the language of a colonial oppressor. He likens it to British people being forced to speak Italian because England was once part of the Roman Empire. ""When I was at elementary school, we would gather each morning and sing the [Republic of China] national anthem. And there were always some lazy students who didn't bother singing, and I would shout at them 'don't you love your country!' I really thought I was Chinese."" He says it was only when he went to work in Australia and saw how it was dealing with its turbulent history, that he began to awaken to his identity. Under KMT rule, school children were forbidden from speaking Taiwanese and punished if they did. Taiwanese parents made their children speak Mandarin, even at home, believing that it would help them get into university or find a good job. Lōa says Taiwanese may not be banned but the ""ideological dominance"" of Mandarin persists. ""And the most important thing is that we are still denied the right to be educated in Taiwanese - 80% of people are ethnically Taiwanese, but we don't have the right to be educated in our own language. How ridiculous is that?"" For young people like him, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which once called for Taiwanese independence and whose success grew out of anti-Beijing sentiment, is not going far enough. The DPP was once a ragtag outfit that struggled to win local elections and parliamentary seats. Taiwanese was the language of its rallies. Now, it's the party of power. It has ruled for 16 years in total, including the last eight. Now its young supporters speak fluent English and are passionate about the environment and LGBTQ rights, more so than any urgent need for formal Taiwan independence. At a recent rally in Taipei, the DPP's vice-presidential candidate, Hsiao Bi-khim made her first big public address. Young and charismatic, she was a big hit with the crowd. In Beijing, she is loathed: born in Japan to an American mother and Taiwanese father, Hsiao's most recent job was as Taiwan's de-facto ambassador to the United States. China's state media has been busy spreading rumours that she can barely speak Mandarin, which is untrue. But China fears the rise of politicians like Hsiao, who have almost no family ties to the mainland, and see Taiwan as closer to Tokyo and Washington than Beijing. Beyond the DPP, this is the first election where all three presidential candidates are of Taiwanese descent. None are from families that came to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949. The KMT's Hou is the son of a market trader from southern Taiwan who climbed through the ranks of the police force to head the national investigation bureau. Today, the DPP no longer talks about the need for formal independence and the KMT speaks of dialogue with Beijing, but sidesteps the subject of unification, or whether Taiwan is part of China. Both are now embracing Taiwan's peculiar ""status quo""- it elects its own leaders, but it is not considered a country. At the KMT rally, the woman in tinsel summed it up bluntly: ""This is the mountain protecting us. Without the Republic of China [status], Taiwan is finished. Taiwan can't be independent. Independence means war."" This is what experts call ""strategic ambiguity"". So far it has satisfied everyone, including Beijing. But that is not how people define who they are. ""We are all Taiwanese today regardless of where our grandparents came from. We inter-marry and mix Taiwanese and Mandarin when we speak to each other,"" say a group of hikers on a trail near Taipei. When they travel abroad, they say they are from Taiwan. ""We do not want people to think we are from China."" That is a problem for Beijing - because they are deciding what they want to be. And that runs counter to the CCP's message - a unified China under the rule of the Communist Party. It's a message that has been delivered to Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols - and Hong Kong. Not everyone feels Taiwanese, or exclusively Taiwanese, but more and more young people seem to lean this way, polls suggest. Even in this new Taiwan, Chiang's family name counts. Many here say they would like to see the KMT nominate his great-grandson in 2028. And Hsiao has been touted as a contender for the DPP. Either could win, but the challenge for China is that the Taiwanese will decide. Young voters say all they care about is peace: ""I have two younger brothers and I am very worried they will end up fighting in a war with China,"" says 21-year-old Shen Lu at the KMT rally. Like their most powerful allies, few Taiwanese talk of independence because that feels impractical, even impossible. But peace has become a refrain for keeping what they have - whatever they might choose to call it. ""I am Taiwanese but the most important thing for my generation is peace,"" Shen says. ""I don't want unification. I want the situation to stay as it is now. We should keep it like this forever.""","['Communist Party of China', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BF1/production/_132256279_chiangkai-shekpark-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12665/production/_132256357_gettyimages-1910620866-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C8A5/production/_132256315_chiangkaishekgrandsononstagewithcandidate.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9DAD/production/_132256304_kmtrally-7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/154E1/production/_132256278_chiangkai-shekpark1-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/151A4/production/_132263468_fleamarket-gettyimages-1247445592.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A195/production/_132256314_speakingtousinacell.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2C65/production/_132256311_manwhowon'tspeakmansdarin116_9.jpg"", 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B2C/production/_132263472_dpprally_gettyimages-1908162463.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135A1/production/_132256297_tinsellady.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6315/production/_132256352_gettyimages-1906596689.jpg']","['By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes', 'BBC News, Taiwan']",World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67860456,All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.",2024-01-10,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique. In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant. It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180: £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more. But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam. Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman. So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others. But finding the victims has proved more tricky. ""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained. The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers. ""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me. The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate. They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived. ""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me. Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"". The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me. I ask him if he still trusts the scammers. ""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call. ""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me. I ask him if he still trusts the scammers. ""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call. ""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67920287,The Taiwan that China wants is vanishing,There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan.,2024-01-10,"There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan. It's a far rarer sight now as more and more of those likenesses, which once exceeded 40,000, are removed. Some 200-odd statues have been stashed away in a riverside park south of the capital Taipei. Here, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is standing, sitting, in marshal's uniform, in scholars' robes, astride a stallion, surrounded by adoring children, and in his dotage leaning on a walking stick. A democratic Taiwan no longer seems to have room for its erstwhile ruler. The island's burgeoning identity is once again being tested as Taiwan votes in a new government on Saturday. And with each election, China is more troubled by the assertion of a Taiwanese identity - one that thwarts the chances of what it calls  ""peaceful reunification"" with the mainland. Chiang fled China in 1949, escaping impending defeat in the civil war at the hands of Mao Zedong's communist forces. He came to Taiwan, which became the Republic of China and remains so to this day. The mainland, ruled by Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, became the People's Republic of China. Both claimed the other's territory. Neither Chiang, nor Mao, conceived of Taiwan as a separate place with a separate people. But that is what it has become. Unlike Taiwan, China's claims never waned. But almost everything else has changed on either side of the 100-mile strait. China has become richer, stronger and an unmistakable threat. Taiwan has become a democracy and is in the middle of yet another election where its ties with Beijing are being tested. No matter the result of Saturday's vote, its freedom is a danger to the Chinese Communist Party's hopes of unification. There are still those who see themselves, like Chiang, as Chinese - they look to China with admiration and even longing. On the other side are those who feel deeply Taiwanese. They see Beijing as yet another colonising foreign power, like Chiang and the Japanese before him. There are also 600,000 or so indigenous peoples who trace their ancestry back thousands of years. And then there is a younger, ambivalent generation that is wary of questions about identity. They feel Taiwanese but see no need for Taiwan to declare independence. They want peace with China, they want to do business with it but they have no desire to ever be part of it. ""I am Taiwanese. But I believe in the Republic of China,"" says a woman in her 50s, wrapped in tinsel and Christmas lights, much like Elton John. This is an uncommon response at an election rally for the Kuomintang or KMT, the party Chiang led until his death in 1975. And this is their heartland -  Taoyuan County - where tens of thousands have turned out to see their presidential candidate, Ho You-ih. The KMT is proposing peace and dialogue with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its old nemesis. Taiwan, it says, can prosper only when it talks to Beijing. ""We should be friends with the mainland,"" the woman says, laughing. ""We can make money together!"" Her name is impossible to hear over the deafening sound of patriotic rock. There is a huge roar of approval as Chiang Wan-an, the great-grandson of Chiang Kai-shek and a rising star in the KMT, comes on to the stage. ""I like him very much, he's very handsome,"" says the woman in the tinsel. ""I hope he will be president one day!"" The crowd is overwhelmingly those in their 50s or 60s, traditional KMT supporters with family or business ties to the mainland. ""I am Chinese. Taiwan is just a small island. Look at China!"" says one man in his 50s, excited about China's recent spate of space launches. ""Of course we should reunify - not now maybe, but one day we must reunify."" There are few young people in the crowd - those who are don't seem to be drawn to the KMT's legacy. ""I'm not voting for the party, I'm voting for the candidate,"" says Lin Chen-ze. ""I am Taiwanese, but I want peace. The [ruling] Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for eight years, it's time for a change, and Hou Yu-ih is a good man. He is honest and efficient."" The answers to a decades-old question - Do you see yourself as Chinese or Taiwanese? - are getting mixed up. For Beijing that is alarming. For Taiwan's political parties, it is a delicate, new dance, where ideological certainties are being quietly shelved. ""It's not right what they've done to these statues,"" says Fan Hsun-chung, a sprightly 94-year-old veteran, as he walks through the park full of Chiang's statues. Fan was 18 in 1947 when he left his home in Sichuan, deep in the mountains of southwest China, to join Chiang's army. In early 1949, as the Chinese civil war turned dramatically against them, Fan's unit was shipped to Taiwan to prepare for its use as a bastion. Six months later Chiang, his government and a defeated army of close to a million men followed. Fan thought he would return home soon. But after Mao took power, he couldn't go home, or even write home. ""So, I waited and waited, for decades."" He didn't see his hometown - far up a tributary of the mighty Yangtze river - until 1990. By then his family was long dead, many of them persecuted by the Communist Party for his actions as a ""counter-revolutionary"". His mother and older brother, he learned, had starved to death during Mao's industrialisation drive, which had triggered a famine. Despite his seven decades in Taiwan, Fan says he never stopped feeling Chinese: ""When we came here our country did not perish: we are still the Republic of China. Taiwan is a province, one of the smallest of more than 30 provinces."" Not far from here is where Chiang himself lies in unquiet rest: inside a black marble sarcophagus, still unburied nearly half a century after his death. ""We were fighting for the unification of China,"" Fan says. ""We wanted China to be strong, unified and independent. That was our dream."" For Chiang, Taiwan was only a stronghold from which to lick his wounds and pursue dreams of reconquering China. The man and his dream may be long dead, but his imprint is obvious. Walk the streets of Taipei and you are surrounded by names from a bygone era in China: Nanjing East Road, Bei-ping North Road, Chang-an West Road. The language used for education and commerce is Mandarin, a dialect from northern China. Taipei is a city of wheat noodles and dumplings, again northern fare. There are also plenty of excellent Shanghainese restaurants: a legacy of the exodus of much of that city's business elite as the communists took power. But Chiang's legacy came at a huge cost. Any expressions of Taiwanese political identity were ruthlessly crushed. Many thousands were tortured, imprisoned and executed under Chiang, whose personality cult rivalled that of Mao, Stalin or Kim Il Sung. The period entered the history books as the White Terror. The KMT and the CCP are ""like identical twins with the same mindset"", says 86-year-old John Chen, a political activist.  ""They both have this idea that we are all part of Greater China."" Chen is walking through the cell block of an old military detention centre on the south side of Taipei - a place he knows all too well. In 1969, a military court tried and jailed him here. He had been married three weeks. He spent the next 10 years in Jing Mei, one of Taipei's most feared prisons. His crime: taking part in a pro-Taiwan independence group while in medical school in Japan. He shared the cramped cell with six other inmates. They had no bunks, only a squat toilet in the corner and a tap and a bucket to wash. They sweltered in the summer and froze in the winter. They were allowed out for exercise for just 15 minutes a day. Chen, who was born under Japanese rule, speaks fluent Japanese, and admits to feeling more affinity with the ways of Japan than with those of mainland China. ""I don't consider myself Chinese. I am Taiwanese,"" he says. Chen is among the many millions - the majority of the island - whose families emigrated from China. They largely came from Fujian in several waves starting in the early 1600s. They speak Taiwanese, a version of southern Fujian dialect, as different from Mandarin as English is from Portuguese. To him, ""Taiwan is already independent"" and the future is bright. ""One day the Chinese Communist Party will collapse. And when it does, we can fully join the international community."" He dismisses Beijing's claims that Taiwan is part of China because they share a common culture and language. ""Where does that leave Tibet or Xinjiang? And if the Chinese nation is built on being Chinese or speaking Chinese, what about Singapore?"" The era of military rule is long over, and monuments across Taiwan commemorate the White Terror. But Beijing's persistent claims, some argue, are making a bristling, younger generation rethink how they see themselves. Lōa Ēng-hôa began learning Taiwanese about five years ago. Now he only speaks in Taiwanese, or English, but refuses to speak in Mandarin. To him it is the language of a colonial oppressor. He likens it to British people being forced to speak Italian because England was once part of the Roman Empire. ""When I was at elementary school, we would gather each morning and sing the [Republic of China] national anthem. And there were always some lazy students who didn't bother singing, and I would shout at them 'don't you love your country!' I really thought I was Chinese."" He says it was only when he went to work in Australia and saw how it was dealing with its turbulent history, that he began to awaken to his identity. Under KMT rule, school children were forbidden from speaking Taiwanese and punished if they did. Taiwanese parents made their children speak Mandarin, even at home, believing that it would help them get into university or find a good job. Lōa says Taiwanese may not be banned but the ""ideological dominance"" of Mandarin persists. ""And the most important thing is that we are still denied the right to be educated in Taiwanese - 80% of people are ethnically Taiwanese, but we don't have the right to be educated in our own language. How ridiculous is that?"" For young people like him, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which once called for Taiwanese independence and whose success grew out of anti-Beijing sentiment, is not going far enough. The DPP was once a ragtag outfit that struggled to win local elections and parliamentary seats. Taiwanese was the language of its rallies. Now, it's the party of power. It has ruled for 16 years in total, including the last eight. Now its young supporters speak fluent English and are passionate about the environment and LGBTQ rights, more so than any urgent need for formal Taiwan independence. At a recent rally in Taipei, the DPP's vice-presidential candidate, Hsiao Bi-khim made her first big public address. Young and charismatic, she was a big hit with the crowd. In Beijing, she is loathed: born in Japan to an American mother and Taiwanese father, Hsiao's most recent job was as Taiwan's de-facto ambassador to the United States. China's state media has been busy spreading rumours that she can barely speak Mandarin, which is untrue. But China fears the rise of politicians like Hsiao, who have almost no family ties to the mainland, and see Taiwan as closer to Tokyo and Washington than Beijing. Beyond the DPP, this is the first election where all three presidential candidates are of Taiwanese descent. None are from families that came to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949. The KMT's Hou is the son of a market trader from southern Taiwan who climbed through the ranks of the police force to head the national investigation bureau. Today, the DPP no longer talks about the need for formal independence and the KMT speaks of dialogue with Beijing, but sidesteps the subject of unification, or whether Taiwan is part of China. Both are now embracing Taiwan's peculiar ""status quo""- it elects its own leaders, but it is not considered a country. At the KMT rally, the woman in tinsel summed it up bluntly: ""This is the mountain protecting us. Without the Republic of China [status], Taiwan is finished. Taiwan can't be independent. Independence means war."" This is what experts call ""strategic ambiguity"". So far it has satisfied everyone, including Beijing. But that is not how people define who they are. ""We are all Taiwanese today regardless of where our grandparents came from. We inter-marry and mix Taiwanese and Mandarin when we speak to each other,"" say a group of hikers on a trail near Taipei. When they travel abroad, they say they are from Taiwan. ""We do not want people to think we are from China."" That is a problem for Beijing - because they are deciding what they want to be. And that runs counter to the CCP's message - a unified China under the rule of the Communist Party. It's a message that has been delivered to Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols - and Hong Kong. Not everyone feels Taiwanese, or exclusively Taiwanese, but more and more young people seem to lean this way, polls suggest. Even in this new Taiwan, Chiang's family name counts. Many here say they would like to see the KMT nominate his great-grandson in 2028. And Hsiao has been touted as a contender for the DPP. Either could win, but the challenge for China is that the Taiwanese will decide. Young voters say all they care about is peace: ""I have two younger brothers and I am very worried they will end up fighting in a war with China,"" says 21-year-old Shen Lu at the KMT rally. Like their most powerful allies, few Taiwanese talk of independence because that feels impractical, even impossible. But peace has become a refrain for keeping what they have - whatever they might choose to call it. ""I am Taiwanese but the most important thing for my generation is peace,"" Shen says. ""I don't want unification. I want the situation to stay as it is now. We should keep it like this forever.""","['Communist Party of China', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BF1/production/_132256279_chiangkai-shekpark-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12665/production/_132256357_gettyimages-1910620866-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C8A5/production/_132256315_chiangkaishekgrandsononstagewithcandidate.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9DAD/production/_132256304_kmtrally-7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/154E1/production/_132256278_chiangkai-shekpark1-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/151A4/production/_132263468_fleamarket-gettyimages-1247445592.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A195/production/_132256314_speakingtousinacell.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2C65/production/_132256311_manwhowon'tspeakmansdarin116_9.jpg"", 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B2C/production/_132263472_dpprally_gettyimages-1908162463.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135A1/production/_132256297_tinsellady.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6315/production/_132256352_gettyimages-1906596689.jpg']","['By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes', 'BBC News, Taiwan']",World,Asia

It urged the US to ""stop arming Taiwan"" and take its concerns ""seriously"". This comes just days ahead of pivotal elections in Taiwan, which could push the island further towards - or away - from Beijing. China claims Taiwan as part of its own territory, but the island sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland. ""China expressed its willingness to develop healthy and stable military-to-military relations with the United States on the basis of equality and respect,"" said the defence ministry readout. It went on to say that the US needed to take China's concerns ""seriously"",  adding that Beijing would ""not make any concession or compromise on the Taiwan question and demand that the US side honor the one-China principle, relevant commitments, stop arming Taiwan, and not support Taiwan independence"". Taiwan is a key flashpoint in the tussle between China and the US for supremacy in Asia. In 2022, China refused to resume talks as a protest move after then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022. Their resumption early this week follows a deal struck by Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden during a meeting in November. The two-day talks concluded in Washington on Tuesday. Separately, Taiwan has said it does not consider the launch of a Chinese satellite over the island's southern airspace on Tuesday an act of election interference. A satellite launch on Tuesday afternoon prompted an islandwide air raid alert. Mobile phone users across the self-ruled island received a message warning them to ""be aware for your safety"". Taiwan's defence ministry later apologised for its inaccurate reference to a missile in the alert sent to mobile phones. ""After the national security team has analysed the overall relevant information and taken into account the evaluation of the information of various international allies, political attempts can be ruled out,"" said Lin Yu-chan, a spokesman of Taiwan's presidential office. Chinese state media said the satellite, named the Einstein Probe, is used to ""observe mysterious transient phenomena"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67860456,All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.",2024-01-10,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique. In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant. It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180: £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more. But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam. Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman. So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others. But finding the victims has proved more tricky. ""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained. The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers. ""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me. The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate. They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived. ""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me. Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"". The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67920287,The Taiwan that China wants is vanishing,There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan.,2024-01-10,"There was a time when the beneficent smile of a dictator greeted you everywhere in Taiwan. It's a far rarer sight now as more and more of those likenesses, which once exceeded 40,000, are removed. Some 200-odd statues have been stashed away in a riverside park south of the capital Taipei. Here, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is standing, sitting, in marshal's uniform, in scholars' robes, astride a stallion, surrounded by adoring children, and in his dotage leaning on a walking stick. A democratic Taiwan no longer seems to have room for its erstwhile ruler. The island's burgeoning identity is once again being tested as Taiwan votes in a new government on Saturday. And with each election, China is more troubled by the assertion of a Taiwanese identity - one that thwarts the chances of what it calls  ""peaceful reunification"" with the mainland. Chiang fled China in 1949, escaping impending defeat in the civil war at the hands of Mao Zedong's communist forces. He came to Taiwan, which became the Republic of China and remains so to this day. The mainland, ruled by Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, became the People's Republic of China. Both claimed the other's territory. Neither Chiang, nor Mao, conceived of Taiwan as a separate place with a separate people. But that is what it has become. Unlike Taiwan, China's claims never waned. But almost everything else has changed on either side of the 100-mile strait. China has become richer, stronger and an unmistakable threat. Taiwan has become a democracy and is in the middle of yet another election where its ties with Beijing are being tested. No matter the result of Saturday's vote, its freedom is a danger to the Chinese Communist Party's hopes of unification. There are still those who see themselves, like Chiang, as Chinese - they look to China with admiration and even longing. On the other side are those who feel deeply Taiwanese. They see Beijing as yet another colonising foreign power, like Chiang and the Japanese before him. There are also 600,000 or so indigenous peoples who trace their ancestry back thousands of years. And then there is a younger, ambivalent generation that is wary of questions about identity. They feel Taiwanese but see no need for Taiwan to declare independence. They want peace with China, they want to do business with it but they have no desire to ever be part of it. ""I am Taiwanese. But I believe in the Republic of China,"" says a woman in her 50s, wrapped in tinsel and Christmas lights, much like Elton John. This is an uncommon response at an election rally for the Kuomintang or KMT, the party Chiang led until his death in 1975. And this is their heartland -  Taoyuan County - where tens of thousands have turned out to see their presidential candidate, Ho You-ih. The KMT is proposing peace and dialogue with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its old nemesis. Taiwan, it says, can prosper only when it talks to Beijing. ""We should be friends with the mainland,"" the woman says, laughing. ""We can make money together!"" Her name is impossible to hear over the deafening sound of patriotic rock. There is a huge roar of approval as Chiang Wan-an, the great-grandson of Chiang Kai-shek and a rising star in the KMT, comes on to the stage. ""I like him very much, he's very handsome,"" says the woman in the tinsel. ""I hope he will be president one day!"" The crowd is overwhelmingly those in their 50s or 60s, traditional KMT supporters with family or business ties to the mainland. ""I am Chinese. Taiwan is just a small island. Look at China!"" says one man in his 50s, excited about China's recent spate of space launches. ""Of course we should reunify - not now maybe, but one day we must reunify."" There are few young people in the crowd - those who are don't seem to be drawn to the KMT's legacy. ""I'm not voting for the party, I'm voting for the candidate,"" says Lin Chen-ze. ""I am Taiwanese, but I want peace. The [ruling] Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for eight years, it's time for a change, and Hou Yu-ih is a good man. He is honest and efficient."" The answers to a decades-old question - Do you see yourself as Chinese or Taiwanese? - are getting mixed up. For Beijing that is alarming. For Taiwan's political parties, it is a delicate, new dance, where ideological certainties are being quietly shelved. ""It's not right what they've done to these statues,"" says Fan Hsun-chung, a sprightly 94-year-old veteran, as he walks through the park full of Chiang's statues. Fan was 18 in 1947 when he left his home in Sichuan, deep in the mountains of southwest China, to join Chiang's army. In early 1949, as the Chinese civil war turned dramatically against them, Fan's unit was shipped to Taiwan to prepare for its use as a bastion. Six months later Chiang, his government and a defeated army of close to a million men followed. Fan thought he would return home soon. But after Mao took power, he couldn't go home, or even write home. ""So, I waited and waited, for decades."" He didn't see his hometown - far up a tributary of the mighty Yangtze river - until 1990. By then his family was long dead, many of them persecuted by the Communist Party for his actions as a ""counter-revolutionary"". His mother and older brother, he learned, had starved to death during Mao's industrialisation drive, which had triggered a famine. Despite his seven decades in Taiwan, Fan says he never stopped feeling Chinese: ""When we came here our country did not perish: we are still the Republic of China. Taiwan is a province, one of the smallest of more than 30 provinces."" Not far from here is where Chiang himself lies in unquiet rest: inside a black marble sarcophagus, still unburied nearly half a century after his death. ""We were fighting for the unification of China,"" Fan says. ""We wanted China to be strong, unified and independent. That was our dream."" For Chiang, Taiwan was only a stronghold from which to lick his wounds and pursue dreams of reconquering China. The man and his dream may be long dead, but his imprint is obvious. Walk the streets of Taipei and you are surrounded by names from a bygone era in China: Nanjing East Road, Bei-ping North Road, Chang-an West Road. The language used for education and commerce is Mandarin, a dialect from northern China. Taipei is a city of wheat noodles and dumplings, again northern fare. There are also plenty of excellent Shanghainese restaurants: a legacy of the exodus of much of that city's business elite as the communists took power. But Chiang's legacy came at a huge cost. Any expressions of Taiwanese political identity were ruthlessly crushed. Many thousands were tortured, imprisoned and executed under Chiang, whose personality cult rivalled that of Mao, Stalin or Kim Il Sung. The period entered the history books as the White Terror. The KMT and the CCP are ""like identical twins with the same mindset"", says 86-year-old John Chen, a political activist.  ""They both have this idea that we are all part of Greater China."" Chen is walking through the cell block of an old military detention centre on the south side of Taipei - a place he knows all too well. In 1969, a military court tried and jailed him here. He had been married three weeks. He spent the next 10 years in Jing Mei, one of Taipei's most feared prisons. His crime: taking part in a pro-Taiwan independence group while in medical school in Japan. He shared the cramped cell with six other inmates. They had no bunks, only a squat toilet in the corner and a tap and a bucket to wash. They sweltered in the summer and froze in the winter. They were allowed out for exercise for just 15 minutes a day. Chen, who was born under Japanese rule, speaks fluent Japanese, and admits to feeling more affinity with the ways of Japan than with those of mainland China. ""I don't consider myself Chinese. I am Taiwanese,"" he says. Chen is among the many millions - the majority of the island - whose families emigrated from China. They largely came from Fujian in several waves starting in the early 1600s. They speak Taiwanese, a version of southern Fujian dialect, as different from Mandarin as English is from Portuguese. To him, ""Taiwan is already independent"" and the future is bright. ""One day the Chinese Communist Party will collapse. And when it does, we can fully join the international community."" He dismisses Beijing's claims that Taiwan is part of China because they share a common culture and language. ""Where does that leave Tibet or Xinjiang? And if the Chinese nation is built on being Chinese or speaking Chinese, what about Singapore?"" The era of military rule is long over, and monuments across Taiwan commemorate the White Terror. But Beijing's persistent claims, some argue, are making a bristling, younger generation rethink how they see themselves. Lōa Ēng-hôa began learning Taiwanese about five years ago. Now he only speaks in Taiwanese, or English, but refuses to speak in Mandarin. To him it is the language of a colonial oppressor. He likens it to British people being forced to speak Italian because England was once part of the Roman Empire. ""When I was at elementary school, we would gather each morning and sing the [Republic of China] national anthem. And there were always some lazy students who didn't bother singing, and I would shout at them 'don't you love your country!' I really thought I was Chinese."" He says it was only when he went to work in Australia and saw how it was dealing with its turbulent history, that he began to awaken to his identity. Under KMT rule, school children were forbidden from speaking Taiwanese and punished if they did. Taiwanese parents made their children speak Mandarin, even at home, believing that it would help them get into university or find a good job. Lōa says Taiwanese may not be banned but the ""ideological dominance"" of Mandarin persists. ""And the most important thing is that we are still denied the right to be educated in Taiwanese - 80% of people are ethnically Taiwanese, but we don't have the right to be educated in our own language. How ridiculous is that?"" For young people like him, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which once called for Taiwanese independence and whose success grew out of anti-Beijing sentiment, is not going far enough. The DPP was once a ragtag outfit that struggled to win local elections and parliamentary seats. Taiwanese was the language of its rallies. Now, it's the party of power. It has ruled for 16 years in total, including the last eight. Now its young supporters speak fluent English and are passionate about the environment and LGBTQ rights, more so than any urgent need for formal Taiwan independence. At a recent rally in Taipei, the DPP's vice-presidential candidate, Hsiao Bi-khim made her first big public address. Young and charismatic, she was a big hit with the crowd. In Beijing, she is loathed: born in Japan to an American mother and Taiwanese father, Hsiao's most recent job was as Taiwan's de-facto ambassador to the United States. China's state media has been busy spreading rumours that she can barely speak Mandarin, which is untrue. But China fears the rise of politicians like Hsiao, who have almost no family ties to the mainland, and see Taiwan as closer to Tokyo and Washington than Beijing. Beyond the DPP, this is the first election where all three presidential candidates are of Taiwanese descent. None are from families that came to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949. The KMT's Hou is the son of a market trader from southern Taiwan who climbed through the ranks of the police force to head the national investigation bureau. Today, the DPP no longer talks about the need for formal independence and the KMT speaks of dialogue with Beijing, but sidesteps the subject of unification, or whether Taiwan is part of China. Both are now embracing Taiwan's peculiar ""status quo""- it elects its own leaders, but it is not considered a country. At the KMT rally, the woman in tinsel summed it up bluntly: ""This is the mountain protecting us. Without the Republic of China [status], Taiwan is finished. Taiwan can't be independent. Independence means war."" This is what experts call ""strategic ambiguity"". So far it has satisfied everyone, including Beijing. But that is not how people define who they are. ""We are all Taiwanese today regardless of where our grandparents came from. We inter-marry and mix Taiwanese and Mandarin when we speak to each other,"" say a group of hikers on a trail near Taipei. When they travel abroad, they say they are from Taiwan. ""We do not want people to think we are from China."" That is a problem for Beijing - because they are deciding what they want to be. And that runs counter to the CCP's message - a unified China under the rule of the Communist Party. It's a message that has been delivered to Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongols - and Hong Kong. Not everyone feels Taiwanese, or exclusively Taiwanese, but more and more young people seem to lean this way, polls suggest. Even in this new Taiwan, Chiang's family name counts. Many here say they would like to see the KMT nominate his great-grandson in 2028. And Hsiao has been touted as a contender for the DPP. Either could win, but the challenge for China is that the Taiwanese will decide. Young voters say all they care about is peace: ""I have two younger brothers and I am very worried they will end up fighting in a war with China,"" says 21-year-old Shen Lu at the KMT rally. Like their most powerful allies, few Taiwanese talk of independence because that feels impractical, even impossible. But peace has become a refrain for keeping what they have - whatever they might choose to call it. ""I am Taiwanese but the most important thing for my generation is peace,"" Shen says. ""I don't want unification. I want the situation to stay as it is now. We should keep it like this forever.""","['Communist Party of China', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BF1/production/_132256279_chiangkai-shekpark-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12665/production/_132256357_gettyimages-1910620866-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C8A5/production/_132256315_chiangkaishekgrandsononstagewithcandidate.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9DAD/production/_132256304_kmtrally-7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/154E1/production/_132256278_chiangkai-shekpark1-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/151A4/production/_132263468_fleamarket-gettyimages-1247445592.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A195/production/_132256314_speakingtousinacell.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2C65/production/_132256311_manwhowon'tspeakmansdarin116_9.jpg"", 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B2C/production/_132263472_dpprally_gettyimages-1908162463.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135A1/production/_132256297_tinsellady.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6315/production/_132256352_gettyimages-1906596689.jpg']","['By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes', 'BBC News, Taiwan']",World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67860456,All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.",2024-01-10,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique. In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant. It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180: £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more. But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam. Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman. So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others. But finding the victims has proved more tricky. ""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained. The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers. ""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me. The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate. They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived. ""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me. Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"". The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me. I ask him if he still trusts the scammers. ""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call. ""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67921298,Calls grow for Fujitsu to pay for Post Office injustice,"Fujitsu should be paying compensation to sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for theft, says Sally Stringer one of the victims of the Post Office scandal.",2024-01-10,"Fujitsu should be paying compensation to sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for theft, says Sally Stringer one of the victims of the Post Office scandal. She is angry the Japanese-owned company, which developed the software at the heart of the affair, is still winning government contracts 20 years after the problems first arose. Fujitsu said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. But there is a growing chorus calling for action over the firm's role. No-one from Fujitsu has been held to account for failures with Horizon, the software it supplied to the Post Office. The firm has not paid any compensation to victims and has continued to win government contracts for its IT services worth billions of pounds. The public inquiry into the scandal is still waiting to hear from Gareth Jenkins, Fujitsu's former chief IT architect. His court testimony was central to convictions of many sub-postmasters and used repeatedly by Post Office lawyers in court cases to say that the Fujitsu IT system was working correctly. Mr Jenkins has twice asked for immunity from prosecution before giving evidence, but the judge chairing the inquiry has turned down the requests. On Tuesday the prime minister announced the government would bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Ms Stringer, along with hundreds of other sub-postmasters, was accused of taking money from the till at the Post Office she ran, after Horizon indicated there was a cash shortfall. She had to pay back £50,000 out of her own pocket. Speaking on BBC television she challenged Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake over the issue. ""I believe that [Fujitsu] should be held responsible for some of the compensation... I mean Horizon is faulty,"" she said. Ms Stringer's calls for swifter action have been echoed by senior politicians including Liam Byrne, chair of parliament's Business and Trade Committee, which has asked the firm's executives to appear before it next week. ""When a firm has been heavily involved in a system that's shared information that put innocent people behind bars, then it's only rational that there is a moral obligation to contribute to compensation,"" he said. But the government has said it will not pre-empt the findings of the public inquiry into the scandal. Mr Hollinrake said the government's position was to wait for the inquiry to conclude ""and then we impose sanctions on those that are responsible, be it a prosecution, or asking people to contribute to the tax payers' bill for compensation"". He agreed that the taxpayer should not be left to ""pick up the tab for the compensation that we're paying the postmasters"" he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. Questions are also being asked over why the firm has continued to win government contracts, despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that Horizon contained ""bugs, errors and defects"" and that there was a ""material risk"" shortfalls in branch accounts were caused by the system. Over the past four years Fujitsu has won 101 contracts worth £2bn including £36m for an extension to the contract for Horizon, according to according to the procurement analysts Tussell. The government has removed Fujitsu from its list of preferred suppliers, but the firm is still able to win contracts through the normal procurement process. In fact Fujitsu's products are so deeply entrenched in the government's IT infrastructure, it may be near impossible to remove them, according to IT journalist Tony Collins, who has covered the industry for decades. ""If Fujitsu pulled the plug on the Post Office, which you wouldn't do, post offices would cease to function. Government cannot do without Fujitsu."" The firm supplies large IT systems to the tax authority, HMRC, the Department for Work and Pensions and other parts of government, Mr Collins explained. However, Fujitsu may decide to offer compensation to victims of the scandal without being required to by the government, Mr Collins suggested. ""I would imagine Fujitsu may seriously consider donating. Government hates suing big IT suppliers because it means going into an open courtroom and revealing things about government schemes that might be highly dysfunctional"" he said. As well as appearing at the parliamentary committee, Fujitsu executives will also face questioning next week at the independent public inquiry looking into the scandal. The government has indicated that the outcome of the inquiry could influence future contracts with Fujitsu. Fujitsu said it was fully committed to supporting the inquiry to learn from the events stretching back two decades.

The inquiry has been under way since 2021 but the scandal hit the headlines after ITV aired a dramatisation of the events last week. It told the story of how more than 700 branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on faulty software, over 15 years. More than 100 new potential victims of the scandal have since come forward, prompted by the programme and subsequent coverage.

It urged the US to ""stop arming Taiwan"" and take its concerns ""seriously"". This comes just days ahead of pivotal elections in Taiwan, which could push the island further towards - or away - from Beijing. China claims Taiwan as part of its own territory, but the island sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland. ""China expressed its willingness to develop healthy and stable military-to-military relations with the United States on the basis of equality and respect,"" said the defence ministry readout. It went on to say that the US needed to take China's concerns ""seriously"",  adding that Beijing would ""not make any concession or compromise on the Taiwan question and demand that the US side honor the one-China principle, relevant commitments, stop arming Taiwan, and not support Taiwan independence"". Taiwan is a key flashpoint in the tussle between China and the US for supremacy in Asia. In 2022, China refused to resume talks as a protest move after then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022. Their resumption early this week follows a deal struck by Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden during a meeting in November. The two-day talks concluded in Washington on Tuesday. Separately, Taiwan has said it does not consider the launch of a Chinese satellite over the island's southern airspace on Tuesday an act of election interference. A satellite launch on Tuesday afternoon prompted an islandwide air raid alert. Mobile phone users across the self-ruled island received a message warning them to ""be aware for your safety"". Taiwan's defence ministry later apologised for its inaccurate reference to a missile in the alert sent to mobile phones. ""After the national security team has analysed the overall relevant information and taken into account the evaluation of the information of various international allies, political attempts can be ruled out,"" said Lin Yu-chan, a spokesman of Taiwan's presidential office. Chinese state media said the satellite, named the Einstein Probe, is used to ""observe mysterious transient phenomena"". The island's main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT) criticised the ""arbitrary"" use of an islandwide alert as fear-mongering.","['Taiwan', 'China-US relations', 'United States', 'Asia']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5308/production/_132265212_cfd07dc3a818efdb442de92278036e127ba9f3e9.jpg'],"['By Kelly Ng', 'BBC News']",World,Asia

If Israel is not excluded from the competition, they want public broadcaster Yle to withdraw Finland's entry from the competition. Yle has said it is monitoring the position of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), organiser of the contest. Last month, Icelandic musicians made similar demands to broadcaster Rúv.

Signatories include Finnish artists Olavi Uusivirta, Paleface and Axel Ehnström, who represented the country in the 2011 contest. The petition accuses broadcaster Yle of double standards, saying it was among the first to demand a ban on Russia from the 2022 contest, ""and we expect the same active defending of values from Yle now as well"". A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Yle representative Ville Vilén said Moscow's attack was ""contrary to all the values that Yle and other European broadcasters represent"". The EBU soon after banned Russia from participating. Mr Vilén has said the situation in Israel and Gaza is ""not quite the same"". ""As gruesome as it is, it is not a war of inter-state aggression like between Russia and Ukraine,"" he told Finnish tabloid Ilta Sanomat a few weeks ago. Yle's head of communications Jere Nurminen told Hufvudstadsbladet the company was following the situation and talking to the EBU and other public broadcasters. Yle was also planning to meet the petition's authors, he added.

More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's military campaign - mostly women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The war was triggered after an attack by gunmen belonging to Hamas - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western governments - on southern Israel. About 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed, with about 240 others taken hostage. Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza before mounting a ground operation with the stated aim of ""destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"" as well as freeing the hostages. A total blockade of Gaza by the Israeli military has cut off supplies of food, medicines and fuel. UN agencies say 26% of Gazans - 576,600 people - have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face ""catastrophic hunger and starvation"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67935463,Austrian heiress Marlene Engelhorn announces plan for €25m giveaway,An Austro-German heiress is setting up a citizens group to decide how she should give away much of the fortune she inherited from her grandmother.,2024-01-10,"An Austro-German heiress is setting up a citizens group to decide how she should give away much of the fortune she inherited from her grandmother. Marlene Engelhorn, who is 31 and lives in Vienna, wants 50 Austrians to determine how €25m (£21.5m) of her inheritance should be redistributed. ""I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,"" she said. ""And the state doesn't even want taxes on it."" Austria abolished inheritance tax in 2008, one of a handful of European countries that do not impose inheritance tax - or death duties. Ms Engelhorn believes that is unfair. She is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, the founder of German chemical and pharmaceutical company, BASF, and inherited millions when her grandmother died in September 2022. Traudl Engelhorn-Vechiatto's wealth was estimated by US magazine Forbes at $4.2bn (£3.3bn: €3.8bn), and even before she died her grand-daughter had declared that she wanted to hand out about 90% of her inheritance. On Wednesday, 10,000 invitations targeting randomly selected Austrian citizens began arriving in letterboxes in Austria. Those who wish to take part in Ms Engelhorn's initiative, known as the Good Council for Redistribution, can register online or by phone. From that initial sample of 10,000 Austrians who are all aged over 16, 50 people will be chosen, with 15 substitute members also selected in case of dropouts. ""If politicians don't do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself,"" she explained in her statement. ""Many people struggle to make ends meet with a full-time job, and pay taxes on every euro they earn from work. I see this as a failure of politics, and if politics fails, then the citizens have to deal with it themselves."" Christoph Hofinger, Managing Director of the Foresight Institute which is supporting the initiative, said the council to redistribute the heiress's money would be made up of 50 people ""from all age groups, federal states, social classes and backgrounds"". The group will be asked to ""contribute their ideas in order to jointly develop solutions in the interests of society as a whole"", he said. They will take part in a series of meetings to be held in Salzburg with academics and civil society organisations from March to June this year. Organisers say the meetings will be barrier-free, with childcare and interpreters available if required. Travel costs will be covered and participants will receive €1,200 for every weekend they attend. Marlene Engelhorn believes their discussions will be a ""service to democracy"" and so they should be properly compensated for it. ""I have no veto rights,"" she said: ""I am putting my assets at the disposal of these 50 people and placing my trust in them."" If they cannot come up with a ""widely supported"" decision on what to do with the money, then the money goes back to Ms Engelhorn. It is not clear exactly what proportion of her inheritance is being given away, although back in 2021 she said she wanted to hand out at least 90% of it because she had done nothing to earn it and had merely struck lucky in a ""birth lottery"". Her team has not confirmed how much she is holding back although it said she was retaining some kind of financial buffer. Sixteen years after Austria abolished inheritance tax, it remains contentious, and one major political party, the opposition Social Democrats, wants it reinstated. Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler told public broadcaster ORF that he wanted it to be a central condition for potential coalition negotiations, after Austria's next general election which is due later this year. The conservative People's Party, which is currently the senior partner in Austria's coalition government with the Greens, has rejected his proposal. Its general secretary, Christian Stocker, said that while Mr Babler wanted to ""to further burden people in our country with his call for a wealth and inheritance tax, the People's Party is providing relief. We reject new taxes: people must be left with more net income.""",['Austria'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5CCC/production/_132265732_obs_20240109_obs0032.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E27/production/_124870002_0a6ee93a-57d9-41d6-ae4a-6089d9a91981.jpg']","['By Bethany Bell', 'BBC News, Vienna']",World,Europe

Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin told a defence conference ""there could be war in Sweden"". His message was then backed up by military commander-in-chief Gen Micael Byden, who said all Swedes should prepare mentally for the possibility. However, opposition politicians have objected to the tone of the warnings. Ex-prime minister Magdalena Andersson told Swedish TV that while the security situation was serious, ""it is not as if war is just outside the door."" Children's rights organisation Bris said that its national helpline did not usually receive calls about the possibility of war. But this week, it had seen an increase in worried calls from youngsters who had seen news reports or posts on TikTok talking about it. ""This was well prepared, it wasn't something blurted out,"" Bris spokeswoman Maja Dahl told the BBC. ""They should have provided information meant for kids when they come out with this kind of information for grown-ups."" Despite the starkness of the messaging, the remarks from the civil defence minister and military chief are being seen as a wake-up call. After more than two centuries of peace, Sweden is a few steps from joining the Nato defensive alliance, waiting for a green light from Turkey's parliament and then from Hungary. The commander-in-chief said his remarks were nothing new. He visited Ukraine's eastern front a month ago and Sweden is one of a group of countries training Ukrainian pilots. Stockholm is also said to be considering sending advanced Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine. ""My ambition with this is not to worry people: my ambition is to get more people to think about their own situation and their own responsibilities,"" Gen Byden later told Aftonbladet newspaper. Finland has already joined Nato, and Russian officials have suggested it will be ""the first to suffer"" if tensions with Nato escalate. Sweden's civil defence minister said his aim was not for people to lose sleep, but to gain awareness of what was really going on. He appealed to local authorities, emergency planners and individuals to respond. ""If there is one thing that keeps me awake at night, it is the feeling that things are moving too slowly,"" Mr Bohlin told the Society and Defence conference on Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Sweden during the conference to work with his country and others to manufacture weapons and ""get stronger together"". Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson added that in 2024, Sweden would meet Nato's target of spending 2% of economic output (GDP) on military defence, doubling its spending since 2020. Defence specialist Oscar Jonsson said the tone of the warnings from defence chiefs was something of a storm in a teacup and that 90% of what had been said arose from frustration that too little was being done to build civil and military defence. ""Time is limited and it was aimed at being a wake-up call for agencies, individuals and departments,"" he told the BBC. ""The Swedish armed forces are incredibly competent, but the scale is nowhere near. The latest defence bill says we should set up 3.5 brigades, whereas Ukraine had 25 when the war started."" Gen Byden's warning to prepare mentally for war comes hard on the heels of a warning a month ago from the head of Poland's National Security Bureau (BBN), Jacek Siewiera, who said that ""to avoid war with Russia, countries on Nato's eastern flank should adopt a three-year time horizon to prepare for confrontation"". He said a German Council on Foreign Relations report suggesting Germany and Nato should prepare their armed forces to be able to fend off a Russian attack in six years was ""too optimistic"". Oscar Jonsson, a specialist from the Swedish Defence University, said that while war was a possibility, it would require several factors to fall into place: Russia's war in Ukraine coming to an end, its military having the time to rebuild and rearm its fighting force and for Europe to lose US military support.

Mariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wasik were sentenced to two years' jail last month for abuse of power when they led an anti-corruption office in 2007. Following the arrests, the new interior minister Marcin Kierwinski wrote on X: ""Everyone is equal before the law."" The arrests highlight the political turmoil between the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the new pro-EU coalition. The men, who were elected PiS MPs in October, refused to recognise last month's court decision because President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, pardoned them for the crime in 2015. Mr Duda has also said he does not recognise the court's ruling because he insists his pardon remains valid. The Polish president said in a televised address on Wednesday that he was deeply shaken by the two men being jailed, and described them as honest. The two MPs have been stripped of their parliamentary mandates, but both they and President Duda insist they remain legally elected MPs because of the pardon. On Monday evening, the court issued a warrant to police to detain the men. Despite this, Mr Duda invited both to Warsaw's Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning to attend a ceremony to swear in two of their former colleagues as presidential advisers. Several hours later, they emerged from the palace to speak briefly to reporters, all the while remaining inside its grounds. Mr Kaminski said they will be ""political prisoners"" if they are arrested and thanked Mr Duda for his support. ""We are dealing with a very serious state crisis. A grim dictatorship is being created,"" Mr Kaminski said. They then returned inside the palace as the political theatre unfolded. Moments later, Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference the situation was ""unbelievable"". He said the court's ruling must be respected and suggested President Duda was helping the men evade justice. ""There is no rulebook for the prime minister or interior minister on how to act when convicts are in the Presidential Palace. This is clearly taking advantage of a situation in which no one will use force against such an institution as the president,"" he added. Following the arrests, several hundred PiS supporters demonstrated outside the palace in support of the men. On Wednesday morning, Mariusz Kaminski announced he was going on hunger strike, ""as a political prisoner, from the first day of my imprisonment"". Hunger strikes are not an uncommon form of protest in Poland, and they do not necessarily mean a refusal to accept all food and liquids. The deputy justice minister stressed that neither of the men was a political prisoner but any prisoner had the right to refuse food or drink if they wished. Last year, the Polish Supreme Court ruled Mr Duda's 2015 pardon was invalid because it was issued while the men were appealing against their conviction, ie before the original conviction was final. Mr Duda disputes that and insists the pardon is still binding. To complicate matters, the Constitutional Tribunal and a new Supreme Court chamber, both of which are staffed by judges nominated by PiS, have ruled in favour of Mr Duda. Mr Tusk said Mr Duda could resolve the stand-off by pardoning the men again, now that the ruling is final. But that would call into question the legal status of the initial pardon. Mr Tusk's coalition took office last month pledging to undo PiS's changes to the judiciary, public media, and civil service that the European Commission and many other international bodies say have undermined the rule of law in Poland. One of its first acts was to reform the state TV, radio and news agency that PiS had transformed into a propaganda mouthpiece for its government. But its methods were similar to PiS's, first using a government minister to sack media boards and install new people ahead of planned legislative reform. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights acknowledged PiS had made it legally difficult to reform the public media, which it said required ""urgent reform"" because it had become ""a propaganda mouthpiece"" under PiS, but said the new government's changes ""raise serious doubts"". Former PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC Mr Tusk's government talked loudly about democratic standards but fell well short in practice. ""We are witnessing an unprecedented attack on the rule of law. Tusk's government decided it could take over public television and media by force. This has nothing to do with democratic standards. We have not seen such brutal government action since communism. It is all the more outrageous that this is done by people who have such slogans of democracy on their lips,"" Mr Morawiecki said. Given PiS's record of controlling state institutions while in office, many Tusk supporters argue such accusations are the height of hypocrisy.","['Poland', 'Donald Tusk', 'Andrzej Duda']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E520/production/_132265685_gettyimages-1913161993.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18160/production/_132265689_19efb1ef4e034cc335fb503941d8c937f1703af10_0_5917_33291000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/38D2/production/_132264541_a5e45657503cb0e8410607c7227b38f679cb974c.jpg']","['By Adam Easton', 'BBC News, Warsaw']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67917294,Scientists crack mystery of how MS gene spread,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts?",2024-01-10,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts? An international team of scientists say they have unearthed the answer in the DNA of ancient teeth and bones. The genes which protected our ancestors from animal diseases now raise the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The researchers call their discovery ""a quantum leap"" in understanding the evolution of the disease. And they say it could change opinions on what causes MS, and have an impact on the way it is treated. There are about twice as many cases of multiple sclerosis per 100,000 people in north-western Europe, including the UK and Scandinavia, compared with southern Europe. Researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Copenhagen and Oxford spent more than 10 years delving into archaeology to investigate why. MS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms like muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking. They discovered that genes which increase the risk of MS entered into north-western Europe about 5,000 years ago via a massive migration of cattle herders called Yamnaya. The Yamnaya came from western Russia, Ukraine and Kazhakstan, and moved west into Europe, says one of four Nature journal papers published on the topic. The findings ""astounded us all"", said Dr William Barrie, paper author and expert in computational analysis of ancient DNA at University of Cambridge. At the time, the gene variants carried by the herding people were an advantage, helping to protect them against diseases in their sheep and cattle. Nowadays, however, with modern lifestyles, diets and better hygiene, these gene variants have taken on a different role. In the present day, these same traits mean a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as MS. The research project was a huge undertaking - genetic information was extracted from ancient human remains found in Europe and Western Asia, and compared with the genes of hundreds of thousands of people living in the UK today. In the process, a bank of DNA from 5,000 ancient humans, kept in museum collections across many countries, has now been set up to help future research. Prof Lars Fugger, paper author and MS doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, says the discovery helps ""demystify"" the disease. ""MS is not caused by mutations - it's driven by normal genes to protect us against pathogens,"" he explains. Vaccinations, antibiotics and higher standards of hygiene have changed the disease landscape completely - many diseases have disappeared and people are living decades longer. The researchers say modern immune systems may now be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like MS, where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it. Drugs currently used to treat MS target the body's immune system, but the downside is the risk of suppressing it so much that patients struggle to fight off infections. When treating it, we are up against evolutionary forces, Prof Fugger says. ""We need to find the sweet spot where there is a balance with the immune system, rather than wiping it out."" The team now plans to look for other diseases in ancient DNA and follow them back in time. Their research could reveal more about the origins of autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression. Another Nature paper uncovered even more clues about our genetic past - that the Yamnaya herders could also be responsible for north-western Europeans being taller than southern Europeans. And while northern Europeans carry more genetic risk for MS, southern Europeans are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, and eastern Europeans more likely to have Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. DNA from pre-historic hunter-gatherer people raises the risk of Alzheimer's, but ancient farmers' genes are linked to mood disorders, the research explains. It also discovered that humans' ability to digest milk and other dairy products and survive on a vegetable-heavy diet only emerged about 6,000 years ago. Before that, they were meat-eaters. The research compared DNA from thousands of ancient skeletons found in Eurasia to genetic samples from current-day Europeans.","['Archaeology', 'Genetics', 'DNA', 'Health', 'Europe', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1182E/production/_132262717_illustration_3_creditsayostudio.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12651/production/_132254357_gettyimages-1205541058.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A2FE/production/_132262714_ms_gene_migration_map_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C4C8/production/_132267305_976_skull.jpg']","['By Philippa Roxby', 'Health reporter']",World,Europe

Up to 200 cattle, calves and horses were stranded on Krcedin island northwest of the capital Belgrade, after water levels swelled last week, blocking their passage back to shore. Evacuation efforts began on Tuesday, when some 60 animals were saved. Rescuers are now under pressure to save the rest as freezing temperatures and fears of starvation set in. The Danube snakes its way for 2,900km (1,800 miles) through 10 European countries from Germany's Black Forest via Serbia to the Black Sea. The island, Krcedinska Ada, is situated on its left bank, 3km from the shore and around 50km up river from Belgrade. Unseasonably mild weather in the Balkan region in late 2023 led to melting snow that caused water levels to rise sharply. But this week, the balmy weather gave way to snowfall and freezing temperatures, raising fears for the animals' survival. For days, farmers appealed to have their livestock rescued from the island as conditions worsened. On Tuesday, rescue teams deployed by the Serbian military, the emergencies department, the forestry agency and local citizens arrived with a raft to transfer the animals. Two loads of around 30 animals each were transported safely to shore, but further attempts were stalled due to a series of problems. The first raft had to be replaced due to missing railings, BBC Serbian reported. Then after just two runs its replacement broke down. Environmental group Eko Straza (Eco Guard) added that the cattle were exhausted and had lost as much as 50kg of their weight. Serbian news agency Tanjug said a new boat was then hired for the rescue to resume on Wednesday. Difficulties also arose in transporting dozens of wild horses, which are not used to human contact except for people bringing them food. Experts said that would likely be the greatest task of the operation. Speed has now become of utmost importance, because of the freezing conditions and increasing hunger. Cattle breeder Milenko Plavsic said some of his animals had already died and that the lives of those remaining were at risk. Some had also run away, he said. For days he has been warning that his cattle could die because the high water levels have meant they have been unable to graze. In a normal year, Mr Plavsic explained that the animals would return home by wading for 10km through shallow waters.",['Serbia'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/107F8/production/_132267576_gettyimages-1912881908.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17D28/production/_132267579_gettyimages-1912863457.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4890/production/_132267581_gettyimages-1912861138.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1102C/production/_132267696_gettyimages-1912883387.jpg']","['By Emily Atkinson', 'BBC News']",World,Europe

Mariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wasik were sentenced to two years' jail last month for abuse of power when they led an anti-corruption office in 2007. Following the arrests, the new interior minister Marcin Kierwinski wrote on X: ""Everyone is equal before the law."" The arrests highlight the political turmoil between the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the new pro-EU coalition. The men, who were elected PiS MPs in October, refused to recognise last month's court decision because President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, pardoned them for the crime in 2015. Mr Duda has also said he does not recognise the court's ruling because he insists his pardon remains valid. The Polish president said in a televised address on Wednesday that he was deeply shaken by the two men being jailed, and described them as honest. The two MPs have been stripped of their parliamentary mandates, but both they and President Duda insist they remain legally elected MPs because of the pardon. On Monday evening, the court issued a warrant to police to detain the men. Despite this, Mr Duda invited both to Warsaw's Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning to attend a ceremony to swear in two of their former colleagues as presidential advisers. Several hours later, they emerged from the palace to speak briefly to reporters, all the while remaining inside its grounds. Mr Kaminski said they will be ""political prisoners"" if they are arrested and thanked Mr Duda for his support. ""We are dealing with a very serious state crisis. A grim dictatorship is being created,"" Mr Kaminski said. They then returned inside the palace as the political theatre unfolded.

Marlene Engelhorn, who is 31 and lives in Vienna, wants 50 Austrians to determine how €25m (£21.5m) of her inheritance should be redistributed. ""I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,"" she said. ""And the state doesn't even want taxes on it."" Austria abolished inheritance tax in 2008, one of a handful of European countries that do not impose inheritance tax - or death duties. Ms Engelhorn believes that is unfair. She is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, the founder of German chemical and pharmaceutical company, BASF, and inherited millions when her grandmother died in September 2022. Traudl Engelhorn-Vechiatto's wealth was estimated by US magazine Forbes at $4.2bn (£3.3bn: €3.8bn), and even before she died her grand-daughter had declared that she wanted to hand out about 90% of her inheritance. On Wednesday, 10,000 invitations targeting randomly selected Austrian citizens began arriving in letterboxes in Austria. Those who wish to take part in Ms Engelhorn's initiative, known as the Good Council for Redistribution, can register online or by phone. From that initial sample of 10,000 Austrians who are all aged over 16, 50 people will be chosen, with 15 substitute members also selected in case of dropouts. ""If politicians don't do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself,"" she explained in her statement. ""Many people struggle to make ends meet with a full-time job, and pay taxes on every euro they earn from work. I see this as a failure of politics, and if politics fails, then the citizens have to deal with it themselves."" Christoph Hofinger, Managing Director of the Foresight Institute which is supporting the initiative, said the council to redistribute the heiress's money would be made up of 50 people ""from all age groups, federal states, social classes and backgrounds"". The group will be asked to ""contribute their ideas in order to jointly develop solutions in the interests of society as a whole"", he said. They will take part in a series of meetings to be held in Salzburg with academics and civil society organisations from March to June this year. Organisers say the meetings will be barrier-free, with childcare and interpreters available if required. Travel costs will be covered and participants will receive €1,200 for every weekend they attend. Marlene Engelhorn believes their discussions will be a ""service to democracy"" and so they should be properly compensated for it. ""I have no veto rights,"" she said: ""I am putting my assets at the disposal of these 50 people and placing my trust in them."" If they cannot come up with a ""widely supported"" decision on what to do with the money, then the money goes back to Ms Engelhorn. It is not clear exactly what proportion of her inheritance is being given away, although back in 2021 she said she wanted to hand out at least 90% of it because she had done nothing to earn it and had merely struck lucky in a ""birth lottery"". Her team has not confirmed how much she is holding back although it said she was retaining some kind of financial buffer. Sixteen years after Austria abolished inheritance tax, it remains contentious, and one major political party, the opposition Social Democrats, wants it reinstated. Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler told public broadcaster ORF that he wanted it to be a central condition for potential coalition negotiations, after Austria's next general election which is due later this year. The conservative People's Party, which is currently the senior partner in Austria's coalition government with the Greens, has rejected his proposal. Its general secretary, Christian Stocker, said that while Mr Babler wanted to ""to further burden people in our country with his call for a wealth and inheritance tax, the People's Party is providing relief. We reject new taxes: people must be left with more net income.""",['Austria'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5CCC/production/_132265732_obs_20240109_obs0032.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E27/production/_124870002_0a6ee93a-57d9-41d6-ae4a-6089d9a91981.jpg']","['By Bethany Bell', 'BBC News, Vienna']",World,Europe

""MS is not caused by mutations - it's driven by normal genes to protect us against pathogens,"" he explains. Vaccinations, antibiotics and higher standards of hygiene have changed the disease landscape completely - many diseases have disappeared and people are living decades longer. The researchers say modern immune systems may now be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like MS, where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it. Drugs currently used to treat MS target the body's immune system, but the downside is the risk of suppressing it so much that patients struggle to fight off infections. When treating it, we are up against evolutionary forces, Prof Fugger says. ""We need to find the sweet spot where there is a balance with the immune system, rather than wiping it out."" The team now plans to look for other diseases in ancient DNA and follow them back in time. Their research could reveal more about the origins of autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression. Another Nature paper uncovered even more clues about our genetic past - that the Yamnaya herders could also be responsible for north-western Europeans being taller than southern Europeans. And while northern Europeans carry more genetic risk for MS, southern Europeans are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, and eastern Europeans more likely to have Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. DNA from pre-historic hunter-gatherer people raises the risk of Alzheimer's, but ancient farmers' genes are linked to mood disorders, the research explains. It also discovered that humans' ability to digest milk and other dairy products and survive on a vegetable-heavy diet only emerged about 6,000 years ago. Before that, they were meat-eaters. The research compared DNA from thousands of ancient skeletons found in Eurasia to genetic samples from current-day Europeans.","['Archaeology', 'Genetics', 'DNA', 'Health', 'Europe', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1182E/production/_132262717_illustration_3_creditsayostudio.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12651/production/_132254357_gettyimages-1205541058.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A2FE/production/_132262714_ms_gene_migration_map_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C4C8/production/_132267305_976_skull.jpg']","['By Philippa Roxby', 'Health reporter']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67929549,Polish police arrest MPs in presidential palace,Polish police have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw in a day of unprecedented political theatre.,2024-01-10,"Polish police have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw in a day of unprecedented political theatre. Mariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wasik were sentenced to two years' jail last month for abuse of power when they led an anti-corruption office in 2007. Following the arrests, the new interior minister Marcin Kierwinski wrote on X: ""Everyone is equal before the law."" The arrests highlight the political turmoil between the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the new pro-EU coalition. The men, who were elected PiS MPs in October, refused to recognise last month's court decision because President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, pardoned them for the crime in 2015. Mr Duda has also said he does not recognise the court's ruling because he insists his pardon remains valid. The Polish president said in a televised address on Wednesday that he was deeply shaken by the two men being jailed, and described them as honest. The two MPs have been stripped of their parliamentary mandates, but both they and President Duda insist they remain legally elected MPs because of the pardon. On Monday evening, the court issued a warrant to police to detain the men. Despite this, Mr Duda invited both to Warsaw's Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning to attend a ceremony to swear in two of their former colleagues as presidential advisers. Several hours later, they emerged from the palace to speak briefly to reporters, all the while remaining inside its grounds. Mr Kaminski said they will be ""political prisoners"" if they are arrested and thanked Mr Duda for his support. ""We are dealing with a very serious state crisis. A grim dictatorship is being created,"" Mr Kaminski said. They then returned inside the palace as the political theatre unfolded. Moments later, Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference the situation was ""unbelievable"". He said the court's ruling must be respected and suggested President Duda was helping the men evade justice. ""There is no rulebook for the prime minister or interior minister on how to act when convicts are in the Presidential Palace. This is clearly taking advantage of a situation in which no one will use force against such an institution as the president,"" he added. Following the arrests, several hundred PiS supporters demonstrated outside the palace in support of the men. On Wednesday morning, Mariusz Kaminski announced he was going on hunger strike, ""as a political prisoner, from the first day of my imprisonment"". Hunger strikes are not an uncommon form of protest in Poland, and they do not necessarily mean a refusal to accept all food and liquids. The deputy justice minister stressed that neither of the men was a political prisoner but any prisoner had the right to refuse food or drink if they wished. Last year, the Polish Supreme Court ruled Mr Duda's 2015 pardon was invalid because it was issued while the men were appealing against their conviction, ie before the original conviction was final. Mr Duda disputes that and insists the pardon is still binding. To complicate matters, the Constitutional Tribunal and a new Supreme Court chamber, both of which are staffed by judges nominated by PiS, have ruled in favour of Mr Duda. Mr Tusk said Mr Duda could resolve the stand-off by pardoning the men again, now that the ruling is final. But that would call into question the legal status of the initial pardon. Mr Tusk's coalition took office last month pledging to undo PiS's changes to the judiciary, public media, and civil service that the European Commission and many other international bodies say have undermined the rule of law in Poland. One of its first acts was to reform the state TV, radio and news agency that PiS had transformed into a propaganda mouthpiece for its government. But its methods were similar to PiS's, first using a government minister to sack media boards and install new people ahead of planned legislative reform. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights acknowledged PiS had made it legally difficult to reform the public media, which it said required ""urgent reform"" because it had become ""a propaganda mouthpiece"" under PiS, but said the new government's changes ""raise serious doubts"". Former PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC Mr Tusk's government talked loudly about democratic standards but fell well short in practice. ""We are witnessing an unprecedented attack on the rule of law. Tusk's government decided it could take over public television and media by force. This has nothing to do with democratic standards. We have not seen such brutal government action since communism. It is all the more outrageous that this is done by people who have such slogans of democracy on their lips,"" Mr Morawiecki said. Given PiS's record of controlling state institutions while in office, many Tusk supporters argue such accusations are the height of hypocrisy.","['Poland', 'Donald Tusk', 'Andrzej Duda']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E520/production/_132265685_gettyimages-1913161993.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18160/production/_132265689_19efb1ef4e034cc335fb503941d8c937f1703af10_0_5917_33291000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/38D2/production/_132264541_a5e45657503cb0e8410607c7227b38f679cb974c.jpg']","['By Adam Easton', 'BBC News, Warsaw']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67935463,Austrian heiress Marlene Engelhorn announces plan for €25m giveaway,An Austro-German heiress is setting up a citizens group to decide how she should give away much of the fortune she inherited from her grandmother.,2024-01-10,"An Austro-German heiress is setting up a citizens group to decide how she should give away much of the fortune she inherited from her grandmother. Marlene Engelhorn, who is 31 and lives in Vienna, wants 50 Austrians to determine how €25m (£21.5m) of her inheritance should be redistributed. ""I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,"" she said. ""And the state doesn't even want taxes on it."" Austria abolished inheritance tax in 2008, one of a handful of European countries that do not impose inheritance tax - or death duties. Ms Engelhorn believes that is unfair. She is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, the founder of German chemical and pharmaceutical company, BASF, and inherited millions when her grandmother died in September 2022. Traudl Engelhorn-Vechiatto's wealth was estimated by US magazine Forbes at $4.2bn (£3.3bn: €3.8bn), and even before she died her grand-daughter had declared that she wanted to hand out about 90% of her inheritance. On Wednesday, 10,000 invitations targeting randomly selected Austrian citizens began arriving in letterboxes in Austria. Those who wish to take part in Ms Engelhorn's initiative, known as the Good Council for Redistribution, can register online or by phone. From that initial sample of 10,000 Austrians who are all aged over 16, 50 people will be chosen, with 15 substitute members also selected in case of dropouts. ""If politicians don't do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself,"" she explained in her statement. ""Many people struggle to make ends meet with a full-time job, and pay taxes on every euro they earn from work. I see this as a failure of politics, and if politics fails, then the citizens have to deal with it themselves."" Christoph Hofinger, Managing Director of the Foresight Institute which is supporting the initiative, said the council to redistribute the heiress's money would be made up of 50 people ""from all age groups, federal states, social classes and backgrounds"". The group will be asked to ""contribute their ideas in order to jointly develop solutions in the interests of society as a whole"", he said. They will take part in a series of meetings to be held in Salzburg with academics and civil society organisations from March to June this year. Organisers say the meetings will be barrier-free, with childcare and interpreters available if required. Travel costs will be covered and participants will receive €1,200 for every weekend they attend. Marlene Engelhorn believes their discussions will be a ""service to democracy"" and so they should be properly compensated for it. ""I have no veto rights,"" she said: ""I am putting my assets at the disposal of these 50 people and placing my trust in them."" If they cannot come up with a ""widely supported"" decision on what to do with the money, then the money goes back to Ms Engelhorn. It is not clear exactly what proportion of her inheritance is being given away, although back in 2021 she said she wanted to hand out at least 90% of it because she had done nothing to earn it and had merely struck lucky in a ""birth lottery"". Her team has not confirmed how much she is holding back although it said she was retaining some kind of financial buffer. Sixteen years after Austria abolished inheritance tax, it remains contentious, and one major political party, the opposition Social Democrats, wants it reinstated. Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler told public broadcaster ORF that he wanted it to be a central condition for potential coalition negotiations, after Austria's next general election which is due later this year. The conservative People's Party, which is currently the senior partner in Austria's coalition government with the Greens, has rejected his proposal. Its general secretary, Christian Stocker, said that while Mr Babler wanted to ""to further burden people in our country with his call for a wealth and inheritance tax, the People's Party is providing relief. We reject new taxes: people must be left with more net income.""",['Austria'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5CCC/production/_132265732_obs_20240109_obs0032.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E27/production/_124870002_0a6ee93a-57d9-41d6-ae4a-6089d9a91981.jpg']","['By Bethany Bell', 'BBC News, Vienna']",World,Europe

Up to 200 cattle, calves and horses were stranded on Krcedin island northwest of the capital Belgrade, after water levels swelled last week, blocking their passage back to shore. Evacuation efforts began on Tuesday, when some 60 animals were saved. Rescuers are now under pressure to save the rest as freezing temperatures and fears of starvation set in. The Danube snakes its way for 2,900km (1,800 miles) through 10 European countries from Germany's Black Forest via Serbia to the Black Sea. The island, Krcedinska Ada, is situated on its left bank, 3km from the shore and around 50km up river from Belgrade. Unseasonably mild weather in the Balkan region in late 2023 led to melting snow that caused water levels to rise sharply. But this week, the balmy weather gave way to snowfall and freezing temperatures, raising fears for the animals' survival. For days, farmers appealed to have their livestock rescued from the island as conditions worsened. On Tuesday, rescue teams deployed by the Serbian military, the emergencies department, the forestry agency and local citizens arrived with a raft to transfer the animals. Two loads of around 30 animals each were transported safely to shore, but further attempts were stalled due to a series of problems. The first raft had to be replaced due to missing railings, BBC Serbian reported. Then after just two runs its replacement broke down. Environmental group Eko Straza (Eco Guard) added that the cattle were exhausted and had lost as much as 50kg of their weight. Serbian news agency Tanjug said a new boat was then hired for the rescue to resume on Wednesday. Difficulties also arose in transporting dozens of wild horses, which are not used to human contact except for people bringing them food. Experts said that would likely be the greatest task of the operation. Speed has now become of utmost importance, because of the freezing conditions and increasing hunger. Cattle breeder Milenko Plavsic said some of his animals had already died and that the lives of those remaining were at risk. Some had also run away, he said. For days he has been warning that his cattle could die because the high water levels have meant they have been unable to graze. In a normal year, Mr Plavsic explained that the animals would return home by wading for 10km through shallow waters.",['Serbia'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/107F8/production/_132267576_gettyimages-1912881908.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17D28/production/_132267579_gettyimages-1912863457.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4890/production/_132267581_gettyimages-1912861138.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1102C/production/_132267696_gettyimages-1912883387.jpg']","['By Emily Atkinson', 'BBC News']",World,Europe

A party of 35 reportedly ate and drank their way through the dinner at Atmosfär, a restaurant in the southern city of Malmö, on Christmas Day. They then allegedly left without paying. Police closed an initial investigation into the case on Monday but it was reopened by prosecutors on Wednesday. Over the evening on 25 December, the group ordered around £1,900 worth of food and £4,400 worth of drinks, a copy of their bill obtained by Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan showed. The party then reportedly left in a number of taxis without paying. Police were first alerted to the suspected fraud at 23:00 local time on Christmas Day and officers located and stopped several vehicles in different parts of the city, the newspaper reported. One taxi carrying four people - a man, 45, a 35-year-old woman, and two children - was stopped. The case, which has attracted significant public and media attention in Sweden, was subject to a preliminary investigation by Malmö police. Police said Atmosfär had sent an invoice to the person who made the reservation, which included late payment interest of 10%. The invoice has not yet been paid, but officers said it was up to the restaurant to take the matter further with a debt collection company. On Wednesday, prosecutor Henrik Nordquist told Sydsvenskan that while he respected the police's decision, he had made a different assessment. He said the case was reopened because of major public interest. Atmosfär is described by the Michelin Guide as a ""formal yet relaxed eatery"" and boasts an extensive wine list while serving traditional dishes from Scania, Sweden's southernmost region.","['Sweden', 'Restaurants', 'Malmo']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5128/production/_132267702_atmosfar.png'],"['By Emily Atkinson', 'BBC News']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67917294,Scientists crack mystery of how MS gene spread,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts?",2024-01-10,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts? An international team of scientists say they have unearthed the answer in the DNA of ancient teeth and bones. The genes which protected our ancestors from animal diseases now raise the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The researchers call their discovery ""a quantum leap"" in understanding the evolution of the disease. And they say it could change opinions on what causes MS, and have an impact on the way it is treated. There are about twice as many cases of multiple sclerosis per 100,000 people in north-western Europe, including the UK and Scandinavia, compared with southern Europe. Researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Copenhagen and Oxford spent more than 10 years delving into archaeology to investigate why. MS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms like muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking. They discovered that genes which increase the risk of MS entered into north-western Europe about 5,000 years ago via a massive migration of cattle herders called Yamnaya. The Yamnaya came from western Russia, Ukraine and Kazhakstan, and moved west into Europe, says one of four Nature journal papers published on the topic. The findings ""astounded us all"", said Dr William Barrie, paper author and expert in computational analysis of ancient DNA at University of Cambridge. At the time, the gene variants carried by the herding people were an advantage, helping to protect them against diseases in their sheep and cattle. Nowadays, however, with modern lifestyles, diets and better hygiene, these gene variants have taken on a different role. In the present day, these same traits mean a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as MS. The research project was a huge undertaking - genetic information was extracted from ancient human remains found in Europe and Western Asia, and compared with the genes of hundreds of thousands of people living in the UK today. In the process, a bank of DNA from 5,000 ancient humans, kept in museum collections across many countries, has now been set up to help future research.

If Israel is not excluded from the competition, they want public broadcaster Yle to withdraw Finland's entry from the competition. Yle has said it is monitoring the position of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), organiser of the contest. Last month, Icelandic musicians made similar demands to broadcaster Rúv. Lukas Korpelainen, one of the petition's authors, told newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet it was not acceptable for Israel to ""take part in the Eurovision Song Contest to polish its image"". Signatories include Finnish artists Olavi Uusivirta, Paleface and Axel Ehnström, who represented the country in the 2011 contest. The petition accuses broadcaster Yle of double standards, saying it was among the first to demand a ban on Russia from the 2022 contest, ""and we expect the same active defending of values from Yle now as well"". A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Yle representative Ville Vilén said Moscow's attack was ""contrary to all the values that Yle and other European broadcasters represent"". The EBU soon after banned Russia from participating. Mr Vilén has said the situation in Israel and Gaza is ""not quite the same"". ""As gruesome as it is, it is not a war of inter-state aggression like between Russia and Ukraine,"" he told Finnish tabloid Ilta Sanomat a few weeks ago. Yle's head of communications Jere Nurminen told Hufvudstadsbladet the company was following the situation and talking to the EBU and other public broadcasters. Yle was also planning to meet the petition's authors, he added. In mid-December the EBU released a statement saying Eurovision was ""for broadcasters - not for governments"" and that Israel had taken part for 50 years. It said member organisations had agreed that Israel's public broadcaster ""complies with all competition rules"" and insisted the contest was a ""non-political event"". The BBC has approached Israel's culture ministry and public broadcaster Kan for comment. This year's Eurovision will take place in the Swedish city of Malmö, with the United Kingdom represented by pop star Olly Alexander. After it emerged that Alexander had endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide, an Israeli official told the UK's Telegraph newspaper the arguments were ""absurd"" and accused signatories of ""anti-Israel bias"". More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's military campaign - mostly women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The war was triggered after an attack by gunmen belonging to Hamas - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western governments - on southern Israel. About 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed, with about 240 others taken hostage. Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza before mounting a ground operation with the stated aim of ""destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"" as well as freeing the hostages. A total blockade of Gaza by the Israeli military has cut off supplies of food, medicines and fuel. UN agencies say 26% of Gazans - 576,600 people - have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face ""catastrophic hunger and starvation"". According to Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, 1.9 million Gazan residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced, and 1.4 million of them are sheltering in its facilities.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Iceland', 'Eurovision Song Contest', 'Finland', 'Israel']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/108D/production/_132273240_6fa22a2163b79eca476f9583a2aa1f2fba574217.jpg'],"['By Phelan Chatterjee', 'BBC News']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67935464,Swedish alarm after defence chiefs' war warning,A warning to Swedes from two top defence officials to prepare for war has prompted concern and accusations of alarmism.,2024-01-10,"A warning to Swedes from two top defence officials to prepare for war has prompted concern and accusations of alarmism. Civil Defence Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin told a defence conference ""there could be war in Sweden"". His message was then backed up by military commander-in-chief Gen Micael Byden, who said all Swedes should prepare mentally for the possibility. However, opposition politicians have objected to the tone of the warnings. Ex-prime minister Magdalena Andersson told Swedish TV that while the security situation was serious, ""it is not as if war is just outside the door."" Children's rights organisation Bris said that its national helpline did not usually receive calls about the possibility of war. But this week, it had seen an increase in worried calls from youngsters who had seen news reports or posts on TikTok talking about it. ""This was well prepared, it wasn't something blurted out,"" Bris spokeswoman Maja Dahl told the BBC. ""They should have provided information meant for kids when they come out with this kind of information for grown-ups."" Despite the starkness of the messaging, the remarks from the civil defence minister and military chief are being seen as a wake-up call. After more than two centuries of peace, Sweden is a few steps from joining the Nato defensive alliance, waiting for a green light from Turkey's parliament and then from Hungary. The commander-in-chief said his remarks were nothing new. He visited Ukraine's eastern front a month ago and Sweden is one of a group of countries training Ukrainian pilots. Stockholm is also said to be considering sending advanced Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine. ""My ambition with this is not to worry people: my ambition is to get more people to think about their own situation and their own responsibilities,"" Gen Byden later told Aftonbladet newspaper. Finland has already joined Nato, and Russian officials have suggested it will be ""the first to suffer"" if tensions with Nato escalate. Sweden's civil defence minister said his aim was not for people to lose sleep, but to gain awareness of what was really going on. He appealed to local authorities, emergency planners and individuals to respond. ""If there is one thing that keeps me awake at night, it is the feeling that things are moving too slowly,"" Mr Bohlin told the Society and Defence conference on Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Sweden during the conference to work with his country and others to manufacture weapons and ""get stronger together"". Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson added that in 2024, Sweden would meet Nato's target of spending 2% of economic output (GDP) on military defence, doubling its spending since 2020. Defence specialist Oscar Jonsson said the tone of the warnings from defence chiefs was something of a storm in a teacup and that 90% of what had been said arose from frustration that too little was being done to build civil and military defence. ""Time is limited and it was aimed at being a wake-up call for agencies, individuals and departments,"" he told the BBC. ""The Swedish armed forces are incredibly competent, but the scale is nowhere near. The latest defence bill says we should set up 3.5 brigades, whereas Ukraine had 25 when the war started."" Gen Byden's warning to prepare mentally for war comes hard on the heels of a warning a month ago from the head of Poland's National Security Bureau (BBN), Jacek Siewiera, who said that ""to avoid war with Russia, countries on Nato's eastern flank should adopt a three-year time horizon to prepare for confrontation"". He said a German Council on Foreign Relations report suggesting Germany and Nato should prepare their armed forces to be able to fend off a Russian attack in six years was ""too optimistic"". Oscar Jonsson, a specialist from the Swedish Defence University, said that while war was a possibility, it would require several factors to fall into place: Russia's war in Ukraine coming to an end, its military having the time to rebuild and rearm its fighting force and for Europe to lose US military support. All of which were within the realms of possibility, he added.","['Russia', 'Sweden', 'War in Ukraine', 'Ukraine', 'Finland', 'Nato']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17E5/production/_132271160_gettyimages-1662883735.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FE5D/production/_132271156_gettyimages-1909774981.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14C7D/production/_132271158_gettyimages-1907824113.jpg']","['By Paul Kirby', 'BBC News']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67941086,Eurovision: Finnish artists want Israel barred from contest over Gaza war,"More than 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals have signed a petition urging a ban on Israel from Eurovision over alleged ""war crimes"" in Gaza.",2024-01-10,"More than 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals have signed a petition urging a ban on Israel from Eurovision over alleged ""war crimes"" in Gaza. If Israel is not excluded from the competition, they want public broadcaster Yle to withdraw Finland's entry from the competition. Yle has said it is monitoring the position of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), organiser of the contest. Last month, Icelandic musicians made similar demands to broadcaster Rúv. Lukas Korpelainen, one of the petition's authors, told newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet it was not acceptable for Israel to ""take part in the Eurovision Song Contest to polish its image"". Signatories include Finnish artists Olavi Uusivirta, Paleface and Axel Ehnström, who represented the country in the 2011 contest. The petition accuses broadcaster Yle of double standards, saying it was among the first to demand a ban on Russia from the 2022 contest, ""and we expect the same active defending of values from Yle now as well"". A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Yle representative Ville Vilén said Moscow's attack was ""contrary to all the values that Yle and other European broadcasters represent"". The EBU soon after banned Russia from participating. Mr Vilén has said the situation in Israel and Gaza is ""not quite the same"". ""As gruesome as it is, it is not a war of inter-state aggression like between Russia and Ukraine,"" he told Finnish tabloid Ilta Sanomat a few weeks ago. Yle's head of communications Jere Nurminen told Hufvudstadsbladet the company was following the situation and talking to the EBU and other public broadcasters. Yle was also planning to meet the petition's authors, he added. In mid-December the EBU released a statement saying Eurovision was ""for broadcasters - not for governments"" and that Israel had taken part for 50 years. It said member organisations had agreed that Israel's public broadcaster ""complies with all competition rules"" and insisted the contest was a ""non-political event"". The BBC has approached Israel's culture ministry and public broadcaster Kan for comment. This year's Eurovision will take place in the Swedish city of Malmö, with the United Kingdom represented by pop star Olly Alexander. After it emerged that Alexander had endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide, an Israeli official told the UK's Telegraph newspaper the arguments were ""absurd"" and accused signatories of ""anti-Israel bias"". More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's military campaign - mostly women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The war was triggered after an attack by gunmen belonging to Hamas - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western governments - on southern Israel. About 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed, with about 240 others taken hostage. Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza before mounting a ground operation with the stated aim of ""destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"" as well as freeing the hostages. A total blockade of Gaza by the Israeli military has cut off supplies of food, medicines and fuel. UN agencies say 26% of Gazans - 576,600 people - have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face ""catastrophic hunger and starvation"". According to Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, 1.9 million Gazan residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced, and 1.4 million of them are sheltering in its facilities.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Iceland', 'Eurovision Song Contest', 'Finland', 'Israel']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/108D/production/_132273240_6fa22a2163b79eca476f9583a2aa1f2fba574217.jpg'],"['By Phelan Chatterjee', 'BBC News']",World,Europe

A party of 35 reportedly ate and drank their way through the dinner at Atmosfär, a restaurant in the southern city of Malmö, on Christmas Day. They then allegedly left without paying. Police closed an initial investigation into the case on Monday but it was reopened by prosecutors on Wednesday. Over the evening on 25 December, the group ordered around £1,900 worth of food and £4,400 worth of drinks, a copy of their bill obtained by Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan showed. The party then reportedly left in a number of taxis without paying. Police were first alerted to the suspected fraud at 23:00 local time on Christmas Day and officers located and stopped several vehicles in different parts of the city, the newspaper reported. One taxi carrying four people - a man, 45, a 35-year-old woman, and two children - was stopped. The case, which has attracted significant public and media attention in Sweden, was subject to a preliminary investigation by Malmö police. Police said Atmosfär had sent an invoice to the person who made the reservation, which included late payment interest of 10%. The invoice has not yet been paid, but officers said it was up to the restaurant to take the matter further with a debt collection company. On Wednesday, prosecutor Henrik Nordquist told Sydsvenskan that while he respected the police's decision, he had made a different assessment. He said the case was reopened because of major public interest. Atmosfär is described by the Michelin Guide as a ""formal yet relaxed eatery"" and boasts an extensive wine list while serving traditional dishes from Scania, Sweden's southernmost region.","['Sweden', 'Restaurants', 'Malmo']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5128/production/_132267702_atmosfar.png'],"['By Emily Atkinson', 'BBC News']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67917294,Scientists crack mystery of how MS gene spread,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts?",2024-01-10,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts? An international team of scientists say they have unearthed the answer in the DNA of ancient teeth and bones. The genes which protected our ancestors from animal diseases now raise the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The researchers call their discovery ""a quantum leap"" in understanding the evolution of the disease. And they say it could change opinions on what causes MS, and have an impact on the way it is treated. There are about twice as many cases of multiple sclerosis per 100,000 people in north-western Europe, including the UK and Scandinavia, compared with southern Europe. Researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Copenhagen and Oxford spent more than 10 years delving into archaeology to investigate why. MS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms like muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking. They discovered that genes which increase the risk of MS entered into north-western Europe about 5,000 years ago via a massive migration of cattle herders called Yamnaya. The Yamnaya came from western Russia, Ukraine and Kazhakstan, and moved west into Europe, says one of four Nature journal papers published on the topic. The findings ""astounded us all"", said Dr William Barrie, paper author and expert in computational analysis of ancient DNA at University of Cambridge. At the time, the gene variants carried by the herding people were an advantage, helping to protect them against diseases in their sheep and cattle. Nowadays, however, with modern lifestyles, diets and better hygiene, these gene variants have taken on a different role. In the present day, these same traits mean a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as MS. The research project was a huge undertaking - genetic information was extracted from ancient human remains found in Europe and Western Asia, and compared with the genes of hundreds of thousands of people living in the UK today. In the process, a bank of DNA from 5,000 ancient humans, kept in museum collections across many countries, has now been set up to help future research. Prof Lars Fugger, paper author and MS doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, says the discovery helps ""demystify"" the disease. ""MS is not caused by mutations - it's driven by normal genes to protect us against pathogens,"" he explains. Vaccinations, antibiotics and higher standards of hygiene have changed the disease landscape completely - many diseases have disappeared and people are living decades longer. The researchers say modern immune systems may now be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like MS, where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it. Drugs currently used to treat MS target the body's immune system, but the downside is the risk of suppressing it so much that patients struggle to fight off infections. When treating it, we are up against evolutionary forces, Prof Fugger says. ""We need to find the sweet spot where there is a balance with the immune system, rather than wiping it out."" The team now plans to look for other diseases in ancient DNA and follow them back in time. Their research could reveal more about the origins of autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression. Another Nature paper uncovered even more clues about our genetic past - that the Yamnaya herders could also be responsible for north-western Europeans being taller than southern Europeans. And while northern Europeans carry more genetic risk for MS, southern Europeans are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, and eastern Europeans more likely to have Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. DNA from pre-historic hunter-gatherer people raises the risk of Alzheimer's, but ancient farmers' genes are linked to mood disorders, the research explains. It also discovered that humans' ability to digest milk and other dairy products and survive on a vegetable-heavy diet only emerged about 6,000 years ago. Before that, they were meat-eaters. The research compared DNA from thousands of ancient skeletons found in Eurasia to genetic samples from current-day Europeans.","['Archaeology', 'Genetics', 'DNA', 'Health', 'Europe', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1182E/production/_132262717_illustration_3_creditsayostudio.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12651/production/_132254357_gettyimages-1205541058.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A2FE/production/_132262714_ms_gene_migration_map_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C4C8/production/_132267305_976_skull.jpg']","['By Philippa Roxby', 'Health reporter']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67935463,Austrian heiress Marlene Engelhorn announces plan for €25m giveaway,An Austro-German heiress is setting up a citizens group to decide how she should give away much of the fortune she inherited from her grandmother.,2024-01-10,"An Austro-German heiress is setting up a citizens group to decide how she should give away much of the fortune she inherited from her grandmother. Marlene Engelhorn, who is 31 and lives in Vienna, wants 50 Austrians to determine how €25m (£21.5m) of her inheritance should be redistributed. ""I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,"" she said. ""And the state doesn't even want taxes on it."" Austria abolished inheritance tax in 2008, one of a handful of European countries that do not impose inheritance tax - or death duties. Ms Engelhorn believes that is unfair. She is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, the founder of German chemical and pharmaceutical company, BASF, and inherited millions when her grandmother died in September 2022. Traudl Engelhorn-Vechiatto's wealth was estimated by US magazine Forbes at $4.2bn (£3.3bn: €3.8bn), and even before she died her grand-daughter had declared that she wanted to hand out about 90% of her inheritance. On Wednesday, 10,000 invitations targeting randomly selected Austrian citizens began arriving in letterboxes in Austria. Those who wish to take part in Ms Engelhorn's initiative, known as the Good Council for Redistribution, can register online or by phone. From that initial sample of 10,000 Austrians who are all aged over 16, 50 people will be chosen, with 15 substitute members also selected in case of dropouts. ""If politicians don't do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself,"" she explained in her statement. ""Many people struggle to make ends meet with a full-time job, and pay taxes on every euro they earn from work. I see this as a failure of politics, and if politics fails, then the citizens have to deal with it themselves."" Christoph Hofinger, Managing Director of the Foresight Institute which is supporting the initiative, said the council to redistribute the heiress's money would be made up of 50 people ""from all age groups, federal states, social classes and backgrounds"". The group will be asked to ""contribute their ideas in order to jointly develop solutions in the interests of society as a whole"", he said. They will take part in a series of meetings to be held in Salzburg with academics and civil society organisations from March to June this year. Organisers say the meetings will be barrier-free, with childcare and interpreters available if required. Travel costs will be covered and participants will receive €1,200 for every weekend they attend. Marlene Engelhorn believes their discussions will be a ""service to democracy"" and so they should be properly compensated for it. ""I have no veto rights,"" she said: ""I am putting my assets at the disposal of these 50 people and placing my trust in them."" If they cannot come up with a ""widely supported"" decision on what to do with the money, then the money goes back to Ms Engelhorn. It is not clear exactly what proportion of her inheritance is being given away, although back in 2021 she said she wanted to hand out at least 90% of it because she had done nothing to earn it and had merely struck lucky in a ""birth lottery"". Her team has not confirmed how much she is holding back although it said she was retaining some kind of financial buffer. Sixteen years after Austria abolished inheritance tax, it remains contentious, and one major political party, the opposition Social Democrats, wants it reinstated. Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler told public broadcaster ORF that he wanted it to be a central condition for potential coalition negotiations, after Austria's next general election which is due later this year. The conservative People's Party, which is currently the senior partner in Austria's coalition government with the Greens, has rejected his proposal. Its general secretary, Christian Stocker, said that while Mr Babler wanted to ""to further burden people in our country with his call for a wealth and inheritance tax, the People's Party is providing relief. We reject new taxes: people must be left with more net income.""",['Austria'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5CCC/production/_132265732_obs_20240109_obs0032.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E27/production/_124870002_0a6ee93a-57d9-41d6-ae4a-6089d9a91981.jpg']","['By Bethany Bell', 'BBC News, Vienna']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67929549,Polish police arrest MPs in presidential palace,Polish police have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw in a day of unprecedented political theatre.,2024-01-10,"Polish police have arrested the former interior minister and deputy interior minister inside the presidential palace in Warsaw in a day of unprecedented political theatre. Mariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wasik were sentenced to two years' jail last month for abuse of power when they led an anti-corruption office in 2007. Following the arrests, the new interior minister Marcin Kierwinski wrote on X: ""Everyone is equal before the law."" The arrests highlight the political turmoil between the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the new pro-EU coalition. The men, who were elected PiS MPs in October, refused to recognise last month's court decision because President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, pardoned them for the crime in 2015. Mr Duda has also said he does not recognise the court's ruling because he insists his pardon remains valid. The Polish president said in a televised address on Wednesday that he was deeply shaken by the two men being jailed, and described them as honest. The two MPs have been stripped of their parliamentary mandates, but both they and President Duda insist they remain legally elected MPs because of the pardon. On Monday evening, the court issued a warrant to police to detain the men. Despite this, Mr Duda invited both to Warsaw's Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning to attend a ceremony to swear in two of their former colleagues as presidential advisers. Several hours later, they emerged from the palace to speak briefly to reporters, all the while remaining inside its grounds. Mr Kaminski said they will be ""political prisoners"" if they are arrested and thanked Mr Duda for his support. ""We are dealing with a very serious state crisis. A grim dictatorship is being created,"" Mr Kaminski said. They then returned inside the palace as the political theatre unfolded. Moments later, Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference the situation was ""unbelievable"". He said the court's ruling must be respected and suggested President Duda was helping the men evade justice. ""There is no rulebook for the prime minister or interior minister on how to act when convicts are in the Presidential Palace. This is clearly taking advantage of a situation in which no one will use force against such an institution as the president,"" he added. Following the arrests, several hundred PiS supporters demonstrated outside the palace in support of the men. On Wednesday morning, Mariusz Kaminski announced he was going on hunger strike, ""as a political prisoner, from the first day of my imprisonment"". Hunger strikes are not an uncommon form of protest in Poland, and they do not necessarily mean a refusal to accept all food and liquids. The deputy justice minister stressed that neither of the men was a political prisoner but any prisoner had the right to refuse food or drink if they wished. Last year, the Polish Supreme Court ruled Mr Duda's 2015 pardon was invalid because it was issued while the men were appealing against their conviction, ie before the original conviction was final. Mr Duda disputes that and insists the pardon is still binding. To complicate matters, the Constitutional Tribunal and a new Supreme Court chamber, both of which are staffed by judges nominated by PiS, have ruled in favour of Mr Duda. Mr Tusk said Mr Duda could resolve the stand-off by pardoning the men again, now that the ruling is final. But that would call into question the legal status of the initial pardon. Mr Tusk's coalition took office last month pledging to undo PiS's changes to the judiciary, public media, and civil service that the European Commission and many other international bodies say have undermined the rule of law in Poland. One of its first acts was to reform the state TV, radio and news agency that PiS had transformed into a propaganda mouthpiece for its government. But its methods were similar to PiS's, first using a government minister to sack media boards and install new people ahead of planned legislative reform. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights acknowledged PiS had made it legally difficult to reform the public media, which it said required ""urgent reform"" because it had become ""a propaganda mouthpiece"" under PiS, but said the new government's changes ""raise serious doubts"". Former PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC Mr Tusk's government talked loudly about democratic standards but fell well short in practice. ""We are witnessing an unprecedented attack on the rule of law. Tusk's government decided it could take over public television and media by force. This has nothing to do with democratic standards. We have not seen such brutal government action since communism. It is all the more outrageous that this is done by people who have such slogans of democracy on their lips,"" Mr Morawiecki said. Given PiS's record of controlling state institutions while in office, many Tusk supporters argue such accusations are the height of hypocrisy.","['Poland', 'Donald Tusk', 'Andrzej Duda']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E520/production/_132265685_gettyimages-1913161993.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18160/production/_132265689_19efb1ef4e034cc335fb503941d8c937f1703af10_0_5917_33291000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/38D2/production/_132264541_a5e45657503cb0e8410607c7227b38f679cb974c.jpg']","['By Adam Easton', 'BBC News, Warsaw']",World,Europe

Up to 200 cattle, calves and horses were stranded on Krcedin island northwest of the capital Belgrade, after water levels swelled last week, blocking their passage back to shore. Evacuation efforts began on Tuesday, when some 60 animals were saved. Rescuers are now under pressure to save the rest as freezing temperatures and fears of starvation set in. The Danube snakes its way for 2,900km (1,800 miles) through 10 European countries from Germany's Black Forest via Serbia to the Black Sea. The island, Krcedinska Ada, is situated on its left bank, 3km from the shore and around 50km up river from Belgrade. Unseasonably mild weather in the Balkan region in late 2023 led to melting snow that caused water levels to rise sharply. But this week, the balmy weather gave way to snowfall and freezing temperatures, raising fears for the animals' survival. For days, farmers appealed to have their livestock rescued from the island as conditions worsened. On Tuesday, rescue teams deployed by the Serbian military, the emergencies department, the forestry agency and local citizens arrived with a raft to transfer the animals. Two loads of around 30 animals each were transported safely to shore, but further attempts were stalled due to a series of problems. The first raft had to be replaced due to missing railings, BBC Serbian reported. Then after just two runs its replacement broke down. Environmental group Eko Straza (Eco Guard) added that the cattle were exhausted and had lost as much as 50kg of their weight. Serbian news agency Tanjug said a new boat was then hired for the rescue to resume on Wednesday. Difficulties also arose in transporting dozens of wild horses, which are not used to human contact except for people bringing them food. Experts said that would likely be the greatest task of the operation. Speed has now become of utmost importance, because of the freezing conditions and increasing hunger. Cattle breeder Milenko Plavsic said some of his animals had already died and that the lives of those remaining were at risk. Some had also run away, he said. For days he has been warning that his cattle could die because the high water levels have meant they have been unable to graze. In a normal year, Mr Plavsic explained that the animals would return home by wading for 10km through shallow waters.",['Serbia'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/107F8/production/_132267576_gettyimages-1912881908.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17D28/production/_132267579_gettyimages-1912863457.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4890/production/_132267581_gettyimages-1912861138.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1102C/production/_132267696_gettyimages-1912883387.jpg']","['By Emily Atkinson', 'BBC News']",World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67938285,Streets empty as Ecuador reels from violence,Soldiers are on the streets in several cities in Ecuador as the country reels from an unprecedented day of violence.,2024-01-10,"Soldiers are on the streets in several cities in Ecuador as the country reels from an unprecedented day of violence. Masked gunmen stormed a public TV studio during a live broadcast in the city of Guayaquil and bombs were detonated across Ecuador on Tuesday. More than 130 prison staff are being held hostage by inmates in five jails. A 60-day state of emergency began on Monday after a notorious gangster vanished from his prison cell. It is unclear whether the attack on the TV studio in Ecuador's largest city was related to the disappearance of the boss of the Choneros gang, Adolfo Macías Villamar, or Fito, as he is better known. President Daniel Noboa declared the state of emergency in response to a wave of recent jail riots and escapes from prisons and other acts of violence blamed by authorities on criminal gangs. He ordered that criminal gangs be ""neutralised"" and said that an ""internal armed conflict"" existed within the country. The government says the violence is a reaction to President Noboa's plan to build a new high security prison for gang leaders. The president said on Wednesday that Ecuador would begin to deport foreign prisoners, especially Colombians, to reduce the number of inmates. Esteban Torres Cobo, a vice minister in President Noboa's government, said the war on armed gangs could result in many deaths and casualties. ""It's going to be bloody but this is the change we need in order to have a better future, we cannot be postponing this decision throughout the years, we have to take decision now,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. He said gang leaders were asking for mediation but that the ""government is not going to negotiate with no-one."" A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very much alarmed by the deteriorating situation"" and the ""disruptive impact on the lives of Ecuadorans"". Meanwhile, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the US ""strongly condemned"" the recent attacks, while National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Washington was committed to ""helping support security and prosperity for the people of Ecuador"". Hours after the most brazen of the attacks, Guayaquil was like a city waking up from a strange nightmare. Despite the deteriorating security situation over recent years, few could have expected to see the anchor of state television channel TC with a gun pointed at his head, live on air. Police have made 70 arrests since Monday, including in response to the storming of the TV station. The ripple effect of that brazen attack has been to send people for cover, even a day later. The streets are largely empty for a weekday. Many say the situation reminds them of life during the Covid pandemic. Hundreds of soldiers, including in tanks, are patrolling the streets of Guayaquil and the capital, Quito. Across the country, schools have remained closed, with lessons taking place online. China, a major investor in Ecuador, also announced it was temporarily shutting its embassy and consulates. Inside the businesses which remain open in Guayaquil, jumpy private security guards are keeping the doors closed, only allowing people in with caution. Eduardo, who works for an international clothing firm, said he was in the street buying coffee at the moment the chaos started to unfold and by the time he returned to the office, his colleagues had already started to pack up and leave. ""Today, everyone is working from home,"" he said. Some 125 prison guards and 14 administrative staff are being held hostage across Ecuador, the SNAI prisons agency says. Four police officers, who authorities say were kidnapped by criminals between Monday and Tuesday, are also being held. Three other officers were freed late on Tuesday. Police say violence is ongoing in Guayaquil. Eight people were killed and three injured in attacks linked to criminal gangs in the city on Tuesday while two police officers were killed by ""armed criminals"" in the nearby town of Nobol, police said. Police say they are in the process of identifying three bodies which were found in a burned-out car in the south of the city overnight. This is an unprecedented situation for the people of Guayaquil - they have seen political protests and other violent incidents over the years but nothing on the scale of the sheer panic which gripped the city on Tuesday. Students ran in fear as gunmen entered their university corridors and bombs were detonated around the country, raising fears that the attacks were co-ordinated. Those who must venture out, for work or to visit family, are doing so with great trepidation. It has been an exhausting, upsetting 24 hours in Ecuador's main port. In recent years, Ecuador's prisons have been plagued by violent feuds between jailed members of rival gangs, often resulting in multiple massacres of inmates. President Noboa's emergency declaration listed the Choneros (named after the town of Chone in Manabi Province) as well as 21 other gangs as behind the recent spate of violence. The order built on the state of emergency declared on Monday, which ordains a nightly curfew in an attempt to curb violence following Fito's escape. Security forces have been trying to re-establish order in at least six jails where riots broke out on Monday. The escape of Fito represents a huge blow to Mr Noboa's presidency, barely seven weeks old. President Noboa, at the age of 36, became Ecuador's youngest leader to be democratically elected, winning an election tarnished by the assassination of presidential candidate and journalist Fernando Villavicencio. Villavicencio had reported receiving death threats from Fito just days before he was shot dead while leaving a campaign rally in Quito.","['Quito', 'Ecuador']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5B79/production/_132271432_guayaquil.png'],"['By James Gregory & Will Grant', 'BBC News in London and Guayaquil']",World,Latin America

Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, has ordered the armed forces to restore order in the country after days of unrest which saw two gang leaders escape from jail, prison guards held hostage, and explosive devices set off in a number of cities across the country. In the most dramatic attack, a group of armed men forced their way into the studios of TC Television in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, and tried to force one of the presenters to read out a message live on air. The gunmen were eventually overpowered by soldiers and have been arrested but the live footage of the stand-off between the hooded men and the armed forces while TC staff cowered on the floor has terrified Ecuadoreans. The most recent surge in violence kicked off on 7 January when police moved into La Regional, a prison in the port city of Guayaquil, where notorious gang leader Adolfo Macías Villamar, better known as ""Fito"", was being held. The plan had been to transfer Fito to La Roca, a smaller prison within the same compound, which is considered safer as it holds fewer inmates. But when police entered Fito's cell, they found it empty. A government spokesman said that Fito had been tipped off about his impending transfer as early as Christmas, and had escaped before he could be moved. It is not clear when exactly he absconded or how, but two prison guards have been charged with helping him escape. News of his escape triggered riots in at least six jails across the country, with a number of prison guards taken hostage. Many of the prison wings housing Ecuador's most notorious gang members are controlled not by the state, the guards or the security forces, but by the inmates themselves. Individual cells can be rented from the inmates running the wing, and food, drink and drugs which are smuggled into the jail can also be bought from those in charge. A music video recorded by Fito's daughter in September includes footage showing her father in the prison courtyard and gives an idea of why he would not want to leave La Regional. It shows him petting his fighting cockerel and also relaxing with fellow prisoners. His cell is spacious and decorated with garish murals and boasts its own shower cubicle. Fito leads Los Choneros, one of Ecuador's most powerful prison gangs. But there are other prison gangs which control other penitentiaries. In some prisons, individual wings are controlled by rival gangs with the warring sides sometimes only separated by barbed wire. Any shift in the power balance between the gangs - or even a gang-internal power struggle - can turn deadly in this confined and overcrowded space. This became clear when the 2020 assassination of the previous leader of Los Choneros, Jorge Luis Zambrano, led to a split in the gang, with its off-shoots soon turning into mortal enemies of their former comrades. On 21 February 2021, simultaneous fights erupted in four jails between the rival factions - 79 inmates were killed. While the number of dead was shocking at the time, it was surpassed later that year when 123 prisoners were murdered in a gang fight in Litoral prison, which is part of the same compound in Guayaquil from which Fito escaped. In an interview Fito gave to Ecuadorean journalists Andersson Boscán and Mónica Velásquez in 2021 for their series Paz o Plomo (Spanish for Peace or Lead), the gang leader warned that any attempts to move him or other gang leaders to La Roca would trigger a ""sudden death"" scenario in which ""there will be riots at all prisons"". Ecuador is sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, the two largest producers of cocaine in the world. According to the United Nations Global Report on Cocaine 2023, cocaine production recently reached a record high. The security forces in Colombia, in particular, have spent decades trying to stem the flow of cocaine and its police force has received training and support from the United States. But just as police forces have pooled resources in order to disrupt the flow of cocaine, the gangs doing the trafficking have also become more international. Mexican drug cartels and criminal groups from the Balkans gained a foothold in South America after the Farc rebel group, which used to control many of the smuggling routes in Colombia, demobilised as part of a peace deal signed in 2016. These transnational crime groups were keen to explore new ways to transport the cocaine produced in Colombia to buyers in Europe and the United States. And Ecuador with its large ports on the Pacific coast and limited experiences in dealing with crime gangs soon became an attractive transit country for their drug shipments. President Daniel Noboa declared a 60-day state of emergency on Monday and a nationwide curfew from 23:00-05:00 every night. The state of emergency allows the president to send soldiers into prisons to restore order and he can also deploy them across the country to help police with their tasks. Police can stop people in the streets to search them for weapons and also have the power to carry out searches in people's homes if they suspect arms or explosives are hidden inside. The state of emergency prompted an immediate backlash from the gangs. One of the police officers kidnapped while on duty was forced to read out a videotaped statement warning the president that ""you declared war, you will get war"". ""You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war,"" the statement continues. On Tuesday as the storming of the TV studio in Guayaquil unfolded, the president went a step further and declared an ""armed internal conflict"". He also ordered the armed forces to ""neutralise"" the gangs behind the violence. He also published a list of 22 gangs which he said would now be considered ""terrorist organisations"". The head of the armed forces also stressed that there would ""no negotiations"" with the gangs who were causing the violence. How he will confront the prison violence which has now spilled over into the streets of Ecuador's main cities is a huge test for Mr Noboa, who has only been in office two months. The 36-year-old was elected in the wake of the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio in August on a promise to combat the gangs which are thought to have been behind Villavicencio's murder. But five months after that shocking event, many Ecuadoreans are again scared to leave their homes as the violence from its prisons has spilled into the streets of major cities.","['Prisons', 'Ecuador', 'Peru', 'Drugs trade', 'Gangs']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1A88/production/_132229760_971a6d2a4dabd851b7f3777ffa4433daad6022f30_0_5500_36681000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2E0/production/_132229754_e1df984390b4288f72f57d2e93d2c8d56f5c03e90_0_3801_21391000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/DF08/production/_132269075_ecuador_locater_2x640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6A3C/production/_132269172_3b08e9d1fc18242b806ebb2805183e24619439f80_0_5500_36681000x667.jpg']","['By Vanessa Buschschlüter', 'BBC News Online Latin America editor']",World,Latin America

The Mexican star had suffered from appendiceal cancer, his publicist said. Canto was the national security adviser in Designated Survivor alongside Kiefer Sutherland, who paid tribute to the actor as ""such a wonderful spirit"". In the 2014 X-Men film, Canto played mutant Sunspot, and co-star Halle Berry later cast him in her movie Bruised. The actress and director wrote on Instagram: ""I don't have the words just yet… but my dear sweet friend Adan just gained his wings. Forever, forever in my heart."" Canto's wife Stephanie Ann posted a photo of the couple, a Bible passage and the words: ""Forever my treasure Adan, see you soon."" In a statement, his publicist Jennifer Allen said: ""Adan had a depth of spirit that few truly knew. Those who glimpsed it were changed forever. He will be greatly missed by so many."" In his message, Sutherland added: ""As an actor his desire to do well, to be great, and then do better, was truly impressive and he will be greatly missed. I am also heartbroken for his wife, Steph and his two young children. Adan, may you rest in peace."" Canto played Aaron Shore in Designated Survivor, which aired on the ABC network in 2016 and 17 before being picked up by Netflix for a third and final season. Co-star Maggie Q wrote: ""Beautiful friend… You are the level of person that Hollywood didn't even deserve. Kindness and warmth and generosity of spirit - total dedication to your family, and ALWAYS doing the right thing. No one had your moral compass nor did they even come close. ""I don't understand this. Anyone who knew you was a lucky one. That's all I do know."" Italia Ricci, another Designated Survivor castmate, wrote that she was ""completely lost for words"". ""He was the strongest person I know in every sense of the word and I am so angry that this happened. No-one deserved this less than this sweet, brilliant, kind, and gentle man... ""I'm so sorry for everyone hurting at this devastating loss and am beyond heartbroken for his family. You'll be in my heart always."" Canto went on to star as gangster Arman Morales in Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady in 2022. ""He'll always be our Arman,"" Fox posted on X. ""Adan Canto, your memory will be cherished forever."" In a joint statement, Fox and Warner Bros Television described him as ""a wonderful actor and dear friend"". ""Most recently, he lit up the screen in The Cleaning Lady with a powerful performance that showcased his artistry, range, depth and vulnerability,"" the broadcasters said. ""This is an unfathomable loss, and we grieve alongside his wife Stephanie, their children and loved ones. We will miss Adan dearly."" Canto made his breakthrough in the US in Fox thriller The Following with Kevin Bacon in 2013, and appeared in ABC sitcom Mixology and drama Blood & Oil. He also appeared as Colombian politician Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in Netflix's Narcos, and his film credits included spy thriller Agent Game in 2022.","['Television', 'Film']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1227E/production/_132266347_gettyimages-1246511877.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FB6E/production/_132266346_gettyimages-613828510.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D45E/production/_132266345_gettyimages-492292581.jpg']","['By Ian Youngs', 'Entertainment & arts reporter']",World,Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67938285,Streets empty as Ecuador reels from violence,Soldiers are on the streets in several cities in Ecuador as the country reels from an unprecedented day of violence.,2024-01-10,"Soldiers are on the streets in several cities in Ecuador as the country reels from an unprecedented day of violence. Masked gunmen stormed a public TV studio during a live broadcast in the city of Guayaquil and bombs were detonated across Ecuador on Tuesday. More than 130 prison staff are being held hostage by inmates in five jails. A 60-day state of emergency began on Monday after a notorious gangster vanished from his prison cell. It is unclear whether the attack on the TV studio in Ecuador's largest city was related to the disappearance of the boss of the Choneros gang, Adolfo Macías Villamar, or Fito, as he is better known. President Daniel Noboa declared the state of emergency in response to a wave of recent jail riots and escapes from prisons and other acts of violence blamed by authorities on criminal gangs. He ordered that criminal gangs be ""neutralised"" and said that an ""internal armed conflict"" existed within the country. The government says the violence is a reaction to President Noboa's plan to build a new high security prison for gang leaders. The president said on Wednesday that Ecuador would begin to deport foreign prisoners, especially Colombians, to reduce the number of inmates. Esteban Torres Cobo, a vice minister in President Noboa's government, said the war on armed gangs could result in many deaths and casualties. ""It's going to be bloody but this is the change we need in order to have a better future, we cannot be postponing this decision throughout the years, we have to take decision now,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. He said gang leaders were asking for mediation but that the ""government is not going to negotiate with no-one."" A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very much alarmed by the deteriorating situation"" and the ""disruptive impact on the lives of Ecuadorans"". Meanwhile, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the US ""strongly condemned"" the recent attacks, while National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Washington was committed to ""helping support security and prosperity for the people of Ecuador"". Hours after the most brazen of the attacks, Guayaquil was like a city waking up from a strange nightmare. Despite the deteriorating security situation over recent years, few could have expected to see the anchor of state television channel TC with a gun pointed at his head, live on air. Police have made 70 arrests since Monday, including in response to the storming of the TV station. The ripple effect of that brazen attack has been to send people for cover, even a day later. The streets are largely empty for a weekday. Many say the situation reminds them of life during the Covid pandemic. Hundreds of soldiers, including in tanks, are patrolling the streets of Guayaquil and the capital, Quito. Across the country, schools have remained closed, with lessons taking place online. China, a major investor in Ecuador, also announced it was temporarily shutting its embassy and consulates. Inside the businesses which remain open in Guayaquil, jumpy private security guards are keeping the doors closed, only allowing people in with caution. Eduardo, who works for an international clothing firm, said he was in the street buying coffee at the moment the chaos started to unfold and by the time he returned to the office, his colleagues had already started to pack up and leave. ""Today, everyone is working from home,"" he said. Some 125 prison guards and 14 administrative staff are being held hostage across Ecuador, the SNAI prisons agency says. Four police officers, who authorities say were kidnapped by criminals between Monday and Tuesday, are also being held. Three other officers were freed late on Tuesday. Police say violence is ongoing in Guayaquil. Eight people were killed and three injured in attacks linked to criminal gangs in the city on Tuesday while two police officers were killed by ""armed criminals"" in the nearby town of Nobol, police said. Police say they are in the process of identifying three bodies which were found in a burned-out car in the south of the city overnight. This is an unprecedented situation for the people of Guayaquil - they have seen political protests and other violent incidents over the years but nothing on the scale of the sheer panic which gripped the city on Tuesday. Students ran in fear as gunmen entered their university corridors and bombs were detonated around the country, raising fears that the attacks were co-ordinated. Those who must venture out, for work or to visit family, are doing so with great trepidation. It has been an exhausting, upsetting 24 hours in Ecuador's main port. In recent years, Ecuador's prisons have been plagued by violent feuds between jailed members of rival gangs, often resulting in multiple massacres of inmates. President Noboa's emergency declaration listed the Choneros (named after the town of Chone in Manabi Province) as well as 21 other gangs as behind the recent spate of violence. The order built on the state of emergency declared on Monday, which ordains a nightly curfew in an attempt to curb violence following Fito's escape. Security forces have been trying to re-establish order in at least six jails where riots broke out on Monday. The escape of Fito represents a huge blow to Mr Noboa's presidency, barely seven weeks old. President Noboa, at the age of 36, became Ecuador's youngest leader to be democratically elected, winning an election tarnished by the assassination of presidential candidate and journalist Fernando Villavicencio. Villavicencio had reported receiving death threats from Fito just days before he was shot dead while leaving a campaign rally in Quito.","['Quito', 'Ecuador']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5B79/production/_132271432_guayaquil.png'],"['By James Gregory & Will Grant', 'BBC News in London and Guayaquil']",World,Latin America

The scenes which have unfolded in Ecuador show the extent to which this once peaceful haven in Latin America has descended into violence. Here, we take a closer look at how Ecuador became involved in what its president has declared an ""armed internal conflict"". Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, has ordered the armed forces to restore order in the country after days of unrest which saw two gang leaders escape from jail, prison guards held hostage, and explosive devices set off in a number of cities across the country.

Masked gunmen broke into public television channel TC's live studio during a broadcast, forcing staff to the floor. Police made 13 arrests following the attack, which injured two employees. At least 10 people have been killed since a 60-day state of emergency began in Ecuador on Monday. The emergency was declared after a notorious gangster vanished from his prison cell. It is unclear whether the incident at the TV studio in Guayaquil was related to the disappearance from a prison in the same city of the boss of the Choneros gang, Adolfo Macías Villamar, or Fito as he is better known. President Noboa said on Tuesday that an ""internal armed conflict"" now existed in the country and he was mobilising the armed forces to carry out ""military operations to neutralise"" what he called ""transnational organised crime, terrorist organisations and belligerent non-state actors"". In neighbouring Peru, the government ordered the immediate deployment of a police force to the border to prevent any instability spilling over into the country. The US has said it condemns the ""brazen attacks"" in Ecuador and is ""co-ordinating closely"" with President Daniel Noboa and his Ecuadorean government and stands ""ready to provide assistance"". Ecuador is one of the world's top banana exporters, but also exports oil, coffee, cocoa, shrimps and fish products. A surge in violence in the Andean nation, inside and outside its prisons, has been linked to fighting between drug cartels, both foreign and local, over control of cocaine routes to the US and Europe. During Tuesday's assault at the TV station, one gunman pointed a pump-action shotgun at the head of one of the captives, who was also threatened with a revolver. A woman could be heard pleading, ""Don't shoot, please don't shoot,"" AFP news agency reports, while a person could be heard screaming in apparent pain. ""Please, they came in to kill us,"" a TC employee told AFP in a WhatsApp message. ""God don't let this happen. The criminals are on air."" One cameraman was shot in the leg, and another's arm was broken in the attack, the deputy director of news said. ""Through our earpieces the producers told us, 'Be careful, they are trying to enter, they are stealing, they are mugging us',"" Jorge Rendon told the Reuters news agency. ""The doors in the studio are very thick, almost bullet-proofed, and they were trying to get in because they wanted to gain access to the studio so we would say whatever they wanted us to say,"" he said. Posting video of the suspects arrested on social media - and their weapons - police said the perpetrators would be ""punished for terrorist acts"". President Noboa's emergency declaration responded to a wave of recent jail riots and escapes from prisons and other acts of violence blamed by authorities on criminal gangs.

In the city of Riobamba, nearly 40 inmates, including another convicted drug lord, broke out of a prison. At least seven police officers were also kidnapped and a video circulating on social media shows three of the kidnapped officers sitting on the ground with a gun pointed at them as one is forced to read a statement addressed to President Noboa, AFP reports. ""You declared war, you will get war,"" the officer reads out. ""You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war."" Police have ordered the evacuation of the government compound in Quito over security concerns. Quito residents told Reuters news agency the city was in chaos since news of the attack at the TV station in Guayaquil. ""There's too much nervousness in the city,"" said Mario Urena. ""At work, people are leaving earlier. All the people are leaving, you see a lot of traffic and alarms everywhere. There's a chaos."" Other people in the city of Cuenca told AFP of their shock at seeing the TV station seized. ""In Ecuador, we have never seen this kind of thing, where a channel has been practically hijacked and a broadcast starts with shootings, with kidnappings,"" said Francisco Rosas. ""So what kind of security situation are we in? And if a television station is capable of receiving this type of robbery, this type of insecurity, imagine restaurants or shops."" In recent years, the country's prisons have been plagued by violent feuds between jailed members of rival gangs, often resulting in multiple massacres of inmates.

His escape is also a blow to the government of President Noboa, who was sworn in in November after winning an election tarnished by the assassination of presidential candidate and journalist Fernando Villavicencio.

In an impeachment hearing on Wednesday they focused on how states have been affected by his department's actions. Impeaching a cabinet official is rare but the border is emerging as a key political issue that could dominate the 2024 presidential election. A growing number of Americans consider migration across the border a crisis. In December, a record number of migrants were processed at the southern border and for all of 2023 almost 2.5 million people were apprehended there. The Republican-dominated House Committee on Homeland Security has said Mr Mayorkas failed to enforce US laws at the border, which amounts to a ""dereliction of duty"". Committee chairman Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, said impeachment does not just cover criminal behaviour, but also ""gross incompetence"" that can be seen as endangering fellow Americans or betraying public trust. Mississippi's Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said this is ""not a legitimate impeachment"" and suggested that Republicans were throwing ""political red meat to their base"" to keep ""campaign cash coming"". The hearing included testimony from attorneys general from Montana, Oklahoma and Missouri - states led by Republican governors -  who said they have dealt with impacts from his policies even though none of them neighbour Mexico. ""The southern border certainly presents a difficult challenge for any administration, but Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration have absolutely poured gasoline on this fire,"" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen testified. House Speaker Mike Johnson recently led a delegation of Republicans to the border, where they got a ""first-hand look at the damage and chaos the border catastrophe is causing in all of our communities"". Mr Mayorkas also made a trip, one day before the impeachment hearing, where he put the blame on Congress, calling for it to fix immigration policies. He said the accusation that he does not uphold US immigration laws ""could not be further from the truth"" and in a memo his department said that Republicans were making ""baseless and pointless political attacks"" instead of fixing ""broken immigration laws"". Currently, Mr Mayorkas is working with the White House and a bipartisan group of senators to tighten those laws, which Republicans have demanded in exchange for agreeing to President Joe Biden's request for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Meanwhile, immigration has become one of the biggest hurdles facing President Biden's push for re-election. A CBS News poll, released this week, found that 63% of Americans want stricter border policies and 45% of Americans now say there is a crisis at the border. And several Democratic mayors have expressed alarm at the rising number of migrants arriving in their cities, partly due to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's policy of busing new arrivals out of his state. New York Mayor Eric Adams has previously warned the issue could ""destroy"" his city, pointing to a projection that housing the influx of migrants could cost taxpayers $12bn over the next three years. But Democratic lawmakers also say Republicans' move to remove Mr Mayorkas are politically motivated, with New York Congressman Dan Goldman calling them an ""embarrassment to the impeachment clause of the Constitution"". Even if convicted in the Republican-controlled House, it is unlikely the Democrat-controlled Senate would find Mr Mayorkas guilty of any crimes. Still, if he were impeached by the House, he would be the first cabinet official in nearly 150 years to go through the process.","['Immigration', 'Mexico–US border', 'United States']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0E17/production/_132270630_gettyimages-1918134998.jpg'],"['By Chloe Kim', 'BBC News']",World,Latin America

Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said. ""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor."" Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries. ""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged.""

Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them. The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.

If Israel is not excluded from the competition, they want public broadcaster Yle to withdraw Finland's entry from the competition. Yle has said it is monitoring the position of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), organiser of the contest. Last month, Icelandic musicians made similar demands to broadcaster Rúv. Lukas Korpelainen, one of the petition's authors, told newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet it was not acceptable for Israel to ""take part in the Eurovision Song Contest to polish its image"". Signatories include Finnish artists Olavi Uusivirta, Paleface and Axel Ehnström, who represented the country in the 2011 contest. The petition accuses broadcaster Yle of double standards, saying it was among the first to demand a ban on Russia from the 2022 contest, ""and we expect the same active defending of values from Yle now as well"". A day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Yle representative Ville Vilén said Moscow's attack was ""contrary to all the values that Yle and other European broadcasters represent"". The EBU soon after banned Russia from participating. Mr Vilén has said the situation in Israel and Gaza is ""not quite the same"". ""As gruesome as it is, it is not a war of inter-state aggression like between Russia and Ukraine,"" he told Finnish tabloid Ilta Sanomat a few weeks ago. Yle's head of communications Jere Nurminen told Hufvudstadsbladet the company was following the situation and talking to the EBU and other public broadcasters. Yle was also planning to meet the petition's authors, he added. In mid-December the EBU released a statement saying Eurovision was ""for broadcasters - not for governments"" and that Israel had taken part for 50 years. It said member organisations had agreed that Israel's public broadcaster ""complies with all competition rules"" and insisted the contest was a ""non-political event"". The BBC has approached Israel's culture ministry and public broadcaster Kan for comment. This year's Eurovision will take place in the Swedish city of Malmö, with the United Kingdom represented by pop star Olly Alexander. After it emerged that Alexander had endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide, an Israeli official told the UK's Telegraph newspaper the arguments were ""absurd"" and accused signatories of ""anti-Israel bias"". More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's military campaign - mostly women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The war was triggered after an attack by gunmen belonging to Hamas - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western governments - on southern Israel. About 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed, with about 240 others taken hostage. Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza before mounting a ground operation with the stated aim of ""destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"" as well as freeing the hostages. A total blockade of Gaza by the Israeli military has cut off supplies of food, medicines and fuel. UN agencies say 26% of Gazans - 576,600 people - have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face ""catastrophic hunger and starvation"". According to Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, 1.9 million Gazan residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced, and 1.4 million of them are sheltering in its facilities.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Iceland', 'Eurovision Song Contest', 'Finland', 'Israel']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/108D/production/_132273240_6fa22a2163b79eca476f9583a2aa1f2fba574217.jpg'],"['By Phelan Chatterjee', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night. The allies warned of ""consequences"" for such attacks. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Watch this space."" The Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel. The have repeatedly claimed - often falsely - that they are attacking merchant vessels linked to Israel in protest at Israeli actions during the war in Gaza. Tuesday's attack was the 26th on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November. The US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT). Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond. HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said. No injuries or damage were reported. Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving ""a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones"". ""It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel],"" he said. ""The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces,"" he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would ""not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation"". Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to ""prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very concerned"" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the ""risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East"". The UN Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution on Wednesday evening demanding the Houthis stop targeting maritime traffic in the Red Sea. Mr Shapps warned in a statement on Wednesday morning that the UK and its allies had ""previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"". ""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy,"" he added. Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was ""behind so much of the bad things happening in the region"" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be ""consequences"" if the attacks on shipping did not stop. Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: ""I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'."" He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"" last month to protect Red Sea shipping. They said the attacks posed ""a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways"". It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' ""watch this space"" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident. Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to ""telegraph"" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression. They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships. While he may have declined to go into details, our correspondent says it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine that the ""consequences"" and the ""response"" Mr Blinken discussed in Bahrain will not translate into a use of military force. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority. In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.","['Royal Navy', 'Shipping industry', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Grant Shapps', 'Global trade', 'Houthis', 'United States', 'Yemen']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86A2/production/_132266443_redsea.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AF38/production/_132265844_4d44a6007b89d7deb75cbca44da7cf0d478c148c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/89B8/production/_132065253_thumbnail_bab_al_mandab_strait_2x640-nc.png']","['By David Gritten', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: ""The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there."" Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them. On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been ""forced to withdraw and cease activities"" as a result of what they called ""increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital"". The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had ""received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave"". He stated that al-Aqsa was ""the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"". ""Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage,"" he warned. Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday. ""I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)."" He added: ""We were told we had to leave."" Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves. The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was ""not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question"". Another doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days. ""It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away,"" he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard. Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details. And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead. The BBC has asked the IDF for comment. The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing. Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a ""dangerous combat zone"" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital. The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves. Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone. The IDF said ""no specific evacuation notice had been given to"" al-Aqsa. Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed. Dr Smith said: ""Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital. ""Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday."" He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital. ""There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital."" Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital. The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed ""horrific"" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital. ""We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash,"" Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. ""We just had to use alcohol gel before operating."" ""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean. ""Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching,"" he added. Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: ""There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold. ""Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity."" She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief. ""I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said. ""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor."" Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries. ""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged."" The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that ""intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea"" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas. ""The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza,"" it warned. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them. The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Palestinian territories', 'Hamas', 'Israel']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147FE/production/_132266938_baby.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8134/production/_132267033_gaza_basic_al_aqsa_hospital-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0C04/production/_132267030_notes2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3A76/production/_132266941_blood2.jpg']","['By Alys Davies', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67932725,US and UK hint at military action after largest Houthi attack in Red Sea,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping.",2024-01-10,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping. Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night. The allies warned of ""consequences"" for such attacks. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Watch this space."" The Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel. The have repeatedly claimed - often falsely - that they are attacking merchant vessels linked to Israel in protest at Israeli actions during the war in Gaza. Tuesday's attack was the 26th on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November. The US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT). Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond. HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said. No injuries or damage were reported. Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving ""a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones"". ""It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel],"" he said. ""The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces,"" he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would ""not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation"". Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to ""prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very concerned"" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the ""risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East"". The UN Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution on Wednesday evening demanding the Houthis stop targeting maritime traffic in the Red Sea. Mr Shapps warned in a statement on Wednesday morning that the UK and its allies had ""previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"". ""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy,"" he added. Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was ""behind so much of the bad things happening in the region"" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be ""consequences"" if the attacks on shipping did not stop. Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: ""I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'."" He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"" last month to protect Red Sea shipping. They said the attacks posed ""a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways"". It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' ""watch this space"" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident. Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to ""telegraph"" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression. They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships. While he may have declined to go into details, our correspondent says it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine that the ""consequences"" and the ""response"" Mr Blinken discussed in Bahrain will not translate into a use of military force. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority. In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.","['Royal Navy', 'Shipping industry', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Grant Shapps', 'Global trade', 'Houthis', 'United States', 'Yemen']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86A2/production/_132266443_redsea.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AF38/production/_132265844_4d44a6007b89d7deb75cbca44da7cf0d478c148c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/89B8/production/_132065253_thumbnail_bab_al_mandab_strait_2x640-nc.png']","['By David Gritten', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel's military campaign - mostly women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The war was triggered after an attack by gunmen belonging to Hamas - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other Western governments - on southern Israel. About 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed, with about 240 others taken hostage. Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza before mounting a ground operation with the stated aim of ""destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"" as well as freeing the hostages. A total blockade of Gaza by the Israeli military has cut off supplies of food, medicines and fuel. UN agencies say 26% of Gazans - 576,600 people - have exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and face ""catastrophic hunger and starvation"". According to Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, 1.9 million Gazan residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced, and 1.4 million of them are sheltering in its facilities.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Iceland', 'Eurovision Song Contest', 'Finland', 'Israel']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/108D/production/_132273240_6fa22a2163b79eca476f9583a2aa1f2fba574217.jpg'],"['By Phelan Chatterjee', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67932725,US and UK hint at military action after largest Houthi attack in Red Sea,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping.",2024-01-10,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping. Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night. The allies warned of ""consequences"" for such attacks. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Watch this space."" The Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel. The have repeatedly claimed - often falsely - that they are attacking merchant vessels linked to Israel in protest at Israeli actions during the war in Gaza. Tuesday's attack was the 26th on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November. The US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT). Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond. HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said. No injuries or damage were reported. Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving ""a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones"". ""It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel],"" he said. ""The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces,"" he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would ""not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation"". Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to ""prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very concerned"" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the ""risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East"". The UN Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution on Wednesday evening demanding the Houthis stop targeting maritime traffic in the Red Sea. Mr Shapps warned in a statement on Wednesday morning that the UK and its allies had ""previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"". ""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy,"" he added. Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was ""behind so much of the bad things happening in the region"" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be ""consequences"" if the attacks on shipping did not stop. Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: ""I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'."" He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"" last month to protect Red Sea shipping. They said the attacks posed ""a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways"". It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' ""watch this space"" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident. Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to ""telegraph"" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression. They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships. While he may have declined to go into details, our correspondent says it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine that the ""consequences"" and the ""response"" Mr Blinken discussed in Bahrain will not translate into a use of military force. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority. In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.","['Royal Navy', 'Shipping industry', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Grant Shapps', 'Global trade', 'Houthis', 'United States', 'Yemen']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86A2/production/_132266443_redsea.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AF38/production/_132265844_4d44a6007b89d7deb75cbca44da7cf0d478c148c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/89B8/production/_132065253_thumbnail_bab_al_mandab_strait_2x640-nc.png']","['By David Gritten', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who has been working at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said the fighting meant there has been ""a real decrease"" in the number of staff able to work at the facility over the past two weeks. At the same time, she said some 600 to 700 patients were still being treated inside the hospital daily, and that hundreds of displaced people were sheltering there or in the immediate vicinity. ""Without any functioning or sufficient healthcare staff, it will be an unmitigated disaster for those people living in Middle Gaza,"" another member of the team, surgeon Nick Maynard, told the BBC. When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: ""The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there."" Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them. On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been ""forced to withdraw and cease activities"" as a result of what they called ""increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital"". The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had ""received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave"". He stated that al-Aqsa was ""the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"". ""Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage,"" he warned. Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday. ""I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)."" He added: ""We were told we had to leave."" Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves. The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was ""not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question"". Another doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days. ""It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away,"" he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard. Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details. And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead. The BBC has asked the IDF for comment. The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing. Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a ""dangerous combat zone"" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital. The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves. Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone. The IDF said ""no specific evacuation notice had been given to"" al-Aqsa. Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed. Dr Smith said: ""Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital. ""Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday."" He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital. ""There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital."" Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital. The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed ""horrific"" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital. ""We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash,"" Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. ""We just had to use alcohol gel before operating."" ""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean. ""Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching,"" he added. Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: ""There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold. ""Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity."" She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief. ""I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said. ""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor."" Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries. ""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged."" The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that ""intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea"" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas. ""The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza,"" it warned. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them. The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Palestinian territories', 'Hamas', 'Israel']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147FE/production/_132266938_baby.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8134/production/_132267033_gaza_basic_al_aqsa_hospital-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0C04/production/_132267030_notes2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3A76/production/_132266941_blood2.jpg']","['By Alys Davies', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-10,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations's top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. But last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South African Jewish leaders his government ""stands with the people of Palestine, who have endured over seven decades of apartheid-type… brutal occupation"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67916142,Bitcoin: Crypto fans can now invest in exchange-traded funds - but what are they?,The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds.,2024-01-10,"The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds. It has approved what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which can be purchased by anyone from pension funds to ordinary investors. The announcement from the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission was accompanied by a stern warning about risks associated with the asset. But cryptocurrency fans reacted with glee - and memes about becoming rich. The US financial watchdog had repeatedly rebuffed earlier requests for approvals, citing concerns about potential for fraud and manipulation. But a US court said last year its justification was inadequate. The go-ahead comes after a false start on Tuesday, when the regulator had to rapidly withdraw an ""unauthorised"" post announcing the decision early. SEC chairman Gary Gensler said on Monday that investors should not mistake the new approvals for an endorsement of the currency. ""Bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,"" he said. ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."" But what is an ETF? ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. An ETF could comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mixture of shares in both top technology and insurance companies. Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day. Why is there such excitement? About a dozen investment companies, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have been waiting for months for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give them the green light to start buying Bitcoin for their own ETFs. And after weeks of wrangling over wording, the first have now been given the nod. This means a new group of investors can now enter the speculative world of Bitcoin, without having to worry about getting digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Billions of dollars are expected to pour into the Bitcoin market, as these financial companies start buying the digital coin. A minority of analysts say the cryptocurrency's price will be little affected, as spot Bitcoin ETFs are already established in other countries. But with the US giants entering the market, most people are expecting the value of bitcoins to rise with demand. The price is notoriously volatile, however. It rose to nearly $70,000 (£55,000) a coin in 2021, before falling to $16,000 in 2022 as scandals shook the industry. But in 2023, it rose steadily, partly due to the hype around the Bitcoin ETF approval, and is now at $44,000. Based on an idea published online in 2008, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most valuable and famous. Its price is often seen as a barometer for the whole industry of thousands of other coins, tokens and products built on the same blockchain technology. And with an influx of new money into the ecosystem, many expect a surge in interest in cryptocurrency technology in general. How will the decision affect cryptocurrency adoption? Some say this landmark decision shows the establishment is finally taking Bitcoin seriously, at least as a speculative asset. For those who consider Bitcoin legitimate ""digital gold"", what better proof could there be than the biggest wealth-management institutions flocking to buy, overseen by regulators? Others say cryptocurrency is about rejecting traditional financial systems in favour of a decentralised, people-powered alternative. And investment bankers buying Bitcoin just to get rich on US dollars is not what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. But judging from the excitement on social media, the prevailing sentiment is hope the cash injection will make existing Bitcoin investors rich. What are the risks to future investors? The price of Bitcoin can change rapidly and often without warning or explanation. So investors will have to weigh that up when they opt for ETFs linked to the digital coin. But ETFs are often sold as high-risk, high-reward products anyway. Another potential risk is cyber-crime. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to huge and costly attacks that have seen crypto companies drained of sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars overnight. And if the likes of Blackrock become major holders of Bitcoin, their cyber-security will be tested in ways to which they are unaccustomed. Another downside is the cost to the environment. Bitcoin relies on a huge number of powerful computers around the world, to process transactions and create coins. Renewable energy use is growing - but it remains to be seen how investment companies can square the potential environmental cost of Bitcoin with buyers worried about environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) compliance.","['Cryptocurrency', 'Investment management', 'Bitcoin']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11EAB/production/_131278337_gettyimages-1436167319.jpg'],"['By Joe Tidy', 'Cyber correspondent']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67938594,Haley and DeSantis face-off in Iowa Republican debate,Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week.,2024-01-10,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week. The debate in Des Moines comes as both candidates lag far behind former President Donald Trump in the polls. The 15 January caucus will be the candidates' first electoral test in their effort to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2024. Mr Trump will not be in the debate, but will appear in a Fox News town hall. The former president has so far boycotted every Republican debate, a strategy that proved fruitful. He holds commanding poll leads in Iowa, sometimes up to 30 points, ahead of the state's caucuses. The CNN debate - which is slated for 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) - offers Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley, who stand in second and third place at the polls respectively, a final opportunity to make their case to caucus goers ahead of next week. Two other candidates, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, failed to qualify. The hours before the debate saw last-minute sparring between the two candidates over the airwaves, with a pro-Haley ad criticising Mr DeSantis for allegedly mischaracterising her comments on Gaza, immigration and Hillary Clinton. The ad was entitled ""DeSantis is lying because he's losing"". A super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis also released an ad in Iowa which attacked Ms Haley for saying that the upcoming New Hampshire primary - the second Republican contest - would ""correct"" the results of Iowa. ""Nikki Haley told New Hampshire what she really thinks about Iowa,"" the narrator says in the video. Mrs Haley was recently buoyed by fresh polling that suggests she has cut Mr Trump's lead in New Hampshire to single digits. Analysts have said a strong showing there could make her Republican party's prime alternative pick to the former president. Since serving as Mr Trump's ambassador to the UN during his time in the White House, she has broken with her one-time boss on key areas of foreign policy and criticised his willingness to do business with China. She has seemed to promise a return to a more traditional Republican party, embracing a hawkish foreign policy and faulting members of both parties, including Mr Trump, for running up the national debt. A former South Carolina governor, Mrs Haley has also argued that she is a more palatable candidate for undecided voters than Mr Trump. ""The only way we're going to win the majority of Americans is if we go forward with a new generational leader that leaves the negativity and the baggage in the past and goes forward with the solutions for the future,"" she told a town hall meeting in Iowa on Tuesday. But as her star has ascended in recent weeks, she has faced increased attacks from Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis. She also suffered a recent gaffe, as she failed to say that the Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery - which attracted criticism. By contrast, Mr DeSantis, the two term Florida governor, has sought to tack hard to Mr Trump's right. He has fought a campaign based broadly on culture wars issues and has touted his record of tackling what he called ""woke"" policies in his home state. While an early favourite as an alternative choice to Mr Trump, he has struggled to differentiate himself from his one-time ally. The former president raised Mr DeSantis from relative obscurity as a member of Congress and endorsed him in his run for the Florida governor's office in 2017. Bob Van Der Plaats - the leader of the influential Family Leader organisation - sought to assure Iowa voters that it was safe to support Mr DeSantis over Mr Trump in a Des Moines Register op-ed on Wednesday. ""Caucusing for Ron DeSantis is a good way to be a friend to Donald Trump,"" Mr Van Der Plaats wrote. He added that a ""DeSantis presidency ensures justice for Trump"" and that his preferred candidate is better equipped to fight government ""bureaucracy"" than the former president. It does appear Mr DeSantis is better suited to perform well in Iowa than Mrs Haley, where evangelical voters - a key voting block in the state - could be attracted to his staunch conservative values. Nevertheless, both candidates will likely have to exceed expectations to some degree to step out from under Mr Trump's looming shadow and keep their campaigns alive.","['Donald Trump', 'Republican Party', 'US election 2024', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Nikki Haley']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2217/production/_132272780_gettyimages-1836229967.jpg'],"['By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Matt Murphy', 'BBC News, in Des Moines, Iowa & Washington DC']",World,US & Canada

In an impeachment hearing on Wednesday they focused on how states have been affected by his department's actions. Impeaching a cabinet official is rare but the border is emerging as a key political issue that could dominate the 2024 presidential election. A growing number of Americans consider migration across the border a crisis. In December, a record number of migrants were processed at the southern border and for all of 2023 almost 2.5 million people were apprehended there. The Republican-dominated House Committee on Homeland Security has said Mr Mayorkas failed to enforce US laws at the border, which amounts to a ""dereliction of duty"". Committee chairman Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, said impeachment does not just cover criminal behaviour, but also ""gross incompetence"" that can be seen as endangering fellow Americans or betraying public trust. Mississippi's Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said this is ""not a legitimate impeachment"" and suggested that Republicans were throwing ""political red meat to their base"" to keep ""campaign cash coming"". The hearing included testimony from attorneys general from Montana, Oklahoma and Missouri - states led by Republican governors -  who said they have dealt with impacts from his policies even though none of them neighbour Mexico. ""The southern border certainly presents a difficult challenge for any administration, but Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration have absolutely poured gasoline on this fire,"" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen testified. House Speaker Mike Johnson recently led a delegation of Republicans to the border, where they got a ""first-hand look at the damage and chaos the border catastrophe is causing in all of our communities"". Mr Mayorkas also made a trip, one day before the impeachment hearing, where he put the blame on Congress, calling for it to fix immigration policies. He said the accusation that he does not uphold US immigration laws ""could not be further from the truth"" and in a memo his department said that Republicans were making ""baseless and pointless political attacks"" instead of fixing ""broken immigration laws"". Currently, Mr Mayorkas is working with the White House and a bipartisan group of senators to tighten those laws, which Republicans have demanded in exchange for agreeing to President Joe Biden's request for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Meanwhile, immigration has become one of the biggest hurdles facing President Biden's push for re-election. A CBS News poll, released this week, found that 63% of Americans want stricter border policies and 45% of Americans now say there is a crisis at the border. And several Democratic mayors have expressed alarm at the rising number of migrants arriving in their cities, partly due to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's policy of busing new arrivals out of his state. New York Mayor Eric Adams has previously warned the issue could ""destroy"" his city, pointing to a projection that housing the influx of migrants could cost taxpayers $12bn over the next three years. But Democratic lawmakers also say Republicans' move to remove Mr Mayorkas are politically motivated, with New York Congressman Dan Goldman calling them an ""embarrassment to the impeachment clause of the Constitution"". Even if convicted in the Republican-controlled House, it is unlikely the Democrat-controlled Senate would find Mr Mayorkas guilty of any crimes. Still, if he were impeached by the House, he would be the first cabinet official in nearly 150 years to go through the process.","['Immigration', 'Mexico–US border', 'United States']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0E17/production/_132270630_gettyimages-1918134998.jpg'],"['By Chloe Kim', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67938594,Haley and DeSantis face-off in Iowa Republican debate,Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week.,2024-01-10,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week. The debate in Des Moines comes as both candidates lag far behind former President Donald Trump in the polls. The 15 January caucus will be the candidates' first electoral test in their effort to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2024. Mr Trump will not be in the debate, but will appear in a Fox News town hall. The former president has so far boycotted every Republican debate, a strategy that proved fruitful. He holds commanding poll leads in Iowa, sometimes up to 30 points, ahead of the state's caucuses. The CNN debate - which is slated for 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) - offers Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley, who stand in second and third place at the polls respectively, a final opportunity to make their case to caucus goers ahead of next week. Two other candidates, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, failed to qualify. The hours before the debate saw last-minute sparring between the two candidates over the airwaves, with a pro-Haley ad criticising Mr DeSantis for allegedly mischaracterising her comments on Gaza, immigration and Hillary Clinton. The ad was entitled ""DeSantis is lying because he's losing"". A super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis also released an ad in Iowa which attacked Ms Haley for saying that the upcoming New Hampshire primary - the second Republican contest - would ""correct"" the results of Iowa. ""Nikki Haley told New Hampshire what she really thinks about Iowa,"" the narrator says in the video. Mrs Haley was recently buoyed by fresh polling that suggests she has cut Mr Trump's lead in New Hampshire to single digits. Analysts have said a strong showing there could make her Republican party's prime alternative pick to the former president. Since serving as Mr Trump's ambassador to the UN during his time in the White House, she has broken with her one-time boss on key areas of foreign policy and criticised his willingness to do business with China. She has seemed to promise a return to a more traditional Republican party, embracing a hawkish foreign policy and faulting members of both parties, including Mr Trump, for running up the national debt. A former South Carolina governor, Mrs Haley has also argued that she is a more palatable candidate for undecided voters than Mr Trump. ""The only way we're going to win the majority of Americans is if we go forward with a new generational leader that leaves the negativity and the baggage in the past and goes forward with the solutions for the future,"" she told a town hall meeting in Iowa on Tuesday. But as her star has ascended in recent weeks, she has faced increased attacks from Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis. She also suffered a recent gaffe, as she failed to say that the Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery - which attracted criticism. By contrast, Mr DeSantis, the two term Florida governor, has sought to tack hard to Mr Trump's right. He has fought a campaign based broadly on culture wars issues and has touted his record of tackling what he called ""woke"" policies in his home state. While an early favourite as an alternative choice to Mr Trump, he has struggled to differentiate himself from his one-time ally. The former president raised Mr DeSantis from relative obscurity as a member of Congress and endorsed him in his run for the Florida governor's office in 2017. Bob Van Der Plaats - the leader of the influential Family Leader organisation - sought to assure Iowa voters that it was safe to support Mr DeSantis over Mr Trump in a Des Moines Register op-ed on Wednesday. ""Caucusing for Ron DeSantis is a good way to be a friend to Donald Trump,"" Mr Van Der Plaats wrote. He added that a ""DeSantis presidency ensures justice for Trump"" and that his preferred candidate is better equipped to fight government ""bureaucracy"" than the former president. It does appear Mr DeSantis is better suited to perform well in Iowa than Mrs Haley, where evangelical voters - a key voting block in the state - could be attracted to his staunch conservative values. Nevertheless, both candidates will likely have to exceed expectations to some degree to step out from under Mr Trump's looming shadow and keep their campaigns alive.","['Donald Trump', 'Republican Party', 'US election 2024', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Nikki Haley']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2217/production/_132272780_gettyimages-1836229967.jpg'],"['By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Matt Murphy', 'BBC News, in Des Moines, Iowa & Washington DC']",World,US & Canada

They fought police after city officials and leaders of the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters came to close the tunnel. The men are charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and obstructing governmental administration. A spokesperson for the Chabad called them a ""group of extremist students"". The tunnels were built under a prominent street in Brooklyn, where the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters are located. The building is one of the most significant Jewish sites in the city. City inspectors were called to the Chabad on Monday to conduct an emergency structural inspection. There were looming concerns that the illegal tunnel could have caused damage to the famous property. A brawl broke out after police found a group of young men blocking efforts to inspect and fill the tunnel with cement. Some of the men then broke through the wall of the prayer space. Those acts led to the arrests. Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, the chairman of the Chabad, thanked police for their efforts and said the community was ""pained by the vandalism of a group of young agitators"". ""These odious actions will be investigated, and the sanctity of the synagogue will be restored,"" he said. It is unclear who built the tunnel, how they did it and what their motivations were. It appears the tunnel connects to at least one other building on the street in Brooklyn. One local told the New York Times that the men sought to build the tunnel to hasten the expansion of the synagogue. Some members who have attended services and functions at the Chabad have reportedly complained about overcrowding in the building in recent years. Videos and photos from inside the building on Monday, however, showed a small group of mostly young men trying to block the tunnel from being filled with cement. Others were seen pulling wood panels from the walls of the sanctuary and using benches to block police in the videos and images. One of the videos reviewed by the BBC showed an officer using a spray to break up a growing skirmish. The building, which sees thousands of visitors each year, was formerly the home of the leader of the Orthodox Jewish movement - Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The rabbi is credited with leading the Chabad-Lubavitch and revitalising the Hasidic religious community after it was devastated in the Holocaust. He died in 1994, but his headquarters remains a well-known centre for the Jewish religion. While the Chabad-Lubavitcher movement is sprawling and its mission is to welcome Jews at all levels of religious practice, it also has key divisions within the larger movement. Those divisions appeared to have spilled over in the tunnel dispute at 770 Eastern Parkway this month. A deeply religious fringe group within the Chabad believes Rabbi Schneerson is the Jewish Messiah - an idea the mainstream movement rejects. That disagreement is reportedly an element in the tunnel altercation. The building has been closed as inspection of the tunnels has continued.","['United States', 'Judaism', 'New York City']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C7AD/production/_132271115_gettyimages-1913161182.jpg'],"['By Phil McCausland', 'BBC News, New York']",World,US & Canada

The Oversight Committee was meeting to consider a resolution to hold the president's son in contempt for defying a House subpoena. Cameras blazed as he strode into the room with his attorney, Abbe Lowell. Republicans appeared angered by the move, with Rep Nancy Mace accusing him of ""white privilege"". ""I think that Hunter Biden should be arrested right here, right now, and go straight to jail,"" the South Carolina congresswoman said. ""Our nation is founded on the rule of law and the premise that the law applies equally to everyone, no matter what your last name is."" Democrats on the panel urged Republicans to allow Mr Biden, who sat in the audience, to be allowed to speak. But chair James Comer, who at times struggled to control the hearing, declined: ""Mr Biden doesn't make the rules, we make the rules."" Mr Biden exited Congress without speaking at the hearing a short time later. He exited the room as right-wing Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene began to speak. The Georgia representative, who has previously displayed nude images of Mr Biden during hearings, called him a ""coward"". Though he remained largely quiet as he left the Capitol, Mr Biden did answer one question. It centred on why he allegedly put his father on speakerphone in roughly 20 business meetings he held during Joe Biden's vice-presidency. ""If he called you, would you answer the phone?"" the president's son said. The Oversight Committee is planning to consider the contempt resolution later on Wednesday. Its passage through that body is the first step toward it being considered by the wider House. For Mr Biden to be held in contempt it would require a simple majority in the chamber, which Republicans hold by a slim two-seat margin. The 53-year-old's lawyer, Mr Lowell, who accompanied him, reprimanded Republicans for using Mr Biden as a ""surrogate to attack his father"", President Joe Biden. House Republicans have alleged that Mr Biden and his family unfairly profited from the elder Biden's longstanding political status in Washington. The White House and Hunter Biden have denied the allegations. Hunter Biden was subpoenaed to testify privately about his business dealings for the impeachment case against his father last year. In November, he told House Republicans that he was willing to testify to the Oversight Committee, but only if it was a public hearing. His counsel, Mr Lowell, said it would ""let the light shine"" on the proceedings. Republicans refused, and instead Mr Biden made a rare in-person statement outside the Capitol on the day he was to appear before Congress. He slammed Republicans, alleging they had ""distorted the facts"" and called for a public hearing. The younger Biden is also facing charges for possession of a gun while being an admitted drug addict and for lying on a federal form.","['Hunter Biden', 'Joe Biden', 'Republican Party']",,"['By Brandon Drenon', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

The Republican, who has run as a harsh critic of Donald Trump, lagged in opinion polls from the outset. Mr Christie had faced pressure to drop out as critics of frontrunner Mr Trump scramble to unify the party behind a viable alternative to the ex-president. This was Mr Christie's second unsuccessful White House campaign. He lost in 2016 to Mr Trump. Mr Christie announced that he was suspending his campaign at a town hall event in the US state of New Hampshire on Wednesday afternoon. In his opening remarks he took a swipe at Mr Trump, accusing him of ""putting himself before the people of this country"". ""Donald Trump wants you to be angry every day because he is angry,"" he added later in his address. It is not clear if he plans to endorse any of the few contenders still standing in the race to challenge Mr Trump for the Republican nomination. Mr Christie's planned exit comes days before the Iowa caucuses, the first of the state-by-state contests in which Republican voters will pick their preferred candidate for president. He launched his 2024 presidential campaign in June last year, and immediately began taking swings at Mr Trump. Mr Christie had hoped to act as attack dog for a field of Trump rivals who dared not cross the Republican base, which remains deeply loyal to the former president. This strategy resulted in some fireworks during the primary debates, but without Mr Trump on stage, Mr Christie failed to land any serious direct blows. Mr Christie has faced pressure from within an anti-Trump faction of the Republican party to drop out, thereby narrowing the field and allowing a challenger such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley to emerge from the pack. Ms Haley has been presenting a possible threat to Mr Trump in New Hampshire. The early-voting state has a large faction of unaffiliated voters, and has been known to deliver unpredictable results.

The slogan of Mr Christie's campaign was ""because the truth matters"". But opinion poll after poll showed that Republican primary voters did not want to hear Mr Christie's particular truth. ""Republican voters do not want to hear the same attacks that they've heard from Democrats or even the media for the better part of eight years,"" Mr Bartlett said. ""They just don't want to hear it.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67938005,House holds hearing on impeaching Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over US border,House Republicans are moving closer to impeaching Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the US-Mexico border.,2024-01-10,"House Republicans are moving closer to impeaching Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the US-Mexico border. In an impeachment hearing on Wednesday they focused on how states have been affected by his department's actions. Impeaching a cabinet official is rare but the border is emerging as a key political issue that could dominate the 2024 presidential election. A growing number of Americans consider migration across the border a crisis. In December, a record number of migrants were processed at the southern border and for all of 2023 almost 2.5 million people were apprehended there. The Republican-dominated House Committee on Homeland Security has said Mr Mayorkas failed to enforce US laws at the border, which amounts to a ""dereliction of duty"". Committee chairman Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, said impeachment does not just cover criminal behaviour, but also ""gross incompetence"" that can be seen as endangering fellow Americans or betraying public trust. Mississippi's Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said this is ""not a legitimate impeachment"" and suggested that Republicans were throwing ""political red meat to their base"" to keep ""campaign cash coming"". The hearing included testimony from attorneys general from Montana, Oklahoma and Missouri - states led by Republican governors -  who said they have dealt with impacts from his policies even though none of them neighbour Mexico. ""The southern border certainly presents a difficult challenge for any administration, but Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration have absolutely poured gasoline on this fire,"" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen testified. House Speaker Mike Johnson recently led a delegation of Republicans to the border, where they got a ""first-hand look at the damage and chaos the border catastrophe is causing in all of our communities"". Mr Mayorkas also made a trip, one day before the impeachment hearing, where he put the blame on Congress, calling for it to fix immigration policies. He said the accusation that he does not uphold US immigration laws ""could not be further from the truth"" and in a memo his department said that Republicans were making ""baseless and pointless political attacks"" instead of fixing ""broken immigration laws"". Currently, Mr Mayorkas is working with the White House and a bipartisan group of senators to tighten those laws, which Republicans have demanded in exchange for agreeing to President Joe Biden's request for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Meanwhile, immigration has become one of the biggest hurdles facing President Biden's push for re-election. A CBS News poll, released this week, found that 63% of Americans want stricter border policies and 45% of Americans now say there is a crisis at the border. And several Democratic mayors have expressed alarm at the rising number of migrants arriving in their cities, partly due to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's policy of busing new arrivals out of his state. New York Mayor Eric Adams has previously warned the issue could ""destroy"" his city, pointing to a projection that housing the influx of migrants could cost taxpayers $12bn over the next three years. But Democratic lawmakers also say Republicans' move to remove Mr Mayorkas are politically motivated, with New York Congressman Dan Goldman calling them an ""embarrassment to the impeachment clause of the Constitution"". Even if convicted in the Republican-controlled House, it is unlikely the Democrat-controlled Senate would find Mr Mayorkas guilty of any crimes. Still, if he were impeached by the House, he would be the first cabinet official in nearly 150 years to go through the process.","['Immigration', 'Mexico–US border', 'United States']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0E17/production/_132270630_gettyimages-1918134998.jpg'],"['By Chloe Kim', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67916142,Bitcoin: Crypto fans can now invest in exchange-traded funds - but what are they?,The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds.,2024-01-10,"The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds. It has approved what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which can be purchased by anyone from pension funds to ordinary investors. The announcement from the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission was accompanied by a stern warning about risks associated with the asset. But cryptocurrency fans reacted with glee - and memes about becoming rich. The US financial watchdog had repeatedly rebuffed earlier requests for approvals, citing concerns about potential for fraud and manipulation. But a US court said last year its justification was inadequate. The go-ahead comes after a false start on Tuesday, when the regulator had to rapidly withdraw an ""unauthorised"" post announcing the decision early. SEC chairman Gary Gensler said on Monday that investors should not mistake the new approvals for an endorsement of the currency. ""Bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,"" he said. ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."" But what is an ETF? ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. An ETF could comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mixture of shares in both top technology and insurance companies. Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day. Why is there such excitement? About a dozen investment companies, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have been waiting for months for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give them the green light to start buying Bitcoin for their own ETFs. And after weeks of wrangling over wording, the first have now been given the nod. This means a new group of investors can now enter the speculative world of Bitcoin, without having to worry about getting digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Billions of dollars are expected to pour into the Bitcoin market, as these financial companies start buying the digital coin. A minority of analysts say the cryptocurrency's price will be little affected, as spot Bitcoin ETFs are already established in other countries. But with the US giants entering the market, most people are expecting the value of bitcoins to rise with demand. The price is notoriously volatile, however. It rose to nearly $70,000 (£55,000) a coin in 2021, before falling to $16,000 in 2022 as scandals shook the industry. But in 2023, it rose steadily, partly due to the hype around the Bitcoin ETF approval, and is now at $44,000. Based on an idea published online in 2008, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most valuable and famous. Its price is often seen as a barometer for the whole industry of thousands of other coins, tokens and products built on the same blockchain technology. And with an influx of new money into the ecosystem, many expect a surge in interest in cryptocurrency technology in general. How will the decision affect cryptocurrency adoption? Some say this landmark decision shows the establishment is finally taking Bitcoin seriously, at least as a speculative asset. For those who consider Bitcoin legitimate ""digital gold"", what better proof could there be than the biggest wealth-management institutions flocking to buy, overseen by regulators? Others say cryptocurrency is about rejecting traditional financial systems in favour of a decentralised, people-powered alternative. And investment bankers buying Bitcoin just to get rich on US dollars is not what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. But judging from the excitement on social media, the prevailing sentiment is hope the cash injection will make existing Bitcoin investors rich. What are the risks to future investors? The price of Bitcoin can change rapidly and often without warning or explanation. So investors will have to weigh that up when they opt for ETFs linked to the digital coin. But ETFs are often sold as high-risk, high-reward products anyway. Another potential risk is cyber-crime. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to huge and costly attacks that have seen crypto companies drained of sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars overnight. And if the likes of Blackrock become major holders of Bitcoin, their cyber-security will be tested in ways to which they are unaccustomed. Another downside is the cost to the environment. Bitcoin relies on a huge number of powerful computers around the world, to process transactions and create coins. Renewable energy use is growing - but it remains to be seen how investment companies can square the potential environmental cost of Bitcoin with buyers worried about environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) compliance.","['Cryptocurrency', 'Investment management', 'Bitcoin']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11EAB/production/_131278337_gettyimages-1436167319.jpg'],"['By Joe Tidy', 'Cyber correspondent']",World,US & Canada

The Oversight Committee was meeting to consider a resolution to hold the president's son in contempt for defying a House subpoena. Cameras blazed as he strode into the room with his attorney, Abbe Lowell. Republicans appeared angered by the move, with Rep Nancy Mace accusing him of ""white privilege"". ""I think that Hunter Biden should be arrested right here, right now, and go straight to jail,"" the South Carolina congresswoman said. ""Our nation is founded on the rule of law and the premise that the law applies equally to everyone, no matter what your last name is."" Democrats on the panel urged Republicans to allow Mr Biden, who sat in the audience, to be allowed to speak. But chair James Comer, who at times struggled to control the hearing, declined: ""Mr Biden doesn't make the rules, we make the rules."" Mr Biden exited Congress without speaking at the hearing a short time later. He exited the room as right-wing Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene began to speak. The Georgia representative, who has previously displayed nude images of Mr Biden during hearings, called him a ""coward"". Though he remained largely quiet as he left the Capitol, Mr Biden did answer one question. It centred on why he allegedly put his father on speakerphone in roughly 20 business meetings he held during Joe Biden's vice-presidency. ""If he called you, would you answer the phone?"" the president's son said. The Oversight Committee is planning to consider the contempt resolution later on Wednesday. Its passage through that body is the first step toward it being considered by the wider House. For Mr Biden to be held in contempt it would require a simple majority in the chamber, which Republicans hold by a slim two-seat margin. The 53-year-old's lawyer, Mr Lowell, who accompanied him, reprimanded Republicans for using Mr Biden as a ""surrogate to attack his father"", President Joe Biden. House Republicans have alleged that Mr Biden and his family unfairly profited from the elder Biden's longstanding political status in Washington. The White House and Hunter Biden have denied the allegations. Hunter Biden was subpoenaed to testify privately about his business dealings for the impeachment case against his father last year. In November, he told House Republicans that he was willing to testify to the Oversight Committee, but only if it was a public hearing. His counsel, Mr Lowell, said it would ""let the light shine"" on the proceedings. Republicans refused, and instead Mr Biden made a rare in-person statement outside the Capitol on the day he was to appear before Congress. He slammed Republicans, alleging they had ""distorted the facts"" and called for a public hearing. The younger Biden is also facing charges for possession of a gun while being an admitted drug addict and for lying on a federal form.","['Hunter Biden', 'Joe Biden', 'Republican Party']",,"['By Brandon Drenon', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67938594,Haley and DeSantis face-off in Iowa Republican debate,Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week.,2024-01-10,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week. The debate in Des Moines comes as both candidates lag far behind former President Donald Trump in the polls. The 15 January caucus will be the candidates' first electoral test in their effort to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2024. Mr Trump will not be in the debate, but will appear in a Fox News town hall. The former president has so far boycotted every Republican debate, a strategy that proved fruitful. He holds commanding poll leads in Iowa, sometimes up to 30 points, ahead of the state's caucuses. The CNN debate - which is slated for 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) - offers Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley, who stand in second and third place at the polls respectively, a final opportunity to make their case to caucus goers ahead of next week. Two other candidates, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, failed to qualify. The hours before the debate saw last-minute sparring between the two candidates over the airwaves, with a pro-Haley ad criticising Mr DeSantis for allegedly mischaracterising her comments on Gaza, immigration and Hillary Clinton. The ad was entitled ""DeSantis is lying because he's losing"". A super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis also released an ad in Iowa which attacked Ms Haley for saying that the upcoming New Hampshire primary - the second Republican contest - would ""correct"" the results of Iowa. ""Nikki Haley told New Hampshire what she really thinks about Iowa,"" the narrator says in the video. Mrs Haley was recently buoyed by fresh polling that suggests she has cut Mr Trump's lead in New Hampshire to single digits. Analysts have said a strong showing there could make her Republican party's prime alternative pick to the former president. Since serving as Mr Trump's ambassador to the UN during his time in the White House, she has broken with her one-time boss on key areas of foreign policy and criticised his willingness to do business with China. She has seemed to promise a return to a more traditional Republican party, embracing a hawkish foreign policy and faulting members of both parties, including Mr Trump, for running up the national debt. A former South Carolina governor, Mrs Haley has also argued that she is a more palatable candidate for undecided voters than Mr Trump. ""The only way we're going to win the majority of Americans is if we go forward with a new generational leader that leaves the negativity and the baggage in the past and goes forward with the solutions for the future,"" she told a town hall meeting in Iowa on Tuesday. But as her star has ascended in recent weeks, she has faced increased attacks from Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis. She also suffered a recent gaffe, as she failed to say that the Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery - which attracted criticism. By contrast, Mr DeSantis, the two term Florida governor, has sought to tack hard to Mr Trump's right. He has fought a campaign based broadly on culture wars issues and has touted his record of tackling what he called ""woke"" policies in his home state. While an early favourite as an alternative choice to Mr Trump, he has struggled to differentiate himself from his one-time ally. The former president raised Mr DeSantis from relative obscurity as a member of Congress and endorsed him in his run for the Florida governor's office in 2017. Bob Van Der Plaats - the leader of the influential Family Leader organisation - sought to assure Iowa voters that it was safe to support Mr DeSantis over Mr Trump in a Des Moines Register op-ed on Wednesday. ""Caucusing for Ron DeSantis is a good way to be a friend to Donald Trump,"" Mr Van Der Plaats wrote. He added that a ""DeSantis presidency ensures justice for Trump"" and that his preferred candidate is better equipped to fight government ""bureaucracy"" than the former president. It does appear Mr DeSantis is better suited to perform well in Iowa than Mrs Haley, where evangelical voters - a key voting block in the state - could be attracted to his staunch conservative values. Nevertheless, both candidates will likely have to exceed expectations to some degree to step out from under Mr Trump's looming shadow and keep their campaigns alive.","['Donald Trump', 'Republican Party', 'US election 2024', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Nikki Haley']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2217/production/_132272780_gettyimages-1836229967.jpg'],"['By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Matt Murphy', 'BBC News, in Des Moines, Iowa & Washington DC']",World,US & Canada

Christopher Nolan's film has four nominations, while American Fiction, Barbie and Killers of the Flower Moon each have three. However, Leonardo DiCaprio is notably absent from the best actor category. The winners are voted for by Sag-Aftra's membership of more than 119,000 actors.

Bradley Cooper, Colman Domingo, Paul Giamatti, Cillian Murphy and Jeffrey Wright are all recognised. In the best actress race, three of the women considered favourites for an Oscar nomination - Emma Stone, Lily Gladstone and Carey Mulligan - are joined at SAG by Margot Robbie for Barbie and Annette Bening for Nyad. The SAG Awards offer a good indication of which actors could be nominated later this month for the Oscars. This year's Academy Awards take place on 10 March. In the TV categories, the most notable absence is Succession's Jeremy Strong - but his co-stars Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook, Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen are all nominated. Oppenheimer and Succession were the big winners at Sunday's Golden Globes, while Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers, Barbie and Poor Things won two prizes each.

Strong winds flipped cars and knocked over homes in Florida, where several tornadoes were reported. More than 1,300 flights in or out of the US were cancelled on Tuesday, according to data from FlightAware. Vice-President Kamala Harris' plane had to be diverted due to weather. A spokesperson for Mrs Harris said that ""inclement weather"" required her plane from Atlanta to land in Virginia rather than neighbouring Maryland on her way back to Washington DC. As of Tuesday evening, more than 630,000 households in the eastern US, from Florida to New York State were without electricity. Gov Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 49 Florida counties, where storms have blown roofs off homes and knocked down power lines. Twelve tornadoes were reported across Florida, Alabama and Georgia by early Tuesday, causing significant damage and, in some areas, prompting search and rescue operations. More than 22 million people were under tornado watches. In Houston County, Alabama, an 81-year-old woman was reportedly killed after a tornado ripped through the area, destroying mobile homes and RVs. One person was killed and two others were critically injured in Claremont, North Carolina, officials said, after a powerful storm moved through a mobile home park. A motorist died in Clayton County, Georgia, officials said, after a tree fell across a highway and crushed the driver's car. And one man was also crushed to death by a toppled tree in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday morning, the local station WVTM reported, citing local officials. A resident of Panama City, Florida, who lives across from a home that was toppled by the wind said it sounded like a ""freight train hitting a brick wall"". ""That's how loud it was,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The storms also left roadways impassable in Panama City, ripped roofs off of buildings and brought hail the size of baseballs. A curfew has been declared for the city's downtown area until 06:00EST (11:00GMT) on Wednesday morning. ""No one should be moving around in this area after dark,"" the Bay County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that more powerful storms are in store for the region and elsewhere in the eastern US. In New Jersey, a coastal flood advisory is in effect until Wednesday. The state's governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and warned residents not to ""underestimate"" the storm. In New York State, Governor Kathy Hochul warned the storm could be ""life threatening"", especially as the expected rainfall would combine with the snow already blanketing the ground, bringing about potential flash-flooding. Around 2,000 migrants living in a city tent shelter on an airfield in Brooklyn were evacuated by authorities to high school gymnasiums until the storms pass. A ground stop was briefly issued at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport - one of the country's busiest - due to excessive snow and ice, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.

Jayson Boebert was arrested in Colorado on charges including misdemeanour assault and criminal mischief. Police had been investigating the apparent altercation at Silt restaurant on Saturday but have not said whether the arrest is connected. Lauren and Jayson Boebert were divorced last year. Jail records seen by the BBC show Mr Boebert was arrested and subsequently released. He had been the one who called police following the restaurant incident and claimed he was a victim of domestic violence during the altercation, according to CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US. Mr Boebert had told the Denver Post he had no intention of pressing charges, and that he and his ex-wife ""were working through a difficult conversation"". Following news that police were investigating the incident earlier this week, Ms Boebert said: ""I didn't punch Jayson in the face and no-one was arrested."" In her statement released on Sunday prior to Mr Boebert's arrest, she added that she was consulting a lawyer about false claims being made against her. In September, Ms Boebert was escorted out of a theatre in Denver during a performance of the musical Beetlejuice, after being accused of disruptive behaviour. When apologising for that incident she referred to her ""difficult divorce"" as a reason for her conduct. ""I plead guilty to laughing and singing too loud!,"" Ms Boebert added on X, formerly Twitter, at the time. She is currently the Republican representative for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, so she sits in the lower chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives. Recently she announced she will run in 2024 in a different Colorado district. In her statement on Sunday she said the alleged restaurant incident was ""another reason I'm moving"".","['United States', 'Colorado', 'US politics']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/19BA/production/_132268560_jayson_boebert976getty.jpg'],"['By Jacqueline Howard', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67929818,US defence secretary Lloyd Austin kept cancer diagnosis from the White House,"President Joe Biden was only told that US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was being treated for cancer on Tuesday, the White House has said.",2024-01-10,"President Joe Biden was only told that US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was being treated for cancer on Tuesday, the White House has said. Mr Austin, 70, was admitted to hospital on 1 January and then to the intensive care unit for complications following surgery in December. He has faced criticism for not telling senior officials about it for days. He has since apologised for not ""ensuring the public was appropriately informed"". The lag in notifying the White House raised potential national security concerns and issues of transparency within the Biden administration. The defence secretary sits just below the president in the chain of command for the US military, and is one of the most important members of the president's Cabinet. The Pentagon confirmed Mr Austin remained hospitalised on Tuesday. At a press briefing on Tuesday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that President Biden was only informed that day about the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ""Nobody at the White House knew that Secretary Austin had prostate cancer until this morning,"" he said. While he emphasised the president's initial reaction was concern for the secretary's health, Mr Kirby acknowledged the communications were ""not optimal."" ""This is not the way it is supposed to go,"" Mr Kirby said. Mr Biden and Sec Austin have not spoken since their last interaction over the weekend, according to Mr Kirby. Mr Austin's deputy, Kathleen Hicks, was not informed of his hospital stay despite being asked to assume some of his responsibilities. Doctors for Mr Austin said a check up in December 2023 ""identified prostate cancer which required treatment"". Mr Austin underwent a ""minimally invasive surgical procedure"" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the nation's top military hospital, on 22 December to remove the cancer. He was under general anaesthesia for this procedure. He returned to hospital on 1 January 2024 after experiencing ""complications"", and an evaluation revealed a urinary tract infection. He was transferred to the intensive care unit the next day for further treatment, including for ""abdominal fluid collections impairing the function of his small intestines"". He ""never lost consciousness and never underwent general anaesthesia"" during this hospital stay, doctors said. Mr Austin's infection has cleared and ""he continues to make progress and we anticipate a full recovery although this can be a slow process"". Doctors emphasised that cancer was caught early and said that his ""prognosis is excellent"". A spokesman for Mr Austin did not provide an update for when he would be discharged, but said ""Secretary Austin continues to recover well and remains in good spirits"". At a Tuesday briefing, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder did not provide an explanation for why Mr Austin did not disclose his condition sooner. ""I don't have that specifically,"" he said, but noted that a prostate cancer diagnosis was ""deeply personal"". The Pentagon had said this failure occurred because a key staff member had the flu. Mr Ryder said notification procedures about the hospital stay were under review to ""make sure we're doing better next time"". White House chief of staff Jeff Zients on Tuesday directed members of the president's Cabinet to provide notice when they cannot perform their duties.","['United States', 'Prostate cancer']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3D0/production/_132263914_gettyimages-1857870634-1.jpg'],"['By Kayla Epstein in New York & Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67922303,Gaming voice actors blindsided by 'garbage' union AI deal,Prominent voice actors say they weren't told about a landmark deal setting out how voices generated by artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in games.,2024-01-10,"Prominent voice actors say they weren't told about a landmark deal setting out how voices generated by artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in games. It has been struck by US actors' union Sag-Aftra and AI firm Replica Studios. The union says it guarantees ""fully informed consent and fair compensation"" for its members. But many voice artists, who have long been concerned AI will replace them, have reacted with fury with one calling the deal ""garbage."" It comes after Sag-Aftra led a months-long strike in 2023 to fight for protections from film and television studios using AI. Many voice actors have suggested this new deal is at odds with the purpose of that industrial action, with Fallout and Mortal Kombat voice actor Sunil Malhotra saying he ""sacrificed to strike half of last year to keep my profession alive, not shop around my AI replica"". In a blog covering the announcement, Sag-Aftra said the deal was ""approved by affected members of the union's voiceover performer community"". ""Recent developments in AI technology have underscored the importance of protecting the rights of voice talent, particularly as game studios explore more efficient ways to create their games,"" said the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. ""With this agreement, we have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances."" But Steve Blum, a voice actor once credited by Guinness for being the most prolific in video games, said ""nobody"" he knew of had approved the deal. According to Sag-Aftra, the agreement lays out terms and conditions for AI-generated voices in video games, which can be licensed by Replica Studios both in gaming and other forms of media. It requires the AI firm to get consent from actors before it uses voices based on their likeness, and also gives voice actors the ability to deny their voice being used in perpetuity without their consent. But it has been met with consternation from the performers themselves, with World of Warcraft voice actor Andrew Russell calling it ""garbage"", while Shelby Young, who will provide the voice of Yuko in the upcoming Persona 3: Reload, said she was ""really disappointed"" in the union. Voice actors outside of gaming have also criticised the agreement, with Joshua Seth, known for voicing Tai in animated series Digimon, calling it a ""big mistake"", while audiobook narrator Paige Reisenfeld said she was ""ashamed"" that her union payments went towards it. And Veronica Taylor, who provided the voice for Ash in Pokemon, asked how the deal was made without being put to a vote. But Sag-Aftra president Fran Dresch said the deal was ""a great example of AI being done right"". Meanwhile, Replica Studios CEO Shreya Nivas said the deal was an ""ethical approach"" to AI. ""We are excited by the new opportunities this opens up for world-leading AAA studios who can now access the benefits of Replica's AI voice technology while knowing that talent is recognized and compensated fairly for the use of their likeness,"" he said.","['Artificial intelligence', 'Gaming']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1CD9/production/_132258370_mediaitem132258369.jpg'],"['By Tom Gerken', 'Technology reporter']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67942038,Chris Christie drops out of Republican White House race,Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced he is suspending his presidential campaign.,2024-01-10,"Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced he is suspending his presidential campaign. The Republican, who has run as a harsh critic of Donald Trump, lagged in opinion polls from the outset. Mr Christie had faced pressure to drop out as critics of frontrunner Mr Trump scramble to unify the party behind a viable alternative to the ex-president. This was Mr Christie's second unsuccessful White House campaign. He lost in 2016 to Mr Trump. Mr Christie announced that he was suspending his campaign at a town hall event in the US state of New Hampshire on Wednesday afternoon. In his opening remarks he took a swipe at Mr Trump, accusing him of ""putting himself before the people of this country"". ""Donald Trump wants you to be angry every day because he is angry,"" he added later in his address. It is not clear if he plans to endorse any of the few contenders still standing in the race to challenge Mr Trump for the Republican nomination. Mr Christie's planned exit comes days before the Iowa caucuses, the first of the state-by-state contests in which Republican voters will pick their preferred candidate for president. He launched his 2024 presidential campaign in June last year, and immediately began taking swings at Mr Trump. Mr Christie had hoped to act as attack dog for a field of Trump rivals who dared not cross the Republican base, which remains deeply loyal to the former president. This strategy resulted in some fireworks during the primary debates, but without Mr Trump on stage, Mr Christie failed to land any serious direct blows. Mr Christie has faced pressure from within an anti-Trump faction of the Republican party to drop out, thereby narrowing the field and allowing a challenger such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley to emerge from the pack. Ms Haley has been presenting a possible threat to Mr Trump in New Hampshire. The early-voting state has a large faction of unaffiliated voters, and has been known to deliver unpredictable results. Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist based in New Hampshire, said Mr Christie eventually ""faced the fact that he is not going to be a viable candidate for president moving forward and is choosing to do what he says, which is to try to put forth an effort to ensure that he is not playing the role of a spoiler"". The slogan of Mr Christie's campaign was ""because the truth matters"". But opinion poll after poll showed that Republican primary voters did not want to hear Mr Christie's particular truth. ""Republican voters do not want to hear the same attacks that they've heard from Democrats or even the media for the better part of eight years,"" Mr Bartlett said. ""They just don't want to hear it. There's nothing you can tell a Republican voter about Donald Trump that they have not yet heard over the past decade.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67941527,"Donald Trump will not speak at New York fraud trial, says judge",Donald Trump will not speak during the closing day of his civil fraud trial in New York.,2024-01-10,"Donald Trump will not speak during the closing day of his civil fraud trial in New York. After speculation over whether the former US president would make a statement, the judge shared emails showing he had not agreed to limits on what he could say. ""Take it or leave it,"" the judge told Mr Trump's lawyers. ""Now or never."" Mr Trump's team also asked the judge to postpone Thursday's hearing because of the death of Melania Trump's mother. But Judge Arthur Engoran said he was ""sorry"" but the plans and schedules had already been set. Mr Trump's civil fraud trial is resuming in New York City on Thursday, when lawyers for both sides are set to make their closing arguments. The former president and his two adult sons are accused of massively inflating the value of their properties by hundreds of millions of dollars in order to secure better loans. They deny any wrongdoing. The judge in the case has already ruled that they committed business fraud, but the trial is focusing on six remaining charges - and the judge must also decide how much to fine Mr Trump in penalties. It is not a criminal trial. The prosecutor, New York Attorney General Letitia James, is asking for Mr Trump to be fined $370m (£290m) and be banned from doing real-estate business in New York. For days, there has been speculation in US media over whether Mr Trump might speak during the closing arguments. But on Wednesday, Judge Arthur Engoran released emails between himself and Christopher Kise, one of Mr Trump's lawyers which suggested it would not be happening. In the exchange, Mr Kise first asks the judge for a postponement until the end of January, because of the ""deeply personal matter"" following the death of Mrs Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs, at the age of 78. Judge Engoran says he is ""sorry to hear the sad news"", but denies the request, saying every court appearance by Mr Trump entails a large amount of planning and people to rearrange their schedules. ""Of course, I am also anxious to hear a full day of closing statements as I consider the case as a whole,"" he adds. Mr Kise then replies to say Mr Trump will be speaking on Thursday - but the judge says that if Mr Trump wishes to speak, he has to agree to limitations. During the trial last year, Judge Engoran put a gag order in place that prevented Mr Trump and his team criticising court staff. It came after Mr Trump posted disparaging remarks online about the judge's principal law clerk, with her name, photo and a link to her social media, as he sat in court on the trial's second day. In reply to the judge's email, Mr Kise says: ""This is very unfair, your Honor. You are not allowing President Trump, who has been wrongfully demeaned and belittled by an out of control, politically motivated Attorney General, to speak about the things that must be spoken about."" The judge replies: ""I won't debate this yet again. Take it or leave it. Now or never. You have until noon, seven minutes from now. I WILL NOT GRANT ANY FURTHER EXTENSIONS."" Shortly after the midday deadline, the judge emails Mr Kise again, saying: ""Not having heard from you by the third extended deadline (noon today), I assume that Mr Trump will not agree to the reasonable, lawful limits I have imposed as a precondition to giving a closing statement above and beyond those given by his attorneys, and that, therefore, he will not be speaking in court tomorrow."" Mr Trump is still expected to appear in court on 11 January for the conclusion of the trial, which began in October. Judge Arthur Engoron has suggested he will determine the penalties of the case by the end of the month. Because this was a bench trial, there was no jury.","['United States', 'Donald Trump', 'New York', 'New York City']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6231/production/_132273152_182099299caee87321a5a658372592c8246c53b5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12199/production/_132273147_engoranemails.png']","['By Francesca Gillett', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67938594,Haley and DeSantis face-off in Iowa Republican debate,Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week.,2024-01-10,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will face off against former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the last Republican debate before the Iowa caucus next week. The debate in Des Moines comes as both candidates lag far behind former President Donald Trump in the polls. The 15 January caucus will be the candidates' first electoral test in their effort to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2024. Mr Trump will not be in the debate, but will appear in a Fox News town hall. The former president has so far boycotted every Republican debate, a strategy that proved fruitful. He holds commanding poll leads in Iowa, sometimes up to 30 points, ahead of the state's caucuses. The CNN debate - which is slated for 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) - offers Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley, who stand in second and third place at the polls respectively, a final opportunity to make their case to caucus goers ahead of next week. Two other candidates, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, failed to qualify. The hours before the debate saw last-minute sparring between the two candidates over the airwaves, with a pro-Haley ad criticising Mr DeSantis for allegedly mischaracterising her comments on Gaza, immigration and Hillary Clinton. The ad was entitled ""DeSantis is lying because he's losing"". A super PAC that supports Mr DeSantis also released an ad in Iowa which attacked Ms Haley for saying that the upcoming New Hampshire primary - the second Republican contest - would ""correct"" the results of Iowa. ""Nikki Haley told New Hampshire what she really thinks about Iowa,"" the narrator says in the video. Mrs Haley was recently buoyed by fresh polling that suggests she has cut Mr Trump's lead in New Hampshire to single digits. Analysts have said a strong showing there could make her Republican party's prime alternative pick to the former president. Since serving as Mr Trump's ambassador to the UN during his time in the White House, she has broken with her one-time boss on key areas of foreign policy and criticised his willingness to do business with China. She has seemed to promise a return to a more traditional Republican party, embracing a hawkish foreign policy and faulting members of both parties, including Mr Trump, for running up the national debt. A former South Carolina governor, Mrs Haley has also argued that she is a more palatable candidate for undecided voters than Mr Trump. ""The only way we're going to win the majority of Americans is if we go forward with a new generational leader that leaves the negativity and the baggage in the past and goes forward with the solutions for the future,"" she told a town hall meeting in Iowa on Tuesday. But as her star has ascended in recent weeks, she has faced increased attacks from Mr Trump and Mr DeSantis. She also suffered a recent gaffe, as she failed to say that the Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery - which attracted criticism. By contrast, Mr DeSantis, the two term Florida governor, has sought to tack hard to Mr Trump's right. He has fought a campaign based broadly on culture wars issues and has touted his record of tackling what he called ""woke"" policies in his home state. While an early favourite as an alternative choice to Mr Trump, he has struggled to differentiate himself from his one-time ally. The former president raised Mr DeSantis from relative obscurity as a member of Congress and endorsed him in his run for the Florida governor's office in 2017. Bob Van Der Plaats - the leader of the influential Family Leader organisation - sought to assure Iowa voters that it was safe to support Mr DeSantis over Mr Trump in a Des Moines Register op-ed on Wednesday. ""Caucusing for Ron DeSantis is a good way to be a friend to Donald Trump,"" Mr Van Der Plaats wrote. He added that a ""DeSantis presidency ensures justice for Trump"" and that his preferred candidate is better equipped to fight government ""bureaucracy"" than the former president. It does appear Mr DeSantis is better suited to perform well in Iowa than Mrs Haley, where evangelical voters - a key voting block in the state - could be attracted to his staunch conservative values. Nevertheless, both candidates will likely have to exceed expectations to some degree to step out from under Mr Trump's looming shadow and keep their campaigns alive.","['Donald Trump', 'Republican Party', 'US election 2024', 'Ron DeSantis', 'Nikki Haley']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2217/production/_132272780_gettyimages-1836229967.jpg'],"['By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Matt Murphy', 'BBC News, in Des Moines, Iowa & Washington DC']",World,US & Canada

The money and gifts, typically routed via outside business consultants, were intended to help win business in South Africa, Indonesia and elsewhere, according to US officials. The schemes allegedly operated from at least December 2014 until January 2022. SAP said it had cooperated with investigators and overhauled policies. ""SAP remains vigilant in maintaining the highest standards of ethics and compliance,"" the company said in a statement. SAP, which is headquartered in Germany and has shares listed in the US, is among the world's largest software companies. According to US court documents, subsidiaries of the firm in operating in five countries in Africa, Azerbaijan and Indonesia engaged in bribery schemes, ""repeatedly"" breaking company policies that were intended to guard against corruption. In South Africa, it allegedly paid millions in fees to consultants, despite no work being performed, and funded trips to New York for government officials, including golf outings. In Indonesia, it also funded shopping excursions and dining, as well as making more explicit payments. The Securities and Exchange Commission order cites WhatsApp discussions including the instructions: ""Seventy million, in fifty thousand bills…Bring empty envelope"". Officials said SAP - which was punished for violating US laws against bribery and corruption in Panama in 2016 - had failed to institute processes to address the high risk of such issues, inaccurately recording the bribes as legitimate business expenses. The settlement includes a $118.8m criminal fine, according to the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, which worked with authorities in South Africa on the investigation and announced the deal. Penalties were reduced from the maximum possible after SAP cooperated with investigators and moved to punish and fire employees involved in the payments. ""SAP has accepted responsibility for corrupt practices that hurt honest businesses engaging in global commerce,"" said US Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. ""We will continue to vigorously prosecute bribery cases to protect domestic companies that follow the law while participating in the international marketplace.""

In an impeachment hearing on Wednesday they focused on how states have been affected by his department's actions. Impeaching a cabinet official is rare but the border is emerging as a key political issue that could dominate the 2024 presidential election. A growing number of Americans consider migration across the border a crisis. In December, a record number of migrants were processed at the southern border and for all of 2023 almost 2.5 million people were apprehended there. The Republican-dominated House Committee on Homeland Security has said Mr Mayorkas failed to enforce US laws at the border, which amounts to a ""dereliction of duty"". Committee chairman Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, said impeachment does not just cover criminal behaviour, but also ""gross incompetence"" that can be seen as endangering fellow Americans or betraying public trust. Mississippi's Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said this is ""not a legitimate impeachment"" and suggested that Republicans were throwing ""political red meat to their base"" to keep ""campaign cash coming"". The hearing included testimony from attorneys general from Montana, Oklahoma and Missouri - states led by Republican governors -  who said they have dealt with impacts from his policies even though none of them neighbour Mexico. ""The southern border certainly presents a difficult challenge for any administration, but Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration have absolutely poured gasoline on this fire,"" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen testified. House Speaker Mike Johnson recently led a delegation of Republicans to the border, where they got a ""first-hand look at the damage and chaos the border catastrophe is causing in all of our communities"". Mr Mayorkas also made a trip, one day before the impeachment hearing, where he put the blame on Congress, calling for it to fix immigration policies. He said the accusation that he does not uphold US immigration laws ""could not be further from the truth"" and in a memo his department said that Republicans were making ""baseless and pointless political attacks"" instead of fixing ""broken immigration laws"". Currently, Mr Mayorkas is working with the White House and a bipartisan group of senators to tighten those laws, which Republicans have demanded in exchange for agreeing to President Joe Biden's request for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Meanwhile, immigration has become one of the biggest hurdles facing President Biden's push for re-election. A CBS News poll, released this week, found that 63% of Americans want stricter border policies and 45% of Americans now say there is a crisis at the border. And several Democratic mayors have expressed alarm at the rising number of migrants arriving in their cities, partly due to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's policy of busing new arrivals out of his state. New York Mayor Eric Adams has previously warned the issue could ""destroy"" his city, pointing to a projection that housing the influx of migrants could cost taxpayers $12bn over the next three years. But Democratic lawmakers also say Republicans' move to remove Mr Mayorkas are politically motivated, with New York Congressman Dan Goldman calling them an ""embarrassment to the impeachment clause of the Constitution"". Even if convicted in the Republican-controlled House, it is unlikely the Democrat-controlled Senate would find Mr Mayorkas guilty of any crimes. Still, if he were impeached by the House, he would be the first cabinet official in nearly 150 years to go through the process.","['Immigration', 'Mexico–US border', 'United States']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0E17/production/_132270630_gettyimages-1918134998.jpg'],"['By Chloe Kim', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night. The allies warned of ""consequences"" for such attacks. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Watch this space."" The Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel. The have repeatedly claimed - often falsely - that they are attacking merchant vessels linked to Israel in protest at Israeli actions during the war in Gaza. Tuesday's attack was the 26th on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November. The US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT). Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond. HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said. No injuries or damage were reported. Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving ""a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones"". ""It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel],"" he said. ""The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces,"" he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would ""not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation"". Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to ""prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very concerned"" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the ""risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East"". The UN Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution on Wednesday evening demanding the Houthis stop targeting maritime traffic in the Red Sea. Mr Shapps warned in a statement on Wednesday morning that the UK and its allies had ""previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"". ""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy,"" he added. Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was ""behind so much of the bad things happening in the region"" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be ""consequences"" if the attacks on shipping did not stop. Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: ""I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'."" He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"" last month to protect Red Sea shipping. They said the attacks posed ""a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways"". It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' ""watch this space"" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident. Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to ""telegraph"" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression. They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships. While he may have declined to go into details, our correspondent says it is becoming increasingly difficult to imagine that the ""consequences"" and the ""response"" Mr Blinken discussed in Bahrain will not translate into a use of military force. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority. In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.","['Royal Navy', 'Shipping industry', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Grant Shapps', 'Global trade', 'Houthis', 'United States', 'Yemen']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86A2/production/_132266443_redsea.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AF38/production/_132265844_4d44a6007b89d7deb75cbca44da7cf0d478c148c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/89B8/production/_132065253_thumbnail_bab_al_mandab_strait_2x640-nc.png']","['By David Gritten', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67938683,Illegal New York synagogue tunnel leads to 9 arrests,Nine members of a New York Hasidic Jewish community have been arrested and charged over a secret tunnel that connected to a historic synagogue.,2024-01-10,"Nine members of a New York Hasidic Jewish community have been arrested and charged over a secret tunnel that connected to a historic synagogue. They fought police after city officials and leaders of the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters came to close the tunnel. The men are charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and obstructing governmental administration. A spokesperson for the Chabad called them a ""group of extremist students"". The tunnels were built under a prominent street in Brooklyn, where the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters are located. The building is one of the most significant Jewish sites in the city. City inspectors were called to the Chabad on Monday to conduct an emergency structural inspection. There were looming concerns that the illegal tunnel could have caused damage to the famous property. A brawl broke out after police found a group of young men blocking efforts to inspect and fill the tunnel with cement. Some of the men then broke through the wall of the prayer space. Those acts led to the arrests. Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, the chairman of the Chabad, thanked police for their efforts and said the community was ""pained by the vandalism of a group of young agitators"". ""These odious actions will be investigated, and the sanctity of the synagogue will be restored,"" he said. It is unclear who built the tunnel, how they did it and what their motivations were. It appears the tunnel connects to at least one other building on the street in Brooklyn. One local told the New York Times that the men sought to build the tunnel to hasten the expansion of the synagogue. Some members who have attended services and functions at the Chabad have reportedly complained about overcrowding in the building in recent years. Videos and photos from inside the building on Monday, however, showed a small group of mostly young men trying to block the tunnel from being filled with cement. Others were seen pulling wood panels from the walls of the sanctuary and using benches to block police in the videos and images. One of the videos reviewed by the BBC showed an officer using a spray to break up a growing skirmish. The building, which sees thousands of visitors each year, was formerly the home of the leader of the Orthodox Jewish movement - Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The rabbi is credited with leading the Chabad-Lubavitch and revitalising the Hasidic religious community after it was devastated in the Holocaust. He died in 1994, but his headquarters remains a well-known centre for the Jewish religion. While the Chabad-Lubavitcher movement is sprawling and its mission is to welcome Jews at all levels of religious practice, it also has key divisions within the larger movement. Those divisions appeared to have spilled over in the tunnel dispute at 770 Eastern Parkway this month. A deeply religious fringe group within the Chabad believes Rabbi Schneerson is the Jewish Messiah - an idea the mainstream movement rejects. That disagreement is reportedly an element in the tunnel altercation. The building has been closed as inspection of the tunnels has continued.","['United States', 'Judaism', 'New York City']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C7AD/production/_132271115_gettyimages-1913161182.jpg'],"['By Phil McCausland', 'BBC News, New York']",World,US & Canada

The Oversight Committee was meeting to consider a resolution to hold the president's son in contempt for defying a House subpoena. Cameras blazed as he strode into the room with his attorney, Abbe Lowell. Republicans appeared angered by the move, with Rep Nancy Mace accusing him of ""white privilege"". ""I think that Hunter Biden should be arrested right here, right now, and go straight to jail,"" the South Carolina congresswoman said. ""Our nation is founded on the rule of law and the premise that the law applies equally to everyone, no matter what your last name is."" Democrats on the panel urged Republicans to allow Mr Biden, who sat in the audience, to be allowed to speak. But chair James Comer, who at times struggled to control the hearing, declined: ""Mr Biden doesn't make the rules, we make the rules."" Mr Biden exited Congress without speaking at the hearing a short time later. He exited the room as right-wing Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene began to speak. The Georgia representative, who has previously displayed nude images of Mr Biden during hearings, called him a ""coward"". Though he remained largely quiet as he left the Capitol, Mr Biden did answer one question. It centred on why he allegedly put his father on speakerphone in roughly 20 business meetings he held during Joe Biden's vice-presidency. ""If he called you, would you answer the phone?"" the president's son said. The Oversight Committee is planning to consider the contempt resolution later on Wednesday. Its passage through that body is the first step toward it being considered by the wider House. For Mr Biden to be held in contempt it would require a simple majority in the chamber, which Republicans hold by a slim two-seat margin. The 53-year-old's lawyer, Mr Lowell, who accompanied him, reprimanded Republicans for using Mr Biden as a ""surrogate to attack his father"", President Joe Biden. House Republicans have alleged that Mr Biden and his family unfairly profited from the elder Biden's longstanding political status in Washington. The White House and Hunter Biden have denied the allegations. Hunter Biden was subpoenaed to testify privately about his business dealings for the impeachment case against his father last year. In November, he told House Republicans that he was willing to testify to the Oversight Committee, but only if it was a public hearing. His counsel, Mr Lowell, said it would ""let the light shine"" on the proceedings. Republicans refused, and instead Mr Biden made a rare in-person statement outside the Capitol on the day he was to appear before Congress. He slammed Republicans, alleging they had ""distorted the facts"" and called for a public hearing. The younger Biden is also facing charges for possession of a gun while being an admitted drug addict and for lying on a federal form.","['Hunter Biden', 'Joe Biden', 'Republican Party']",,"['By Brandon Drenon', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66987215,Five things to know about Trump's New York fraud trial,The vast business empire upon which Donald Trump made his name is on the line in a civil fraud trial in New York.,2024-01-10,"The vast business empire upon which Donald Trump made his name is on the line in a civil fraud trial in New York. The former president, his two adult sons and the wider Trump Organization are accused of massively inflating the value of their properties by over $2bn (£1.65bn) in order to secure favourable loans. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing, calling the case a sham. Here are five things to know about the trial, which wraps up this week. A defeat would mark a significant blow to the real estate empire that propelled Mr Trump to national recognition long before he ran for the White House. Those holdings constitute a significant chunk of his personal fortune and self-image. Earlier this year, Forbes Magazine estimated that his New York properties alone are worth $720m of his estimated $2.5bn. Mr Trump has repeatedly pointed to his achievements in the New York real estate market as a source of personal pride. In a 2015 interview with Bella NYC magazine, Mr Trump touted the ""many great buildings"" that he has built and owns as his greatest accomplishment outside of his family. A victory for prosecutors would mean that Mr Trump and his company would have to pay a large fine - they recently increased their request to $370m - and be banned from doing business in New York, prising Trump Tower and the rest of his holdings from his control. Two of Mr Trump's adult children - Donald Jr and Eric - are co-defendants in the case. The two took over the management of the Trump Organization in 2017, the year their father became president. Like their father, both of Mr Trump's sons are accused of what Attorney General Letitia James has described as ""persistent and repeated fraud"" regarding their business. They also deny wrongdoing. The lawsuit filed by Ms James cites multiple specific allegations against both Eric and Donald Jr, largely pertaining to allegedly fraudulent assessments of the value of real estate properties. Eric Trump, for example, is accused of pushing for unapproved and ""not feasible"" developments at the sprawling Seven Springs Estate in Westchester County, as well as hiding its true value and fraudulently increasing the value of tax deductions stemming from it. The lawsuit seeks to bar both men from serving as an officer or director in ""any New York corporation or similar business entity"" registered or licensed in the state. The brothers and their father took the stand during the trial. Their sister Ivanka Trump also testified. She was originally defendant in the lawsuit as well, but an appeals court dismissed the case against her over the summer. Before the start of the trial, the judge in the case, Arthur Engoron, ruled that Mr Trump had misrepresented his wealth by millions of dollars. His Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida was over-valued by 2,300% in one financial statement and his Trump Tower triplex was presented as three times its actual size, the ruling said. The judge ordered that some of Mr Trump's companies be removed from his control. While the scope of this ruling is still unclear, it could mean that the Trump Organization could be forced to hand over control to a court-appointed receiver, or ultimately have to sell some of its most iconic landmarks. The trial has focused on six other claims made in the lawsuit, including falsification of business records, insurance fraud and conspiracy. The trial is a bench trial, meaning that the ultimate decision on whether the co-defendants are liable and any damages or penalties rest on Judge Engoron alone. While Mr Trump, a Republican, has pointed to a lack of jury as evidence that the trial is unfair, Judge Engoron has said his team never asked for a jury. Judge Engoron and Ms James - both Democrats - sparred with Mr Trump and his legal team over the course of the trial. Mr Engoron imposed a gag order on Mr Trump, ordering him to refrain from public statements about court staff. And after Mr Trump said that a court clerk was ""very partisan"", the judge fined him $10,000. Mr Trump claimed that he had been referring to his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified against him. Earlier in the trial the judge imposed a $5,000 fine, also for violating the gag order. The former president has repeatedly called both Judge Engoron and Ms James ""crazy"" and ""deranged"" and in Ms James' case, a ""racist"", conducting a politically motivated witch hunt. This civil case is one of several ongoing legal battles the current Republican presidential frontrunner is facing. He is also facing three criminal indictments. Two relate to his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another to false accounting over hush money. A fourth case sees Mr Trump facing 40 criminal charges over his alleged mishandling of classified material after he left the White House. He also has been sued again by writer E. Jean Carroll, who won a $5 million lawsuit against him last year. The trial for the new lawsuit is set to begin Jan. 16. He denies all the charges.","['United States', 'Donald Trump', 'New York City']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B7F/production/_131311753_9bd3071e51ed3c4324cc271ee17a9899b19e3a3d0_0_7264_47421000x653-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/127BF/production/_131311757_ddc41886f4a672130de09664d35ae31cda0a90d30_0_3480_23201000x667.jpg']","['By Bernd Debusmann Jr', 'BBC News, Washington']",World,US & Canada

Strong winds flipped cars and knocked over homes in Florida, where several tornadoes were reported. More than 1,300 flights in or out of the US were cancelled on Tuesday, according to data from FlightAware. Vice-President Kamala Harris' plane had to be diverted due to weather. A spokesperson for Mrs Harris said that ""inclement weather"" required her plane from Atlanta to land in Virginia rather than neighbouring Maryland on her way back to Washington DC. As of Tuesday evening, more than 630,000 households in the eastern US, from Florida to New York State were without electricity. Gov Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 49 Florida counties, where storms have blown roofs off homes and knocked down power lines. Twelve tornadoes were reported across Florida, Alabama and Georgia by early Tuesday, causing significant damage and, in some areas, prompting search and rescue operations. More than 22 million people were under tornado watches. In Houston County, Alabama, an 81-year-old woman was reportedly killed after a tornado ripped through the area, destroying mobile homes and RVs. One person was killed and two others were critically injured in Claremont, North Carolina, officials said, after a powerful storm moved through a mobile home park. A motorist died in Clayton County, Georgia, officials said, after a tree fell across a highway and crushed the driver's car. And one man was also crushed to death by a toppled tree in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday morning, the local station WVTM reported, citing local officials. A resident of Panama City, Florida, who lives across from a home that was toppled by the wind said it sounded like a ""freight train hitting a brick wall"". ""That's how loud it was,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The storms also left roadways impassable in Panama City, ripped roofs off of buildings and brought hail the size of baseballs. A curfew has been declared for the city's downtown area until 06:00EST (11:00GMT) on Wednesday morning. ""No one should be moving around in this area after dark,"" the Bay County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that more powerful storms are in store for the region and elsewhere in the eastern US. In New Jersey, a coastal flood advisory is in effect until Wednesday. The state's governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and warned residents not to ""underestimate"" the storm. In New York State, Governor Kathy Hochul warned the storm could be ""life threatening"", especially as the expected rainfall would combine with the snow already blanketing the ground, bringing about potential flash-flooding. Around 2,000 migrants living in a city tent shelter on an airfield in Brooklyn were evacuated by authorities to high school gymnasiums until the storms pass. A ground stop was briefly issued at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport - one of the country's busiest - due to excessive snow and ice, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. A stop was also issued for Florida's Tampa International Airport due to a tornado warning. Severe weather has also disrupted road travel in states like Nebraska and Kansas, where state patrol has responded to hundreds of weather-related incidents. ""Please stay home,"" a Kansas state trooper wrote on social media. ""It's getting to the point where we will not be able to rescue you if you get stuck because we are having trouble getting around."" The NWS said it expects the extreme weather to slightly ease going into Wednesday, though snow showers are still possible in some of the already affected areas in the central US and the northeast. Flood warnings issued by the NWS remained in effect on Wednesday morning from Louisiana to Maine, encompassing at least 15 states along the US Atlantic coast.","['United States', 'Florida', 'Severe weather', 'Snow']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/03B2/production/_132264900_vlcsnap-2024-01-09-10h22m42s581.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/74F0/production/_132263992_gettyimages-1913163621.jpg']","['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

Mr Austin, 70, was admitted to hospital on 1 January and then to the intensive care unit for complications following surgery in December. He has faced criticism for not telling senior officials about it for days. He has since apologised for not ""ensuring the public was appropriately informed"". The lag in notifying the White House raised potential national security concerns and issues of transparency within the Biden administration. The defence secretary sits just below the president in the chain of command for the US military, and is one of the most important members of the president's Cabinet. The Pentagon confirmed Mr Austin remained hospitalised on Tuesday. At a press briefing on Tuesday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that President Biden was only informed that day about the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ""Nobody at the White House knew that Secretary Austin had prostate cancer until this morning,"" he said. While he emphasised the president's initial reaction was concern for the secretary's health, Mr Kirby acknowledged the communications were ""not optimal."" ""This is not the way it is supposed to go,"" Mr Kirby said. Mr Biden and Sec Austin have not spoken since their last interaction over the weekend, according to Mr Kirby. Mr Austin's deputy, Kathleen Hicks, was not informed of his hospital stay despite being asked to assume some of his responsibilities. Doctors for Mr Austin said a check up in December 2023 ""identified prostate cancer which required treatment"". Mr Austin underwent a ""minimally invasive surgical procedure"" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the nation's top military hospital, on 22 December to remove the cancer. He was under general anaesthesia for this procedure. He returned to hospital on 1 January 2024 after experiencing ""complications"", and an evaluation revealed a urinary tract infection. He was transferred to the intensive care unit the next day for further treatment, including for ""abdominal fluid collections impairing the function of his small intestines"". He ""never lost consciousness and never underwent general anaesthesia"" during this hospital stay, doctors said. Mr Austin's infection has cleared and ""he continues to make progress and we anticipate a full recovery although this can be a slow process"". Doctors emphasised that cancer was caught early and said that his ""prognosis is excellent"". A spokesman for Mr Austin did not provide an update for when he would be discharged, but said ""Secretary Austin continues to recover well and remains in good spirits"". At a Tuesday briefing, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder did not provide an explanation for why Mr Austin did not disclose his condition sooner. ""I don't have that specifically,"" he said, but noted that a prostate cancer diagnosis was ""deeply personal"". The Pentagon had said this failure occurred because a key staff member had the flu. Mr Ryder said notification procedures about the hospital stay were under review to ""make sure we're doing better next time"". White House chief of staff Jeff Zients on Tuesday directed members of the president's Cabinet to provide notice when they cannot perform their duties.","['United States', 'Prostate cancer']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3D0/production/_132263914_gettyimages-1857870634-1.jpg'],"['By Kayla Epstein in New York & Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

It urged the US to ""stop arming Taiwan"" and take its concerns ""seriously"". This comes just days ahead of pivotal elections in Taiwan, which could push the island further towards - or away - from Beijing. China claims Taiwan as part of its own territory, but the island sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland. ""China expressed its willingness to develop healthy and stable military-to-military relations with the United States on the basis of equality and respect,"" said the defence ministry readout. It went on to say that the US needed to take China's concerns ""seriously"",  adding that Beijing would ""not make any concession or compromise on the Taiwan question and demand that the US side honor the one-China principle, relevant commitments, stop arming Taiwan, and not support Taiwan independence"". Taiwan is a key flashpoint in the tussle between China and the US for supremacy in Asia. In 2022, China refused to resume talks as a protest move after then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022. Their resumption early this week follows a deal struck by Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden during a meeting in November. The two-day talks concluded in Washington on Tuesday. Separately, Taiwan has said it does not consider the launch of a Chinese satellite over the island's southern airspace on Tuesday an act of election interference. A satellite launch on Tuesday afternoon prompted an islandwide air raid alert. Mobile phone users across the self-ruled island received a message warning them to ""be aware for your safety"". Taiwan's defence ministry later apologised for its inaccurate reference to a missile in the alert sent to mobile phones. ""After the national security team has analysed the overall relevant information and taken into account the evaluation of the information of various international allies, political attempts can be ruled out,"" said Lin Yu-chan, a spokesman of Taiwan's presidential office.

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67410372,The last of the Moon men: the stories of the surviving Apollo astronauts,They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.,2024-01-10,"They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Now, more than 50 years on, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is set to heat up once again. A number of private companies are scheduled to send scientific craft to the Moon in 2024 - although the first of these, Peregrine, ran into trouble shortly after launch. And Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17, later this year but that date has slipped into 2025, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Nasa hopes the new programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. The programme's Ken Mattingly and Frank Borman died within a few days of each other late last year. Now only eight people who have voyaged beyond Earth orbit remain. Who are they, and what are their stories? On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement: many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars. ""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time. In December 1968, Bill Anders flew on Apollo 8, the first mission in which humans travelled beyond low Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for the fourth pass across its face, the crew witnessed an ""Earthrise"" for the first time in human history, Anders capturing the moment on film. The image is widely credited with motivating the global environmental movement and leading to the creation of Earth Day, an annual event to promote activism and awareness of caring for the planet. Speaking of the moment, Anders said: ""We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth."" Following his retirement from the space programme in 1969, Anders largely worked in the aerospace industry for several decades. He also served as US Ambassador to Norway for a year in the 1970s. There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC. In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Lovell, Borman and Anders made history when they undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. Jim Lovell is one of only three men to have travelled to the Moon twice, and following Frank Borman's death in November 2023, he became the oldest living astronaut. Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott, the commander of the Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon. As commander of Apollo 10 in May 1969, Tom Stafford led the final test mission for the programme before the planned landing of Apollo 11. On that mission, Stafford and pilot Eugene Cernan became the first crew to fly the lunar landing module outside Earth orbit. Shortly after his return, Stafford was appointed chief of the Astronaut Office, a role he held for almost two years. In 1975 he was Nasa's commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, the first joint space mission between the US and then-Soviet Union, and a precursor to the International Space Station. His Soviet counterpart, Alexey Leonov, became a lifelong friend. Together they had participated in the momentous handshake in orbit, something that would have been unimaginable at the height of the space race.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death. The Bibby Stockholm, which became fully operational in October, has been chartered by the government to hold about 500 people while their asylum claims are processed. The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good. ''He said he was treated very badly there. One egg in the morning. 'They treat us like animals', he said,"" she told the agency. Mr Farruku's cousin, Marenglen Farruku, also told Reuters: ""He went there for a better life. ""He never showed any sign of distress. There are so many unanswered questions what has happened there."" An imam chanted prayers and family members cried out as Mr Farruku's coffin was lowered into a grave, Reuters reported. Mr Farruku's roommate, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, has told BBC News other barge residents might harm themselves if conditions on board did not improve. He said there had been complaints about poor quality food, cold showers, unreliable wi-fi and concerns not being dealt with. He said: ""They're saying Leonard's death is just the beginning. ""They are trying to give a warning. That place is not good for them. Every day their stress is increasing, getting worse."" In a statement, the Home Office said it took the welfare of barge residents ""very seriously"" and had ""rigorous safeguarding processes in place"". ""Any concerns raised about the service delivered on the barge are swiftly addressed through our work with the provider, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year,"" it added.

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"".

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police.

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

Fifteen-month-old Olly Stopforth, from Frodsham, died two days after being discharged from the Countess of Chester Hospital in March 2020. He had a streptococcal infection, which led to sepsis and a viral infection. A jury inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court found medics could have saved him if tests had been carried out. In a statement read out by the coroner the hospital trust said it had improved since Olly's death and was now using the national guidelines on sepsis testing. A solicitor for Olly's parents, Laura and Karl Stopforth, said it had been ""incredibly painful and difficult"" for them to hear from hospital professionals that more should have been done to properly diagnose and treat their son. They felt their son was ""not considered as a priority when he was in hospital"" and they had been ""very upset to hear that the medical staff trusted with their little boy's care did not provide him with adequate medical attention"". ""No parent should lose their young child as they have, it is especially painful because they lost their beautiful boy in preventable circumstances,"" the solicitor added, saying the family would be pursuing a medical negligence claim against the trust. The inquest jury accepted the Covid-19 pandemic had made things harder for staff during the time when Olly was being treated. It heard that hospital staff were under pressure because the pandemic had just started and they were unsure about how it would affect children or how long patients should be kept in hospital. But the jury found the baby was not adequately cared for at the hospital, as doctors thought he only had a viral infection and did not carry out tests that could have shown he was suffering from the more serious bacterial infection. Olly was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital after becoming ill at home and a video consultation with a GP who suspected he had a viral infection. One of the paramedics who took him to hospital thought Olly had ""grossly abnormal"" signs and was ""very poorly"", as he had a rash, a high temperature and a high heart rate. Olly remained at the Accident and Emergency Department for nearly six hours before being transferred to a ward, and was discharged four hours later. His mum Laura found him dead in bed two days later. A consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester, Dr Alison Timmis, told the inquest no steps had been taken to rule out a bacterial infection. She agreed that if Olly had been given antibiotics it was ""very likely"" he would have survived. An expert witness told the inquest she did not understand why a sepsis screening tool had not been used at the hospital. Another expert, microbiologist Prof Vav Cartwright, said in a statement: ""Almost any intravenous antibiotic or antibiotic combination likely to have been employed would have been highly active against streptococcus."" ""On the balance of probabilities Olly would have required a two-week course of antibiotics, after which he would have made a full recovery,"" she added. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said it was her sincere hope the trust had learnt serious lessons. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. Allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank, an inquest into his death heard. There is no evidence to suggest Mr Atkinson alerted staff to his allergy. The 23-year-old, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary an hour after ingesting peanuts. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen section of Dadyal's food safety management documents was blank. Mr Atkinson's flatmate, Luke Isley, previously gave evidence saying that the Newcastle University graduate had raised concerns about what he was eating as little as 30 seconds after beginning to eat his pizza, which sparked panic among his friends when he mentioned peanuts. By the time paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"", according to Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, who said he was ""profoundly unconscious"" by the time he was helped downstairs. He died in hospital less than an hour later. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts.

Ako Hussain Pur, 32, had been hired to carry out building work at the home in Sheffield, prosecutors said. On Friday, at Sheffield Crown Court, Pur, of no fixed address, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Pur was found guilty of sexual assault of a child under 13 following a four-day trial earlier this month. Jurors heard the attack happened in the girl's bedroom in June 2023. After the assault, Pur had told the girl not to tell anyone, the court heard. When confronted by the girl's father, he denied anything had happened, jurors were told. Sentencing, Judge Graham Reeds KC stated Pur had lied throughout the case, adding the victim should have been safe in her own home. After the hearing, Det Con Amy Blakey praised the ""tremendous courage"" of the victim. She added: ""It is thanks to her bravery and the incredible strength of her family that a dangerous man is now behind bars. ""Nothing can reverse the trauma and harm caused by this serious assault, but I hope that the result brings the victim and her family a certain level of closure."" In addition to the jail term, Pur was issued a lifelong sexual harm prevention order, placed on the sex offenders register and told he must serve an additional year on licence after his release.

Michael Rudkin's wife Susan was wrongly convicted of stealing money, while he lost his job and union position. The couple, who are featured in an ITV drama about the scandal, ran a branch in Leicestershire. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said new legislation will ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". The Post Office  prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from IT system Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Sunak announced on Wednesday victims would be able to sign a form to say they were innocent in order to have their convictions overturned and claim compensation. Mr Rudkin, who was played by Shaun Dooley in Mr Bates vs the Post Office, ran the Ibstock branch of the Post Office with his wife. Mrs Rudkin, who is too upset to speak publicly at the moment, was convicted of losing £44,000, given a suspended sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours community service while being electronically tagged. Her husband said: ""If you could even remotely think of what hell would look like, then multiply that by 10, that is how our lives have been the last 15 years, absolute hell. ""It doesn't get much worse than your wife contemplating suicide."" Reacting to the announcement of new legislation, Mr Rudkin said: ""I was pleased [by] the overall principle of making sure that everybody has this blanket overturning of convictions because they've waited far too long for this. ""On top of which, to be compensated, let's see what the detail is. ""It feels as though we're heading in the right direction. After 20 years, I hasten to add."" His wife's conviction was overturned in April 2021 but people's perception of them as a couple did not change dramatically, Mr Rudkin previously told the BBC. However, since the programme - which put the scandal in the spotlight - was broadcast people who he had not spoken to in 20 years have been getting in touch. Mr Rudkin added: ""From feeling castigated throughout your community and your friends... all of a sudden, I'm getting messages from people who I haven't spoken to for 20 years saying 'we saw the programme, we didn't realise. So sorry'."" He said he now wants recompense for their loss of earnings and compensation. The couple dismissed a previous compensation offer which Mr Rudkin called ""obscene"". A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both Post Office and government are committed to providing full, fair and final compensation for the people affected. ""To date, offers of compensation totalling more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 postmasters, the majority of which have been agreed and paid.""

They launched an internal investigation, which found further fraudulent payments. ""I'm incredibly sad and disappointed that this has occurred - for a variety of reasons,"" Mr Fellows said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-67925802,Fenny Compton: The village where Post Office scandal battle began,"It is a sleepy village in Warwickshire with a population of just 800, but Fenny Compton has been thrown into the national spotlight after its village hall was chosen at random for the start of the fightback by victims of the Post Office scandal.",2024-01-10,"It is a sleepy village in Warwickshire with a population of just 800, but Fenny Compton has been thrown into the national spotlight after its village hall was chosen at random for the start of the fightback by victims of the Post Office scandal. Residents spoke to the BBC as the country continues to reel from what has been dubbed the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. It played its ""own little part in that history,"" said Kate Carless, the hall's current treasurer, with the village attracting visitors, some even stopping to take selfies outside the hall. ""I'm no longer the bookings secretary for the village hall, I'm more like its agent at the moment,"" Ms Carless adds. It is here where between 30 and 40 ex sub-postmasters and mistresses met for the first time one Sunday in 2009 - a gathering that led to the creation of the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) campaign group. The occasion was the first time many of them discovered they weren't alone in having fallen victim to the bugs in an accounting system called Horizon. The man who orchestrated that meeting was Alan Bates - now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - for fraudulent activity, based on information from Horizon. Many, including Mr Bates, maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues about errors in the accounting software. But some went to prison for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined, and some even took their own lives or died before getting a chance to clear their names. However, despite the avalanche of new publicity around the scandal, only 93 of them have had their convictions overturned. Now, a fresh police investigation into the Post Office and the way it pursued the cases has been launched, with 50 new potential victims coming forward. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells is also handing back her CBE with immediate effect, after a petition exceeded a million signatures. The TV drama and subsequent publicity has now really ""put the village in the spotlight,"" said Ms Carless. ""We've had people driving past the village hall quite slowly taking photos,"" she said. ""But it's a shame it has had to get to this for those people that have been affected. ""When you started watching the drama you were thinking how could this have happened to people."" In the drama Mr Bates, played by Toby Jones, can be seen seemingly choosing somewhere random for affected sub-postmasters to meet. ""Putting that pin into the map seems to have ignited both the residents and other people, who know that I live here, to get in touch,"" said village hall trustee Keith Hicks. He said he had heard of people taking selfies outside the hall, ""which seems quite amazing"". The hall wasn't used in the filming of the drama, he explained, ""but I can appreciate with the parking issues around here that it wouldn't be easy to bring a production team in"". He said he didn't remember the meeting in 2009, describing it as ""very low key"". ""It wasn't until I listened to the BBC Radio 4 podcast, The Great Post Office Trial, that I realised the significance that this little hall had played in the whole story,"" he said. ""These people were the life and soul of the community and then they were damned by the Post Office without any thought that they may be right. ""The fact that they came together here in the very first place, and realised that they weren't single entities, I think it's very significant."" Other local residents said they had also been amazed at the part their village played in the story. ""When you see him look at the map it's just amazing to think that they came here - it's a proud moment for the little people,"" said Alan Booth. Cindy Williams added there was the start of a local campaign to get Mr Bates back to the village for a visit. ""That would be so interesting, quite honestly,"" she said.

""On-site surveys cannot currently take place, as this may disturb hibernating bats, with surveys usually done from around April onwards. ""Until the impact of this demolition is understood, and suggestions to reduce any impacts are provided, the council is not allowed to grant planning permission.""

Janine Powell, now 52, was wrongfully accused of stealing £74,000 from her branch in Tiverton, Devon. She was sacked and arrested, before being convicted at a trial in Exeter in 2008. She maintained her innocence but was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving five months. Ms Powell said the hardest part of her wrongful jailing had been leaving her children. ""You're stuck behind these four walls in a little room,"" she said. ""You get phone calls to find out what's happening outside with the children. ""I've missed out on doing things with them - I can't get that back."" The Post Office Horizon scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. What happened between 1999 and 2015 is now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. After Ms Powell was released from prison, she spent a further three months wearing a tag. She moved away from Tiverton, but said she could not escape feelings of guilt on her visits back to Devon. ""Even though people were being nice to you, saying 'I know you didn't do it', you know that as soon as you walk away, they're talking about it, saying that you've done it,"" she said. ""You feel guilty."" Some sub-postmasters, like Ms Powell, wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy - and some have since died. The Metropolitan Police is investigating possible fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the Horizon scandal - to which Ms Powell has given evidence - is continuing. The government is now facing increasing calls to bring forward emergency legislation to deal with the scandal and ministers said they would introduce plans to speed up the process ""shortly"". The former Justice Secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, said: ""Perhaps there should be a presumption that all those people who were convicted are in fact not guilty. ""We could go further and simply quash the convictions and render them absolutely void, so that then we're in a position whereby the sort of complications that are hitting the compensation process can be avoided.""

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now."" She said there were many people who ""thoroughly and richly deserve these awards"" but the system was ""devalued"" by others. ""The fact is the honours is broken and needs a complete overhaul by No 10 and onwards to the monarch who rubber stamps what happens,"" she said. ""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said. ""I'm a tiny voice in all of this but I just wanted to stand in solidarity with these people who I can't even begin to comprehend what they've been through."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X  and Facebook.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death. The Bibby Stockholm, which became fully operational in October, has been chartered by the government to hold about 500 people while their asylum claims are processed. The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good. ''He said he was treated very badly there. One egg in the morning. 'They treat us like animals', he said,"" she told the agency. Mr Farruku's cousin, Marenglen Farruku, also told Reuters: ""He went there for a better life. ""He never showed any sign of distress. There are so many unanswered questions what has happened there."" An imam chanted prayers and family members cried out as Mr Farruku's coffin was lowered into a grave, Reuters reported. Mr Farruku's roommate, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, has told BBC News other barge residents might harm themselves if conditions on board did not improve. He said there had been complaints about poor quality food, cold showers, unreliable wi-fi and concerns not being dealt with. He said: ""They're saying Leonard's death is just the beginning. ""They are trying to give a warning. That place is not good for them. Every day their stress is increasing, getting worse."" In a statement, the Home Office said it took the welfare of barge residents ""very seriously"" and had ""rigorous safeguarding processes in place"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-67936371,Heart valve treatment pioneered in West Yorkshire,A heart valve surgery technique is being pioneered in West Yorkshire.,2024-01-10,"A heart valve surgery technique is being pioneered in West Yorkshire. Patients who have leaky valves that are too wide, allowing blood to flow back to the heart, can now have a replacement one fitted. The aortic valves are made from animal tissue by a firm based in the village of Swillington, near Leeds. Leeds General Infirmary is one of only two hospitals in the UK to offer the procedure, which is done by using keyhole surgery. Consultant cardiologist Professor Dan Blackman described the procedure as ""hugely exciting"". He said the valve was placed into a metal frame which is then compressed. ""It's small enough to squeeze into a tube that will fit in the artery in the groin,"" he said. ""So once the valves inside that tube, we can pass it up from the artery in the groin up to the heart under X-ray guidance. ""When in position, essentially, we're pulling the tube back to release the frame and then the frame blinkers itself in position. ""The old valve is squashed behind the frame and the new valve takes over."" Patients receive sedation and painkillers but otherwise stay awake throughout the operation. The JenaValve Trilogy system has only been approved for use in the UK since September, with the first patients being treated at Leeds in October. Angela Ainsworth, from the company, said each valve was handmade at its Swillington factory. ""The tissue is cut to shape and then sutured or stitched into the valve and there's about 1,000 really small stitches that attaches the tissue to the valve,"" she said. ""It's so small that the process has to be done under a microscope."" One of the first people to undergo the surgery was 79-year-old Allan Kidd from Wakefield, who has had heart problems since 2019. He said he hoped the operation would make a difference to his health. ""It's been difficult really, because my breathing has been really bad,"" he said. ""I used to be fit and active and walked everywhere and did all that, but as the breathing got worse and worse, I couldn't even walk from my lunch to the kitchen without getting out of breath.""

Adur and Worthing Council said the waste was expected to remain in its coastal waters until 11:00 GMT on Thursday.“The council is urging visitors to the area’s coastline not to go into the water at this time and to take care on the beach in case waste has been washed ashore,” a spokesman said. Emma Evans, cabinet member for environment and leisure, said the leak was “deeply concerning” and put “residents, visitors and animals at risk”.“We are demanding answers from Southern Water and assurances that this will not happen again,” she said. According to the council, an electrical issue caused two pumps to fail at SW's Shoreham wastewater treatment works, meaning it was unable to release treated waste through its long sea outfall pipe.Instead, it released screened wastewater through its short sea outfall pipe, which is located about 500m offshore in the Shoreham Harbour area, the council added. In a statement, SW said: ""Our teams worked hard through the night to install a temporary pump, which is releasing flows further out to sea via our long sea outfall. We also we have four tankers transferring flows to a nearby treatment works.""We are carrying out investigations on environmental impact. ""We are very sorry that this is happening and are doing everything we can to fix the issue and minimise impact.""Councillor Vicki Wells said she expected such infrastructure to be ""robust"".“Our communities and environment shouldn’t suffer as a consequence of failing equipment,"" she said.“It’s unacceptable for the area’s coastline to be polluted by releases of sewage because pumps have failed.”The Environment Agency has been informed about the leak.

Conservative-run Buckinghamshire County Council says it hopes to have saved nearly £172m via efficiencies and additional income by 2027. Among proposals due to be approved in February, are plans to raise the cost of funerals, parking and pitch hire. The council, which became unitary in 2020, has a yearly budget of more than £500m. The savings would see the cost of cremations rise by £100 to £890 and burials rise to more than £1,000. Motorists in the county will also have to spend more money on parking. The proposed cost of street parking would rise by 20p an hour with hikes expected for multi-storey parking too. Sports teams hiring the Meadowcroft Open Space Park in Aylesbury would see an hourly rise in pitch booking fees. But the authority also hopes to cut its own cloth to help ease the burden on taxpayers. Among its plans are investment in additional children's homes to reduce the cost of external placements, with savings from its social care budget to help more residents live independently. The authority also plans to close office space in Amersham with Conservative group leader Martin Tett also revealing plans to dispose of major assets like the famous 'Pooleys Folly' County Hall building in Aylesbury. More than £100m will be spent over the next four years on the highways network and repairs. Budget proposals put forward include a 2.99% rise in the base rate, with a further 2% rise to be spent on adult social care, meaning a total rise of 4.99% - or an extra £1.69 per week for an average Band D property.

The Stoke-on-Trent station will become Hits Radio in April along with 14 other Bauer Media Group stations, including four West Midlands Free Radio services. The traditionally local stations have already been permitted to broadcast just three hours a day of non-national programmes on weekdays. Bauer said there would be no scheduling or local presenter changes. Stations would retain their breakfast shows, the company confirmed. The Hits Radio brand has already emerged on some FM stations around England, including in Manchester on the service once known as Piccadilly Radio - one of the country's first independent local radio stations. Signal Radio - now known as Signal 1 on FM - began broadcasting from Stoke-on-Trent in September 1983. Its broadcasters have included former BBC Radio 1 breakfast presenter Chris Moyles and TV presenter Anthea Turner. During its history, it provided a choice of Signal services, including Signal 2, which played older hit records. But it emerged last month its Stoke-on-Trent studios were up for sale with an asking price of £600,000 and Bauer said its Signal 1 broadcast team would move to Birmingham this year. Free Radio will go after 12 years, after those stations' previous names, used for more than three decades, were dropped in 2012. The oldest were BRMB, which began in Birmingham in 1974, and Black Country-based Beacon. It started in 1976 and in 1987 launched a service for Shropshire. Mercia, for Coventry and Warwickshire, began in 1980 and Wyvern for Herefordshire and Worcestershire started in 1982. Guidelines from regulator Ofcom now allow stations to broadcast national programmes for most of the day. Hits Radio's presenters include singer-songwriter Fleur East and Made in Chelsea star Sam Thompson. Group programme director for the Hits Radio Network Gary Stein said the audio landscape had evolved dramatically in recent years and there was ""even more choice"" than ever before. He added: ""By transforming local stations into this nationally-recognised brand, we're really excited by the potential that Hits Radio has to grow.""

The victim needed hospital treatment after he was injured at Acapella on Frederick Street, Birmingham. The bar was forced to immediately close, but was later told it could reopen if customers were subjected to the checks on certain days.

At the meeting, premises licence holder Seyhmus Ozdemir, said staff had finished their shifts and he had closed the bar. He said he was unaware the shooting on 10 December had taken place, before he was contacted the next morning by police, who confirmed it.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

Fifteen-month-old Olly Stopforth, from Frodsham, died two days after being discharged from the Countess of Chester Hospital in March 2020. He had a streptococcal infection, which led to sepsis and a viral infection. A jury inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court found medics could have saved him if tests had been carried out. In a statement read out by the coroner the hospital trust said it had improved since Olly's death and was now using the national guidelines on sepsis testing. A solicitor for Olly's parents, Laura and Karl Stopforth, said it had been ""incredibly painful and difficult"" for them to hear from hospital professionals that more should have been done to properly diagnose and treat their son. They felt their son was ""not considered as a priority when he was in hospital"" and they had been ""very upset to hear that the medical staff trusted with their little boy's care did not provide him with adequate medical attention"". ""No parent should lose their young child as they have, it is especially painful because they lost their beautiful boy in preventable circumstances,"" the solicitor added, saying the family would be pursuing a medical negligence claim against the trust. The inquest jury accepted the Covid-19 pandemic had made things harder for staff during the time when Olly was being treated. It heard that hospital staff were under pressure because the pandemic had just started and they were unsure about how it would affect children or how long patients should be kept in hospital. But the jury found the baby was not adequately cared for at the hospital, as doctors thought he only had a viral infection and did not carry out tests that could have shown he was suffering from the more serious bacterial infection. Olly was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital after becoming ill at home and a video consultation with a GP who suspected he had a viral infection. One of the paramedics who took him to hospital thought Olly had ""grossly abnormal"" signs and was ""very poorly"", as he had a rash, a high temperature and a high heart rate. Olly remained at the Accident and Emergency Department for nearly six hours before being transferred to a ward, and was discharged four hours later. His mum Laura found him dead in bed two days later. A consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester, Dr Alison Timmis, told the inquest no steps had been taken to rule out a bacterial infection. She agreed that if Olly had been given antibiotics it was ""very likely"" he would have survived. An expert witness told the inquest she did not understand why a sepsis screening tool had not been used at the hospital. Another expert, microbiologist Prof Vav Cartwright, said in a statement: ""Almost any intravenous antibiotic or antibiotic combination likely to have been employed would have been highly active against streptococcus."" ""On the balance of probabilities Olly would have required a two-week course of antibiotics, after which he would have made a full recovery,"" she added. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said it was her sincere hope the trust had learnt serious lessons. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

The proposed Exmouth station, to include a public inquiry desk, was given £5m funding in June 2023. But Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez, said a survey delay was ""driving her batty"". East Devon District Council confirmed bats had held up surveys and planning application processing. A spokesperson added: ""As the proposal involves demolishing the existing police station, further wildlife surveys are required to confirm if there are any legally protected species in the building that would be affected. ""On-site surveys cannot currently take place, as this may disturb hibernating bats, with surveys usually done from around April onwards. ""Until the impact of this demolition is understood, and suggestions to reduce any impacts are provided, the council is not allowed to grant planning permission."" It said the council had offered ""pre-application advice"" for a fee, so other elements such as design and impacts on highways and surrounding buildings, need not be impacted by the delay. Ms Hernandez previously said the station site would be redeveloped and a modern facility built for officers and staff. This week on social media she said: ""Bats stall my office's planning application for the new Exmouth Police Station. ""I have to wait until roosting season May-Sept to carry out a survey before East Devon District Council will even register the planning application. It's driving me batty! Can't blame the bats though."" The closure of the station to the public in 2015 was criticised but it has remained an operational base. The new station is due to be be financed by the sale of part of the existing site in North Street. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67934781,Gender-critical social worker wins tribunal against Westminster council,A social worker who was suspended for sharing gender-critical views on social media has won an employment tribunal.,2024-01-10,"A social worker who was suspended for sharing gender-critical views on social media has won an employment tribunal. Rachel Meade, from Dartford, Kent, won her claim on the basis that the views shared were protected beliefs under the Equality Act. Her employer, Westminster City Council, apologised for the way she had been treated. The professional regulatory body, Social Work England, said it would not comment further. Ms Meade said it was a ""huge relief to be so completely vindicated after all this time"". She had been a social worker for about 20 years before she was suspended for sharing views online that were gender-critical - where one believes that sex is a fact of biology that cannot be changed. The employment tribunal report stated Ms Meade held ""gender-critical beliefs, which includes the belief that sex is immutable and not to be confused with gender identity"". Following a complaint, Social Work England deemed her Facebook posts to be ""discriminatory in nature"" and started an investigation. The process culminated in a formal sanction, which was later withdrawn. Westminster City Council suspended Ms Meade on charges of gross misconduct, saying her social media posts could be deemed ""transphobic"". The charge of gross misconduct was eventually dropped, but while the investigation was carried out Ms Meade was suspended from work for a year. Ms Meade took both organisations to an employment tribunal, which was heard in July. In the judgment published on Monday, the tribunal said all of her Facebook posts and other communications ""fell within her protected rights for freedom of thought and freedom to manifest her beliefs"". The council investigation reported that ""holding discriminatory beliefs is of significant concern given her position of trust as a social worker"". The tribunal panel said the comments were not discriminatory and that it was ""wholly inappropriate that an individual such as (Ms Meade) espousing one side of the debate should be labelled discriminatory"". It added: ""Freedom of speech inevitably will involve the right to, on occasion, cause offence to some people but it is clear that that does not preclude an individual's ability to express such views."" Ms Meade said it had been a ""horrendous experience"". ""This ruling makes it clear that I was entitled to contribute to the important public debate on sex and gender,"" she said. Ms Meade's solicitor, Shazia Khan, said: ""This is a landmark victory for common sense and free speech in the culture war on gender issues."" This case is another example of where views related to transgender rights, often loudly discussed and shared on social media, can end up in the courts. It's happened against a backdrop of polarising opinions between the Scottish and UK governments on self-ID, disagreements about participation in certain sports and the discussion of the definition of sex itself in equalities law. The tribunal panel acknowledged that this debate can be toxic, but also noted that freedom of expression shouldn't be restricted in a democratic society. What the judgment indicates is that these conversations can and will continue. The boundary between that freedom to express protected beliefs and what constitutes offence to others will likely continue to be disagreed over publicly and privately. And the ruling sends out a signal, which will no doubt also be met with divided opinions, that employers need to think carefully about the way they respond to these differences and if, when and how to get involved. Westminster City Council told the BBC: ""We apologise to Rachel Meade for the way she has been treated and the upset that has been caused. We acknowledge and accept the findings of the tribunal. ""As recent landmark cases have shown and the tribunal noted, the issues and policy-making involving gender recognition and rights is a fast-evolving area."" The council said it would study the points made in the judgment and consider what changes it needed to make ""to ensure the best balance we can to support our staff, service users and our partners"". Social Work England said it acknowledged the panel's report and all parties had the ""opportunity to consider the decision and their options"". Ms Meade will find out in February how much compensation she is owed. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Lloyd Hatton, flood response lead at Surrey Fire and Rescue Service, said 50 to 100 people had been evacuated from Addlestone and over 150 people led to safety in Chertsey since Sunday. Residents have seen water levels start to fall after four days of flooding. Warnings remain in place but the risk from Thursday is said to be very low. Surrey County Council leader Tim Oliver said firefighters had evacuated more than 300 people from homes and a business and had also rescued people from cars and boats. In the early hours of Monday, 32 people were also evacuated from Abbeyfields mobile home park in Thameside, Chertsey, on the banks of the river. Traveller Sol Smith said a group of 20 caravans had to leave their pitch at a site behind Abbeyfields mobile home park on Saturday night. He said the river burst its banks near the M3 and flooded nearby fields and lakes before it reached the travellers. He said Spelthorne council had warned the group about the floods three days earlier, but had not told them where to go. ""We are 20 caravans and each one has a family with about two or three children, some of them have four or five,"" he said. ""We can't be on a road. We're at Sheep Walk. We're still there now and vehicles are still trying to cut through."" By Wednesday, a landowner had offered a site off the road, but Mr Smith said the council and the landowner were still trying to resolve ""red tape"". He also said the council had provided four toilets and a friend had provided another, but there were not enough. Spelthorne Council referred the BBC to Surrey County Council. The BBC is approaching the county council  for comment. Mr Hatton said said firefighters had returned to Chertsey and Addlestone to help those who had lost power or who had welfare issues. Four dedicated rest centres also opened in the area, he said. He warned people not to drive or walk through flood water. On Tuesday, families put on waders to walk through water flooding the A308. Mr Hatton said: ""You can't see through this water. You've got broken drains. You've got debris. There's lots of hidden dangers."" He added: ""All fire and rescue personnel treat this water as contaminated water because it is. It is a danger to health. ""So just think safety when you're going through these flood areas and avoid it where possible."" Almost the whole of the Thames in Surrey has been subject to warnings, affecting areas including Chertsey, Walton, Sunbury, Molesey and Egham. Runnymede councillor Sam Jenkins said: ""The water levels on the Thames seem to be stabilising, but the fallout for Runnymede isn't over yet. Some properties are still at significant risk."" Surrey County Council previously said it was working with the Environment Agency and borough councils to deliver a flood relief plan,  known as the River Thames Scheme. A six-week statutory consultation will run from 22 January to 4 March with public meetings in Egham, Chertsey, Shepperton, Molesey, Walton-on-Thames, Sunbury, Staines and Thorpe. The Environment Agency said floods were on a par with those in 2003 but not expected to reach levels seen in 2014. One Staines resident described the floods as a ""repeat performance"" of 2014. Angeli Gyani, whose house near the Runnymede Pleasure Ground was marooned in waist-deep water, said there had been comparisons between the water levels of 2014 but no-one had looked at the speed. ""It came in so fast,"" she said. ""It was coming up much faster this year, faster than in 2014, which is critical. Knowing the speed of it allows you to prepare."" She said her husband David Mason had been monitoring data and had heard from the Environment Agency several flood gauges had become unresponsive, probably due to water ingress. She said that gauges at Bell Weir in Old Windsor had been unresponsive since Monday evening. The Environment Agency confirmed the gauges at Bell Weir Lock were currently not transmitting data. A spokesman for the agency said: ""When the flood water has reduced and we are able to safely access the gauges we will fix the assets. This does not affect our ability to monitor and predict flood risk, as the gauges at Bell Weir are part of a much larger network which provide a picture across the whole Thames and its tributaries."" He said the gauges at Old Windsor and Staines remained operational. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Radio City, which has broadcast from St John's Beacon since 1974, will become Hits Radio Liverpool as part of a rebrand of Bauer Media's stations. The beacon was given listed status in 2020 and its listing includes a reference to the Radio City branding. Bauer Media said it was ""reviewing all options"" in terms of its future. It acknowledged the importance of the branding, as it is known locally as the Radio City Tower. It can be seen around the city, and from the waterfront forms part of the skyline along with the Liver Building, the Cunard building and the Port of Liverpool building. The station is one of 15 to be rebranded by Bauer - including Sheffield's Hallam FM which will become Hits Radio South Yorkshire, and Preston's Rock FM which will become Hits Radio Lancashire. Bauer Media Audio UK CEO Simon Myciunka said it was a ""brand new chapter"" for the stations, transforming it into a ""nationally-recognised brand"". A spokesman for the company said St John's Beacon housed its breakfast show and local teams, along with its sister station Greatest Hits Radio. Its show ""Greatest Hits at Breakfast with Rossie"" is broadcast live from the tower each weekday morning. The spokesman said: ""An iconic landmark of the city, we're sensitive to the history its branding holds while also being open to options that better reflect its new era as home to Hits Radio and Greatest Hits Radio. ""We're reviewing all options and will share updates in due course."" Reacting on X, listeners said it was a shame to see the name go from the radio station, with some saying they would no longer listen. Replying to a Radio City post, one listener said: ""As a radio lover & admirer of Liverpool, I am very saddened at this change, just shy of your 50th anniversary & I know this will be felt by many down there. ""Radio City's contribution to Liverpool & Merseyside in general since 1974 has been exemplary & the name will be missed."" Another X user, said: ""You do realise everyone will still call u Radio City & the tower where u are based will still be called Radio City Tower by everyone? ""Radio City is a 50 yr old brand name in Lpool."" Gary Stein, Group Programme Director for the Hits Radio Network said: ""We are passionate about radio and the unique mix of companionship, information and entertainment that it offers and want to make sure it thrives in years to come. ""The audio landscape has evolved dramatically in recent years and, thanks to advances in digital listening, there is even more choice for audiences than ever before.

Public Health Director, Professor Matt Ashton examined the health challenges for the city up to 2040. He said without change residents could spend a quarter of their life in ill health, life expectancy for women could fall and the number of adults experiencing depression could double. ""The findings are a stark and clear call for urgent action,"" he added. The BBC has contacted the government for a response. Liverpool City Council leader Liam Robinson said the report was ""a sobering read which lays bare the challenges we face in improving the health of our population"". Mr Ashton looked at the health of Liverpool's residents since 1984 and outlined what actions were needed. The report said Liverpool was currently the third most deprived local authority area in England, with 63% of residents living in areas ranked among the most deprived in England, and 3 three in 10 children living in poverty. Life expectancy is currently 76.1 years for men and 79.9 years for women. The national average is 79.0 years for men and 82.9 years for women. Prof Ashton's report said without radical and systemic change by 2040: He outlined a number of recommendations for local and national government. He said Liverpool City Council should work to address challenges in housing, income, climate change, mental health and welfare, as well as improve healthcare services. He also made three recommendations for the government, including a push to devolve health powers to improve services and the ability to set a minimum price for alcohol, a fast food tax and more investment in preventative services. Mr Ashton said poor physical and mental health ""shortens lives lived in good health and impacts not just on individuals but on those around them"". ""It is demonstrated to have a major detrimental impact on the economy through reduced productivity and increased demand for public services, and is a vicious cycle that needs to be broken."" Liverpool City Council's opposition leader Carl Cashman said the report was a ""wakeup call for the city, the council and the government"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gy2l3zznro,Poor value for money prescription service axed,,2024-01-10,"A medicine prescription service is being scrapped because officials say it does not provide value for money.The NHS Prescription Ordering Direct (POD) service was set up to cut waste and save millions of pounds per year.However, despite being used by dozens of GP practices in Coventry and Warwickshire it will close at the end of March.Coventry City Council’s health scrutiny board will discuss the change next week. The POD service was established in the region in 2015 and takes orders from patients online and over the phone, which are then passed to a GP to be signed-off before going to a pharmacy to be dispensed.It was estimated the service was saving about £6m per year, according to a council briefing in December 2018.People ordering from the POD were asked about their existing stock of medicine, helping to reduce waste and reduce stockpiling, the briefing added. It said patients also found the service convenient and reduced GP workloads.But health bosses are now axing the service, citing a “lack of value for money” as well as worsening performance and operational problems.They said GP surgeries using the service would go back to dealing directly with repeat prescriptions and be given access to a £200,000 funding pot to help with the change. A report into the decision has conceded that discontinuing the service could add to GPs’ workload.“We are clear that this is a time when primary care is already under significant pressure and the ICB is committed to supporting our GP practices to manage any potential issues,” it said.Patients are set to receive double prescriptions before it ends, so they have enough to cover the early weeks in April, in an effort to reduce the impact on GP services.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death.

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place.""

Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night.

He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras).

Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death. The Bibby Stockholm, which became fully operational in October, has been chartered by the government to hold about 500 people while their asylum claims are processed. The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good. ''He said he was treated very badly there. One egg in the morning. 'They treat us like animals', he said,"" she told the agency. Mr Farruku's cousin, Marenglen Farruku, also told Reuters: ""He went there for a better life. ""He never showed any sign of distress. There are so many unanswered questions what has happened there."" An imam chanted prayers and family members cried out as Mr Farruku's coffin was lowered into a grave, Reuters reported. Mr Farruku's roommate, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, has told BBC News other barge residents might harm themselves if conditions on board did not improve. He said there had been complaints about poor quality food, cold showers, unreliable wi-fi and concerns not being dealt with. He said: ""They're saying Leonard's death is just the beginning. ""They are trying to give a warning. That place is not good for them. Every day their stress is increasing, getting worse."" In a statement, the Home Office said it took the welfare of barge residents ""very seriously"" and had ""rigorous safeguarding processes in place"". ""Any concerns raised about the service delivered on the barge are swiftly addressed through our work with the provider, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year,"" it added.

Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

Fifteen-month-old Olly Stopforth, from Frodsham, died two days after being discharged from the Countess of Chester Hospital in March 2020. He had a streptococcal infection, which led to sepsis and a viral infection. A jury inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court found medics could have saved him if tests had been carried out. In a statement read out by the coroner the hospital trust said it had improved since Olly's death and was now using the national guidelines on sepsis testing. A solicitor for Olly's parents, Laura and Karl Stopforth, said it had been ""incredibly painful and difficult"" for them to hear from hospital professionals that more should have been done to properly diagnose and treat their son. They felt their son was ""not considered as a priority when he was in hospital"" and they had been ""very upset to hear that the medical staff trusted with their little boy's care did not provide him with adequate medical attention"". ""No parent should lose their young child as they have, it is especially painful because they lost their beautiful boy in preventable circumstances,"" the solicitor added, saying the family would be pursuing a medical negligence claim against the trust. The inquest jury accepted the Covid-19 pandemic had made things harder for staff during the time when Olly was being treated. It heard that hospital staff were under pressure because the pandemic had just started and they were unsure about how it would affect children or how long patients should be kept in hospital. But the jury found the baby was not adequately cared for at the hospital, as doctors thought he only had a viral infection and did not carry out tests that could have shown he was suffering from the more serious bacterial infection. Olly was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital after becoming ill at home and a video consultation with a GP who suspected he had a viral infection. One of the paramedics who took him to hospital thought Olly had ""grossly abnormal"" signs and was ""very poorly"", as he had a rash, a high temperature and a high heart rate. Olly remained at the Accident and Emergency Department for nearly six hours before being transferred to a ward, and was discharged four hours later. His mum Laura found him dead in bed two days later. A consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester, Dr Alison Timmis, told the inquest no steps had been taken to rule out a bacterial infection. She agreed that if Olly had been given antibiotics it was ""very likely"" he would have survived. An expert witness told the inquest she did not understand why a sepsis screening tool had not been used at the hospital. Another expert, microbiologist Prof Vav Cartwright, said in a statement: ""Almost any intravenous antibiotic or antibiotic combination likely to have been employed would have been highly active against streptococcus."" ""On the balance of probabilities Olly would have required a two-week course of antibiotics, after which he would have made a full recovery,"" she added. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said it was her sincere hope the trust had learnt serious lessons. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Janine Powell, now 52, was wrongfully accused of stealing £74,000 from her branch in Tiverton, Devon. She was sacked and arrested, before being convicted at a trial in Exeter in 2008. She maintained her innocence but was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving five months. Ms Powell said the hardest part of her wrongful jailing had been leaving her children. ""You're stuck behind these four walls in a little room,"" she said. ""You get phone calls to find out what's happening outside with the children. ""I've missed out on doing things with them - I can't get that back."" The Post Office Horizon scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. What happened between 1999 and 2015 is now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. After Ms Powell was released from prison, she spent a further three months wearing a tag. She moved away from Tiverton, but said she could not escape feelings of guilt on her visits back to Devon. ""Even though people were being nice to you, saying 'I know you didn't do it', you know that as soon as you walk away, they're talking about it, saying that you've done it,"" she said. ""You feel guilty."" Some sub-postmasters, like Ms Powell, wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy - and some have since died. The Metropolitan Police is investigating possible fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the Horizon scandal - to which Ms Powell has given evidence - is continuing. The government is now facing increasing calls to bring forward emergency legislation to deal with the scandal and ministers said they would introduce plans to speed up the process ""shortly"". The former Justice Secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, said: ""Perhaps there should be a presumption that all those people who were convicted are in fact not guilty. ""We could go further and simply quash the convictions and render them absolutely void, so that then we're in a position whereby the sort of complications that are hitting the compensation process can be avoided.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67939205,New Post Office law 'a step in the right direction',A man caught up in the Post Office scandal with his wife says a proposed new law to exonerate victims is a step in the right direction.,2024-01-10,"A man caught up in the Post Office scandal with his wife says a proposed new law to exonerate victims is a step in the right direction. Michael Rudkin's wife Susan was wrongly convicted of stealing money, while he lost his job and union position. The couple, who are featured in an ITV drama about the scandal, ran a branch in Leicestershire. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said new legislation will ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". The Post Office  prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from IT system Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Sunak announced on Wednesday victims would be able to sign a form to say they were innocent in order to have their convictions overturned and claim compensation. Mr Rudkin, who was played by Shaun Dooley in Mr Bates vs the Post Office, ran the Ibstock branch of the Post Office with his wife. Mrs Rudkin, who is too upset to speak publicly at the moment, was convicted of losing £44,000, given a suspended sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours community service while being electronically tagged. Her husband said: ""If you could even remotely think of what hell would look like, then multiply that by 10, that is how our lives have been the last 15 years, absolute hell. ""It doesn't get much worse than your wife contemplating suicide."" Reacting to the announcement of new legislation, Mr Rudkin said: ""I was pleased [by] the overall principle of making sure that everybody has this blanket overturning of convictions because they've waited far too long for this. ""On top of which, to be compensated, let's see what the detail is. ""It feels as though we're heading in the right direction. After 20 years, I hasten to add."" His wife's conviction was overturned in April 2021 but people's perception of them as a couple did not change dramatically, Mr Rudkin previously told the BBC. However, since the programme - which put the scandal in the spotlight - was broadcast people who he had not spoken to in 20 years have been getting in touch. Mr Rudkin added: ""From feeling castigated throughout your community and your friends... all of a sudden, I'm getting messages from people who I haven't spoken to for 20 years saying 'we saw the programme, we didn't realise. So sorry'."" He said he now wants recompense for their loss of earnings and compensation. The couple dismissed a previous compensation offer which Mr Rudkin called ""obscene"". A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both Post Office and government are committed to providing full, fair and final compensation for the people affected. ""To date, offers of compensation totalling more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 postmasters, the majority of which have been agreed and paid.""

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. Allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank, an inquest into his death heard. There is no evidence to suggest Mr Atkinson alerted staff to his allergy. The 23-year-old, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary an hour after ingesting peanuts. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen section of Dadyal's food safety management documents was blank. Mr Atkinson's flatmate, Luke Isley, previously gave evidence saying that the Newcastle University graduate had raised concerns about what he was eating as little as 30 seconds after beginning to eat his pizza, which sparked panic among his friends when he mentioned peanuts. By the time paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"", according to Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, who said he was ""profoundly unconscious"" by the time he was helped downstairs. He died in hospital less than an hour later. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts. The inquest, which is expected to conclude within two weeks, continues. Follow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Ako Hussain Pur, 32, had been hired to carry out building work at the home in Sheffield, prosecutors said. On Friday, at Sheffield Crown Court, Pur, of no fixed address, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Pur was found guilty of sexual assault of a child under 13 following a four-day trial earlier this month. Jurors heard the attack happened in the girl's bedroom in June 2023. After the assault, Pur had told the girl not to tell anyone, the court heard. When confronted by the girl's father, he denied anything had happened, jurors were told. Sentencing, Judge Graham Reeds KC stated Pur had lied throughout the case, adding the victim should have been safe in her own home. After the hearing, Det Con Amy Blakey praised the ""tremendous courage"" of the victim. She added: ""It is thanks to her bravery and the incredible strength of her family that a dangerous man is now behind bars. ""Nothing can reverse the trauma and harm caused by this serious assault, but I hope that the result brings the victim and her family a certain level of closure."" In addition to the jail term, Pur was issued a lifelong sexual harm prevention order, placed on the sex offenders register and told he must serve an additional year on licence after his release.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-67925802,Fenny Compton: The village where Post Office scandal battle began,"It is a sleepy village in Warwickshire with a population of just 800, but Fenny Compton has been thrown into the national spotlight after its village hall was chosen at random for the start of the fightback by victims of the Post Office scandal.",2024-01-10,"It is a sleepy village in Warwickshire with a population of just 800, but Fenny Compton has been thrown into the national spotlight after its village hall was chosen at random for the start of the fightback by victims of the Post Office scandal. Residents spoke to the BBC as the country continues to reel from what has been dubbed the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. It played its ""own little part in that history,"" said Kate Carless, the hall's current treasurer, with the village attracting visitors, some even stopping to take selfies outside the hall. ""I'm no longer the bookings secretary for the village hall, I'm more like its agent at the moment,"" Ms Carless adds. It is here where between 30 and 40 ex sub-postmasters and mistresses met for the first time one Sunday in 2009 - a gathering that led to the creation of the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) campaign group. The occasion was the first time many of them discovered they weren't alone in having fallen victim to the bugs in an accounting system called Horizon. The man who orchestrated that meeting was Alan Bates - now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - for fraudulent activity, based on information from Horizon. Many, including Mr Bates, maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues about errors in the accounting software. But some went to prison for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined, and some even took their own lives or died before getting a chance to clear their names. However, despite the avalanche of new publicity around the scandal, only 93 of them have had their convictions overturned. Now, a fresh police investigation into the Post Office and the way it pursued the cases has been launched, with 50 new potential victims coming forward. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells is also handing back her CBE with immediate effect, after a petition exceeded a million signatures. The TV drama and subsequent publicity has now really ""put the village in the spotlight,"" said Ms Carless. ""We've had people driving past the village hall quite slowly taking photos,"" she said. ""But it's a shame it has had to get to this for those people that have been affected. ""When you started watching the drama you were thinking how could this have happened to people."" In the drama Mr Bates, played by Toby Jones, can be seen seemingly choosing somewhere random for affected sub-postmasters to meet. ""Putting that pin into the map seems to have ignited both the residents and other people, who know that I live here, to get in touch,"" said village hall trustee Keith Hicks. He said he had heard of people taking selfies outside the hall, ""which seems quite amazing"". The hall wasn't used in the filming of the drama, he explained, ""but I can appreciate with the parking issues around here that it wouldn't be easy to bring a production team in"". He said he didn't remember the meeting in 2009, describing it as ""very low key"". ""It wasn't until I listened to the BBC Radio 4 podcast, The Great Post Office Trial, that I realised the significance that this little hall had played in the whole story,"" he said. ""These people were the life and soul of the community and then they were damned by the Post Office without any thought that they may be right. ""The fact that they came together here in the very first place, and realised that they weren't single entities, I think it's very significant."" Other local residents said they had also been amazed at the part their village played in the story. ""When you see him look at the map it's just amazing to think that they came here - it's a proud moment for the little people,"" said Alan Booth. Cindy Williams added there was the start of a local campaign to get Mr Bates back to the village for a visit. ""That would be so interesting, quite honestly,"" she said.

The proposed Exmouth station, to include a public inquiry desk, was given £5m funding in June 2023. But Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez, said a survey delay was ""driving her batty"". East Devon District Council confirmed bats had held up surveys and planning application processing. A spokesperson added: ""As the proposal involves demolishing the existing police station, further wildlife surveys are required to confirm if there are any legally protected species in the building that would be affected. ""On-site surveys cannot currently take place, as this may disturb hibernating bats, with surveys usually done from around April onwards. ""Until the impact of this demolition is understood, and suggestions to reduce any impacts are provided, the council is not allowed to grant planning permission."" It said the council had offered ""pre-application advice"" for a fee, so other elements such as design and impacts on highways and surrounding buildings, need not be impacted by the delay. Ms Hernandez previously said the station site would be redeveloped and a modern facility built for officers and staff. This week on social media she said: ""Bats stall my office's planning application for the new Exmouth Police Station. ""I have to wait until roosting season May-Sept to carry out a survey before East Devon District Council will even register the planning application. It's driving me batty! Can't blame the bats though."" The closure of the station to the public in 2015 was criticised but it has remained an operational base.

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now."" She said there were many people who ""thoroughly and richly deserve these awards"" but the system was ""devalued"" by others. ""The fact is the honours is broken and needs a complete overhaul by No 10 and onwards to the monarch who rubber stamps what happens,"" she said. ""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said.

Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel.

She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

Tim Jones, from the South West Business Council, said one in five shops were now empty in the region, while 1,800 premises closed in 2022 alone. He said this was the highest rate seen since the financial crash of 2007 and 2008. Torbay Council said it was working to help businesses survive. But Mr Jones added: ""Everyone wants to go online at the moment."" ""The costs that shopkeepers are incurring - business rates, higher minimum wages, insurance, inflation - all those things are dramatically affecting the fortunes of the high street. ""We just cannot afford to lose them. ""This is an important part not just of the economy but of the social fabric of many of our market towns."" Meanwhile, the South West Business Council said the region lost £2.6bn in trade during Covid, with sectors including pharmacies and banks among the worst hit as consumers increasingly choose to shop online. George Helmore, a commercial department specialist, said: ""We've seen some larger investments which were potentially London-owned or foreign investments which have now gone to auction and have been sold. ""A lot of them have been bought up by more local people, which is great because local people want to spend money locally and make properties look better"". Torbay Council said it would invest £11m in Union Square, supported by £21.9m from the government's Towns Fund, part of its plan to ""level up"" the country and revealed in November 2023. Chris Lewis, deputy leader at Torbay Council, said there were ""too many shops for the present day"", leading to some being knocked down.

Mr Goodall also called on the Environment Agency (EA) to get on with the delayed construction of the flood defences in Severn Stoke.He said people’s livelihoods were being put at risk as a result of the delay.“We can’t keep going through this – five times in three years. Many business owners would have walked away a long time ago,”"" he said. The EA said it had paused work until the spring, pending the agreement of an affordable price with a supplier. It said affordability of the scheme was a ""key challenge"" but that it had not given up. Despite the challenges, Mr Goodall said he has been able to keep going because of the support from the community, which included the ""amazing"" response to the viral video.""They allow you to carry on even though you’re tired, cold and wet… you get your self-esteem back and away you go,"" he said.

Balvinder Singh Gill said he felt ""really optimistic"" when he moved to Oxford from his home town of Coventry, but it became a ""nightmare"".The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.Mr Gill said there needed to be ""proper financial redress"" for those affected. Newly married and starting his business on Oxford's Cowley Road in 2003, he said ""from the very start"" he though there was something wrong with the Horizon system. ""I had a background in maths and computer science so I thought I was quite savvy with IT,"" he said.""Figures were not coming correct from as early as I can remember, but the shortfalls got bigger and bigger over time."" Mr Gill said he paid the shortfalls back by ""robbing Peter to feed Paul"" using money from the retail side of his business to compensate the shortfall from the Post Office.He assumed the money would come back in the form of an ""error notice"", which never came.""Three times I have been sectioned for mental health,"" he said.""Most of the decade after it happened I was hounded literally every month for money from them against this debt.""They had civil proceedings to try and secure the debt against me.""In the first decade, we were so poor, I was giving them 30% of what I earned, you were never means tested.""I remember having to take [short-term] Wonga loans, not having petrol to go to work.""I had a young family, I had a picture of how I thought my life was going to be and I had worked hard to make that happen - maybe in a parallel universe, certainly not this one, it has not been that.""

On Friday, at Sheffield Crown Court, Pur, of no fixed address, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Pur was found guilty of sexual assault of a child under 13 following a four-day trial earlier this month. Jurors heard the attack happened in the girl's bedroom in June 2023. After the assault, Pur had told the girl not to tell anyone, the court heard. When confronted by the girl's father, he denied anything had happened, jurors were told. Sentencing, Judge Graham Reeds KC stated Pur had lied throughout the case, adding the victim should have been safe in her own home. After the hearing, Det Con Amy Blakey praised the ""tremendous courage"" of the victim. She added: ""It is thanks to her bravery and the incredible strength of her family that a dangerous man is now behind bars. ""Nothing can reverse the trauma and harm caused by this serious assault, but I hope that the result brings the victim and her family a certain level of closure."" In addition to the jail term, Pur was issued a lifelong sexual harm prevention order, placed on the sex offenders register and told he must serve an additional year on licence after his release.

""Ever since then, I've always loved going, I've always wanted to start my own."" Raising money for charity, My Aylmer said he then decided to put performances in his garden, which included a marquee which he and his friends had ""covered with fabric"".

""I wrote the founder Nell Gifford a letter and posted it through one of their box offices."" Mr Aylmer eventually took up two apprenticeships and toured with the company in 2022 before deciding to head off to Bath Spa University to study theatre production. It's there that he decided to write the play about the shows he put on with his friends in his garden. ""It's a story I've wanted to write for quite a while,"" he said.

The Chelsea midfielder told BBC Sport about one description of her performance after a game, which said: ""'Fran played really well, what a game, but she looked big today'"". ""I had countless comments about having big thighs and how strong my legs look,"" Daisy, 21, tells BBC Newsbeat. ""When you're that young, you do start to worry. I thought I don't want to wear leggings because then everyone can see the shape of my legs."" For 21-year-old Charlotte, comments about her body didn't put her off playing football, ""but it definitely made me a lot more conscious of what I ate"". ""It's quite a common thing around girls' football. It's definitely not a shock to hear what she [Fran] said."" Daisy, who plays for Stourbridge FC in Birmingham, feels there has always been a perception that a female footballer needs to look a certain way. ""But what they look like does not affect their ability to be a good footballer."" She thinks there's a deeper issue around the comparison of males and females in sport. ""I went to a school where girls weren't allowed to play football. It was specifically the boys do football, the girls do netball,"" she says. Charlotte, who played for Birmingham City's development teams throughout her childhood, thinks there's a perception about ""an ideal type of athlete"". ""And how they look, but obviously women's bodies are very different. ""I don't think it's ever going to be the same as that. There's always different types, shapes and sizes in women's football."" As Chelsea's record goal-scorer, Kirby explains she now has ""no fear"" raising these issues because she's an experienced international. ""I have been around long enough to suffer my own abuse growing up and seeing it on social media - you don't become accustomed to it, though, and there's still things you read."" She has received messages from other players raising concerns for their team-mates, who they believe are struggling with body image issues. And while ""there is not one answer"" on how to deal with it as ""everyone is different"", she does feel support is important. Daisy feels having ""a support circle"" can helpful. ""There are a lot of people who struggle in football, a lot of people who say there's not enough support."" ""The way that will get better is by people talking and speaking up and saying how the game could be improved, how the support could be improved."" Charlotte says turning to those closest to you can be an option. ""For months when I was struggling with it, I don't think I spoke to coaches for about three or four months into the season. ""Your coach is going to care when you come up to them and speak to them about it,"" Charlotte says. ""Speak to people, especially friends, they're all going to be there for you.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-67924096,Barton House: Bristol residents to return home next month,Tower block residents forced to leave their homes almost two months ago should be able to return next month.,2024-01-10,"Tower block residents forced to leave their homes almost two months ago should be able to return next month. More than 250 residents at Barton House in Bristol were evacuated from the building on 14 November because of safety concerns over the concrete. Bristol City Council said work to secure the safety of the building started on Monday and is expected to be complete by 23 February. Those affected will then be able to move back into the building. High Rise Housing: Forced to Leave If you want to find out more about the Bristol tower block residents evacuated from their homes due to safety concerns watch 'High Rise Housing: Forced to Leave' now on BBC iPlayer (UK only). However at a meeting earlier, the city council was handed a petition signed by residents from 42 flats saying they would not move back in as they do not feel safe. Student Fatima said she feels residents ""haven't received enough information"" to be able to feel safe and said the council had ""completely downplayed the whole situation"". She said: ""Most of the children have trauma. Now, all the kids, the mums, everyone is worried about going back in there. ""We don't feel safe. It's really scary."" Fellow resident Shaban Ali said it was not the news people were hoping for and while ""some"" people wanted to move back into Barton House, the council ""don't understand how we feel as parents to go back into the building"". He added: ""Just two months ago we were told that the building is not safe and we got evacuated almost in the middle of the night. Just two months after, with barely any work carried out in my opinion, we're basically being told to go back. ""There's a lot of things that just aren't adding up in my mind,"" he added. During the meeting, residents were given more information relating to the initial concerns that led to the evacuation in November. This included potentially missing structural ties which connected the floors and the walls, and a concrete cover, which protects the building's metal reinforcement, potentially being too thin. Officers said the structural ties had now been identified as being in place and in good order. Further investigations of the concrete cover found the thickness to be generally good throughout the building. The council said a layer of blockwork or cement was also placed where the cover was at its thinnest, adding additional protection. Other work includes adding additional fire proofing in 42 flats, a central alarm system to the whole block and checking for legionella bacteria in the water system. The council said that 21 out of 98 flats at Barton House were currently occupied, with over half of the residents still living in hotels. Others are staying with family and friends. Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said the council ""continues to move at pace to make the block safe"". ""We are now in a place where we can have a high level of confidence that the structure of Barton House is safer than we thought back in November, but not yet safe for residents to return,"" he said. Mr Rees said this confidence comes from the ""detailed work"" carried out by engineers ""to survey the block across a number of key locations"". ""We remain grateful to all Barton House residents for continuing to support our efforts and allowing us the opportunity to carry out these essential works, and to everyone who is continuing to support affected tenants,"" he added. In November, Bristol City Council said surveys had shown three out of the 98 flats were structurally compromised. It said concrete had not been attached properly when the tower was built in 1958 and added the block was not constructed according to design plans. A report in December found issues were only present in some parts of the building, but ""essential work"" had to be completed before residents could return.

The 393ft (120m) King's Tower will replace the empty Primark building on the High Street. Its 40 storeys will contain 428 ""co-living"" studio units mostly aimed at students. A Sheffield City Council planning meeting heard the developer had agreed to contribute £75,000 for improvements at the Castle Square tram stop. Planning officers said co-living was a new concept where residents live in small studios and share communal living and dining areas. Shared units on each floor will have a large family room including a kitchen and dining area, TV/gaming room, work and study room, guest toilets, storage and a unit for overnight guests. Residents will also be able to use workspaces, cycle stores, private meeting and dining rooms, cinema/presentation rooms, as well as a gym, bar and lounges. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the tower will also have commercial units on the ground floor. The existing building has stood empty since the fashion retailer moved out seven years ago and will be demolished as part of the redevelopment. Labour councillor Peter Price said the development would help meet the ""growth in popularity in city centre living"". ""It helps to meet this dilemma we have trying to provide 30,000 new homes in this city and unless we build upwards, we're going to be building on more green spaces and the greenbelt,"" he said. ""This type of venture is a way forward."" Councillors raised concerns about potential overheating due to the amount of glass that would be used during construction, the number of co-living spaces in a 40-storey building and the potential lack of extractors in individual kitchens. The project was approved with one vote against and two abstentions. It would be the second tallest building in Yorkshire, just behind the 45-storey Cirrus Point, currently in development in Leeds which is set to stand at 436ft (133m).

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England

Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death. The Bibby Stockholm, which became fully operational in October, has been chartered by the government to hold about 500 people while their asylum claims are processed. The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good. ''He said he was treated very badly there. One egg in the morning. 'They treat us like animals', he said,"" she told the agency. Mr Farruku's cousin, Marenglen Farruku, also told Reuters: ""He went there for a better life. ""He never showed any sign of distress. There are so many unanswered questions what has happened there.""

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed.

A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"".

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Fifteen-month-old Olly Stopforth, from Frodsham, died two days after being discharged from the Countess of Chester Hospital in March 2020. He had a streptococcal infection, which led to sepsis and a viral infection. A jury inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court found medics could have saved him if tests had been carried out. In a statement read out by the coroner the hospital trust said it had improved since Olly's death and was now using the national guidelines on sepsis testing. A solicitor for Olly's parents, Laura and Karl Stopforth, said it had been ""incredibly painful and difficult"" for them to hear from hospital professionals that more should have been done to properly diagnose and treat their son. They felt their son was ""not considered as a priority when he was in hospital"" and they had been ""very upset to hear that the medical staff trusted with their little boy's care did not provide him with adequate medical attention"". ""No parent should lose their young child as they have, it is especially painful because they lost their beautiful boy in preventable circumstances,"" the solicitor added, saying the family would be pursuing a medical negligence claim against the trust. The inquest jury accepted the Covid-19 pandemic had made things harder for staff during the time when Olly was being treated. It heard that hospital staff were under pressure because the pandemic had just started and they were unsure about how it would affect children or how long patients should be kept in hospital. But the jury found the baby was not adequately cared for at the hospital, as doctors thought he only had a viral infection and did not carry out tests that could have shown he was suffering from the more serious bacterial infection. Olly was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital after becoming ill at home and a video consultation with a GP who suspected he had a viral infection. One of the paramedics who took him to hospital thought Olly had ""grossly abnormal"" signs and was ""very poorly"", as he had a rash, a high temperature and a high heart rate. Olly remained at the Accident and Emergency Department for nearly six hours before being transferred to a ward, and was discharged four hours later. His mum Laura found him dead in bed two days later. A consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester, Dr Alison Timmis, told the inquest no steps had been taken to rule out a bacterial infection. She agreed that if Olly had been given antibiotics it was ""very likely"" he would have survived. An expert witness told the inquest she did not understand why a sepsis screening tool had not been used at the hospital. Another expert, microbiologist Prof Vav Cartwright, said in a statement: ""Almost any intravenous antibiotic or antibiotic combination likely to have been employed would have been highly active against streptococcus."" ""On the balance of probabilities Olly would have required a two-week course of antibiotics, after which he would have made a full recovery,"" she added. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said it was her sincere hope the trust had learnt serious lessons. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

Janine Powell, now 52, was wrongfully accused of stealing £74,000 from her branch in Tiverton, Devon. She was sacked and arrested, before being convicted at a trial in Exeter in 2008. She maintained her innocence but was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving five months. Ms Powell said the hardest part of her wrongful jailing had been leaving her children. ""You're stuck behind these four walls in a little room,"" she said. ""You get phone calls to find out what's happening outside with the children. ""I've missed out on doing things with them - I can't get that back."" The Post Office Horizon scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. What happened between 1999 and 2015 is now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. After Ms Powell was released from prison, she spent a further three months wearing a tag. She moved away from Tiverton, but said she could not escape feelings of guilt on her visits back to Devon. ""Even though people were being nice to you, saying 'I know you didn't do it', you know that as soon as you walk away, they're talking about it, saying that you've done it,"" she said. ""You feel guilty."" Some sub-postmasters, like Ms Powell, wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy - and some have since died. The Metropolitan Police is investigating possible fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the Horizon scandal - to which Ms Powell has given evidence - is continuing. The government is now facing increasing calls to bring forward emergency legislation to deal with the scandal and ministers said they would introduce plans to speed up the process ""shortly"". The former Justice Secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, said: ""Perhaps there should be a presumption that all those people who were convicted are in fact not guilty. ""We could go further and simply quash the convictions and render them absolutely void, so that then we're in a position whereby the sort of complications that are hitting the compensation process can be avoided."" Ms Powell's conviction was quashed, along with many others in 2022. She says, for her, details of compensation are not the issue. What she most wants is for the Post Office to ""hold their hands up"" and ""admit they were wrong"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. Allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank, an inquest into his death heard. There is no evidence to suggest Mr Atkinson alerted staff to his allergy. The 23-year-old, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary an hour after ingesting peanuts. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen section of Dadyal's food safety management documents was blank. Mr Atkinson's flatmate, Luke Isley, previously gave evidence saying that the Newcastle University graduate had raised concerns about what he was eating as little as 30 seconds after beginning to eat his pizza, which sparked panic among his friends when he mentioned peanuts. By the time paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"", according to Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, who said he was ""profoundly unconscious"" by the time he was helped downstairs. He died in hospital less than an hour later. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts.

The proposed Exmouth station, to include a public inquiry desk, was given £5m funding in June 2023. But Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez, said a survey delay was ""driving her batty"". East Devon District Council confirmed bats had held up surveys and planning application processing. A spokesperson added: ""As the proposal involves demolishing the existing police station, further wildlife surveys are required to confirm if there are any legally protected species in the building that would be affected. ""On-site surveys cannot currently take place, as this may disturb hibernating bats, with surveys usually done from around April onwards. ""Until the impact of this demolition is understood, and suggestions to reduce any impacts are provided, the council is not allowed to grant planning permission."" It said the council had offered ""pre-application advice"" for a fee, so other elements such as design and impacts on highways and surrounding buildings, need not be impacted by the delay. Ms Hernandez previously said the station site would be redeveloped and a modern facility built for officers and staff. This week on social media she said: ""Bats stall my office's planning application for the new Exmouth Police Station. ""I have to wait until roosting season May-Sept to carry out a survey before East Devon District Council will even register the planning application. It's driving me batty! Can't blame the bats though."" The closure of the station to the public in 2015 was criticised but it has remained an operational base.

Residents spoke to the BBC as the country continues to reel from what has been dubbed the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. It played its ""own little part in that history,"" said Kate Carless, the hall's current treasurer, with the village attracting visitors, some even stopping to take selfies outside the hall. ""I'm no longer the bookings secretary for the village hall, I'm more like its agent at the moment,"" Ms Carless adds. It is here where between 30 and 40 ex sub-postmasters and mistresses met for the first time one Sunday in 2009 - a gathering that led to the creation of the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) campaign group. The occasion was the first time many of them discovered they weren't alone in having fallen victim to the bugs in an accounting system called Horizon. The man who orchestrated that meeting was Alan Bates - now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - for fraudulent activity, based on information from Horizon. Many, including Mr Bates, maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues about errors in the accounting software. But some went to prison for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined, and some even took their own lives or died before getting a chance to clear their names. However, despite the avalanche of new publicity around the scandal, only 93 of them have had their convictions overturned. Now, a fresh police investigation into the Post Office and the way it pursued the cases has been launched, with 50 new potential victims coming forward. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells is also handing back her CBE with immediate effect, after a petition exceeded a million signatures. The TV drama and subsequent publicity has now really ""put the village in the spotlight,"" said Ms Carless. ""We've had people driving past the village hall quite slowly taking photos,"" she said. ""But it's a shame it has had to get to this for those people that have been affected. ""When you started watching the drama you were thinking how could this have happened to people."" In the drama Mr Bates, played by Toby Jones, can be seen seemingly choosing somewhere random for affected sub-postmasters to meet. ""Putting that pin into the map seems to have ignited both the residents and other people, who know that I live here, to get in touch,"" said village hall trustee Keith Hicks. He said he had heard of people taking selfies outside the hall, ""which seems quite amazing"". The hall wasn't used in the filming of the drama, he explained, ""but I can appreciate with the parking issues around here that it wouldn't be easy to bring a production team in"". He said he didn't remember the meeting in 2009, describing it as ""very low key"". ""It wasn't until I listened to the BBC Radio 4 podcast, The Great Post Office Trial, that I realised the significance that this little hall had played in the whole story,"" he said. ""These people were the life and soul of the community and then they were damned by the Post Office without any thought that they may be right. ""The fact that they came together here in the very first place, and realised that they weren't single entities, I think it's very significant."" Other local residents said they had also been amazed at the part their village played in the story. ""When you see him look at the map it's just amazing to think that they came here - it's a proud moment for the little people,"" said Alan Booth.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67939205,New Post Office law 'a step in the right direction',A man caught up in the Post Office scandal with his wife says a proposed new law to exonerate victims is a step in the right direction.,2024-01-10,"A man caught up in the Post Office scandal with his wife says a proposed new law to exonerate victims is a step in the right direction. Michael Rudkin's wife Susan was wrongly convicted of stealing money, while he lost his job and union position. The couple, who are featured in an ITV drama about the scandal, ran a branch in Leicestershire. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said new legislation will ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". The Post Office  prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from IT system Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Sunak announced on Wednesday victims would be able to sign a form to say they were innocent in order to have their convictions overturned and claim compensation. Mr Rudkin, who was played by Shaun Dooley in Mr Bates vs the Post Office, ran the Ibstock branch of the Post Office with his wife. Mrs Rudkin, who is too upset to speak publicly at the moment, was convicted of losing £44,000, given a suspended sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours community service while being electronically tagged. Her husband said: ""If you could even remotely think of what hell would look like, then multiply that by 10, that is how our lives have been the last 15 years, absolute hell. ""It doesn't get much worse than your wife contemplating suicide."" Reacting to the announcement of new legislation, Mr Rudkin said: ""I was pleased [by] the overall principle of making sure that everybody has this blanket overturning of convictions because they've waited far too long for this. ""On top of which, to be compensated, let's see what the detail is. ""It feels as though we're heading in the right direction. After 20 years, I hasten to add."" His wife's conviction was overturned in April 2021 but people's perception of them as a couple did not change dramatically, Mr Rudkin previously told the BBC. However, since the programme - which put the scandal in the spotlight - was broadcast people who he had not spoken to in 20 years have been getting in touch. Mr Rudkin added: ""From feeling castigated throughout your community and your friends... all of a sudden, I'm getting messages from people who I haven't spoken to for 20 years saying 'we saw the programme, we didn't realise. So sorry'."" He said he now wants recompense for their loss of earnings and compensation. The couple dismissed a previous compensation offer which Mr Rudkin called ""obscene"". A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both Post Office and government are committed to providing full, fair and final compensation for the people affected. ""To date, offers of compensation totalling more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 postmasters, the majority of which have been agreed and paid.""

Ako Hussain Pur, 32, had been hired to carry out building work at the home in Sheffield, prosecutors said. On Friday, at Sheffield Crown Court, Pur, of no fixed address, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Pur was found guilty of sexual assault of a child under 13 following a four-day trial earlier this month. Jurors heard the attack happened in the girl's bedroom in June 2023. After the assault, Pur had told the girl not to tell anyone, the court heard. When confronted by the girl's father, he denied anything had happened, jurors were told. Sentencing, Judge Graham Reeds KC stated Pur had lied throughout the case, adding the victim should have been safe in her own home. After the hearing, Det Con Amy Blakey praised the ""tremendous courage"" of the victim. She added: ""It is thanks to her bravery and the incredible strength of her family that a dangerous man is now behind bars. ""Nothing can reverse the trauma and harm caused by this serious assault, but I hope that the result brings the victim and her family a certain level of closure."" In addition to the jail term, Pur was issued a lifelong sexual harm prevention order, placed on the sex offenders register and told he must serve an additional year on licence after his release.

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now."" She said there were many people who ""thoroughly and richly deserve these awards"" but the system was ""devalued"" by others. ""The fact is the honours is broken and needs a complete overhaul by No 10 and onwards to the monarch who rubber stamps what happens,"" she said. ""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said. ""I'm a tiny voice in all of this but I just wanted to stand in solidarity with these people who I can't even begin to comprehend what they've been through."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X  and Facebook.

https://www.bbc.com/news/education-48993830,GCSE grades 2023: The 9-1 boundaries explained,Students in England and Wales who took GCSE exams in November will receive their results on Thursday.,2024-01-10,"Students in England and Wales who took GCSE exams in November will receive their results on Thursday. In England, most students who took exams in November will have been resitting English or maths. Their GCSEs will be graded using a numerical system from 9 to 1. Exams are graded differently in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland has a separate qualifications system to the rest of the UK, with no GCSEs. Senior examiners decide the minimum marks needed for each grade. In England, the summer 2023 grade boundaries were published via the following links for the different exam boards: The main exam board for Wales, WJEC, also published grade boundaries on its website. For those taking GCSEs in Northern Ireland, broad subject grade boundaries were published on the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA) website and the grade boundaries for specific papers were published here. The 9-1 grading scheme was brought in alongside an overhaul of the curriculum in England in 2014. The rollout began in 2017 with three subjects - English language, English literature and maths - being the first to be graded in numbers. By 2020, all subjects were using the new grading system. The highest grade is now 9, while 1 is the lowest. The U grade, meaning ""ungraded"", remains the same. The number scale is not directly equivalent to the old letter one. However, the two scales do meet in certain places: Exams watchdog Ofqual has said fewer grade 9s will have been awarded than A*s ""to identify exceptional performance"". Pupils will have needed a 4 for a ""standard pass"" and 5 for a ""strong pass"". This means that a candidate who gets nine grade-4s has, technically, passed all their exams. However, the government's school league tables are based on the percentage of pupils who achieve a 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs. Many sixth forms insist on a minimum number of 5s or 6s as a condition of entry for further study. The numerical grading scheme was introduced as part of a 2014 curriculum overhaul by then-education secretary, Michael Gove. It put less emphasis on GCSE coursework than before, with grades in almost all subjects decided in final exams. The qualifications were designed to be more challenging, with exams taken after two years of study. Previously pupils covered the syllabus through a series of modules with regular assessments throughout the course. At the time of the changes, the government argued that the new scale ""recognises more clearly the achievements of high-attaining students, as the additional grades allow for greater differentiation"". It also said that the move from letters to numbers would make it clear - for example to an employer - ""whether a student has taken a new, more challenging GCSE, or an old reformed GCSE"". Grades have changed in Northern Ireland too. In summer 2019, the CCEA introduced a new nine-category grade scale - A* to G, including a C*. Students may also get results with grades 9-1 if they take exams set by English boards. The Welsh government introduced new and revised GCSE courses in September 2015. The most significant changes were in English language, Welsh language and mathematics. Wales retained the letter-based grading structure A*- G.","['Exams', 'Wales', 'Young people', 'GCSEs', 'England']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7B05/production/_126039413_gettyimages-838244114.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/86AE/production/_130887443_new_gcse_grading_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/49B5/production/_125996881_6e2e4f7d-c67f-4626-bd44-429287959a41.jpg']",,UK,England

Conservative MP for Woking Jonathan Lord said he had ""lost count"" of how many times he had raised the issue in letters or in the House of Commons. The Post Office prosecuted 736 people based on information from faulty IT system Horizon between 1999 and 2015. It said it was ""deeply sorry"" and was trying to right the wrongs of the past. The Ministry of Justice has been contacted for a comment. Ex-Royal Mail CEO Adam Crozier said: ""I would like to express my heartfelt sympathies to the individuals and families who were so wronged by the tragic miscarriages of justice."" ""While I did not have any involvement in the Horizon issue during my time at Royal Mail, I feel deeply sorry for those whose lives were ruined by what happened,"" he added. During Mr Crozier's time there, the Post Office was owned by the Royal Mail but had its own governance system. Many sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses maintained their innocence and said they raised issues about the software, but some went to prison for false accounting and theft. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government would bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the Post Office scandal. Former Post Office boss Paula Vennells said she would hand back her CBE after mounting pressure regarding the impact of Horizon, which was manufactured by technology company Fujitsu. Mr Lord said: ""Clearly that is not going to be enough given the scale of the issues that have been uncovered and the way that the Post Office and Fujitsu behaved over so many years. ""Obviously people want to see justice here and people who are seriously at fault to face the music for this.""

Shropshire Council is considering making changes to Shrewsbury Sports Village and the plans are due to go before its cabinet next week. The plans also include poolside seating for 250 spectators, new reception and soft play areas, a new gym and a dance studio. A council report said the changes would allow swimming galas to be held. The proposals include the creation of a 25m (82ft), eight-lane pool at the centre on Sundorne Road, with another 17m (55ft) by 10m (32ft) studio pool, which would feature a moveable floor for learners and other water sports. They suggest the larger pool would be able to accommodate up to 250 competitors. Robert Macey, the council's cabinet member responsible for culture, said he was keen to hear people's views on the ""exciting project"", which he said would bring ""regional competitions and swimming galas to our sites"". He stressed that the plans had no implications on decisions that are due to be made on the future of the Quarry Swimming and Fitness Centre in the town centre. Plans for a rebuild of that pool and a new one at Shrewsbury Sports Village were put on hold in 2022, to prioritise a plan for a £12.1m pool and leisure development in Whitchurch.

The DfE has chosen nine London schools with ""excellent attendance"" rates to share ideas with others across England. It is also establishing a £15m scheme offering ""direct support"" to persistently absent pupils and their families across England. An advertising campaign has been set up to coincide with the scheme. Called ""Moments Matter, Attendance Counts"", the adverts aim to outline the importance of attendance for attainment, wellbeing and development, as well as signposting parents and carers to support. The latest figures on repeated absence at schools in the capital only run to the spring term of 2023, but new figures are due to be released in March. It comes as the Labour Party announced this week it would set up more breakfast clubs to address persistent absences. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: ""The benefits of our success in raising education standards can only be when all children are in school. ""Tackling attendance is my number-one priority.

""Every year I try to do something harder,"" said Mr Downes, who is also a Liberal Democrat councillor in Otley. ""I’ve done the Three Peaks three times in a row, and that took me about 30-odd hours.""Now I want to do them four times and I don't think that's ever been done before  - not continuously."" Mr Downes plans to take up the 100-mile challenge in September as he turns 60.The Three Peaks of Whernside, Ingleborough and Pen-y-ghent are a popular draw for walkers and tourists.""I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro on my 50th birthday,"" he said.""This isn't Kilimanjaro, but it's probably just as much of a challenge.""Mr Downes was just a short sprint away from his front door when he suddenly collapsed in the street and stopped breathing for 20 minutes in January 2016.He later learned that four passers-by had rushed to his aid and helped save his life, before he was airlifted to hospital, where he woke up three days later.It transpired the cardiac arrest was caused by an undiagnosed hereditary condition which meant his body could not handle processed meat.""If it had happened a minute later I’d have been through my front door,"" Mr Downes said.""My wife was at work at the time and I wouldn’t be here now to tell the story."" He said: ""I’d had a blood clot, the size of which would normally pass through anybody without issue.""But because my arteries were so narrow, the blood couldn’t get through, so my heart packed up.""After a triple bypass operation, Mr Downes was told by his surgeon he could safely return to intense physical exercise.Though he acknowledges he has unusually high levels of stamina and a resting heart rate in the mid-30s, he claims he is living proof that most people can become ultra marathon runners.He said: ""I’m not the fittest guy in the world. It just requires a lot of determination and mental strength, but you need to get the nutrition right as well.""Unless you have a medical condition which stops you, anyone can do it. ""Part of the reason I do these things is because I think I’m so lucky to be here.

The city joins London and Birmingham as contenders for the event - once known as the Gay Olympics - which was held in Hong Kong and Guadalajara last year. The Federation of Gay Games (FGG) announced the longlist of cities in with a chance to host the week-long sporting and culture event. The winner will be announced in Valencia in November 2025, it said. Each city now has two years to put a bid together detailing the sports they plan to host, facilities they plan to use, and how it would be funded. The FGG said the event is an opportunity to invite more than 10,000 LGBTQ+ participants and allies to the region, and would have ""significant economic impact"". Other cities included in the list are Melbourne, Miami, San Diego, Frankfurt, Cape Town and Vancouver. Andi Herring, of the Liverpool City Region Pride Foundation, said: ""Our commitment to making Liverpool City Region the most LGBT+ friendly region in the UK has gone from strength to strength in the past five years, combined with the region's rich sporting history and renowned reputation worldwide makes the city region a fitting host."" Harry Doyle, Liverpool City Council's cabinet member for health, wellbeing and culture, said: ""We're always looking ahead to what events we can host in Liverpool and the wider city region, and we're delighted to support LCR Pride in throwing our hat in the ring to host the Gay Games. ""We're a city committed to embracing all communities, and hosting the most successful Eurovision ever showcased how we - on a global stage - excel when it comes to fostering diversity, combining it with creativity and scouse flair."" He added there was a long way to go but he was looking forward to making their bid ""stand out"". The Gay Games was the brainchild of Tom Waddell, a US Olympic decathlete who wanted to share the spirit of the Games for his community. IT was first held in San Francisco in 1982 and has since been held in Vancouver, New York, Amsterdam, Sydney, Chicago, Cologne, Cleveland+Akron, Paris, Hong Kong and Guadalajara, Last year marked the first time in its 41-year history that the event was shared between two regions - Asia and Latin America - as Hong Kong and the Mexican city of Guadalajara acted as co-hosts.

Speaking to BBC Hereford & Worcester, Mr Sauntson said he was walking his dog close to the racecourse when he heard a shout and saw Mr McGarva waving.He climbed the steps onto the bridge and saw that he was trying to help a woman who was face down in the water. Mr Sauntson said: “We didn’t know at that stage whether she was still alive or not. The guy [Mr McGarva] got in and I held onto the rope. The good news was he managed to turn her over and she was still alive.“All my effort then was on pulling the rope to get them both back in. The other guy and I grabbed an arm each and we pulled her to safety.” The pair then waited with the woman and took care of her before the paramedics arrived.Mr Sauntson, from Worcester, said it was “natural instinct” that caused him to help save the woman.“The relief was unbelievable - seeing her face and being able to talk to her, knowing she was still alive,” he added. Mr McGarva had previously told the BBC about the incident and how he had tried throwing her the ring but she was not grabbing it.""So I've had to go further down stream, swim into the water, and when she's coming down, I've caught her [and] got her onto the ring,” he said.""Luckily, there was a gent here that was also helping pull us both out of the water.""

A subsidiary of Essar Oil plans to build HyNet's new hub at the Stanlow Manufacturing Complex in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. Cheshire West and Chester Council planning committee gave the project the green light at a meeting on Tuesday. The firm said it was ""delighted"". Project manager Richard Holden said the facility would produce enough carbon to power a city the size of Liverpool. ""In doing so we will capture over two million tonnes a year of carbon dioxide which is the equivalent of taking one million cars off UK roads,"" he said. The proposals include the demolition of structures on the Stanlow oil refinery. However, questions were raised in the meeting over the technology's green credentials, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. While hydrogen itself is considered a clean fuel, the process of making it usable also requires energy. This energy can either use renewable sources like wind, water or solar, known as green hydrogen, or natural gas, with the resulting carbon emissions captured and stored underground, known as blue hydrogen. Councillor John Roach said he believed the application should be refused as it would hinder the government's pledge to be net zero by 2050. He said many experts regard blue hydrogen production as a ""dirty technology"" and ""offers no solution to the climate crisis"". HyNet project director David Parkin said the facility owned by Essar Energy Transition Hydrogen will be ""the UK's first large scale, low carbon hydrogen production facility, placing the North West region at the forefront of the UK's journey towards net zero carbon emissions"". He said it would also create new jobs, protect existing roles and attract investment. Under the plans, low carbon hydrogen will be produced at the site by 2027.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67934705,Brent: Plans to expand mortuary to meet need for storage,A north London hospital could have its mortuary expanded to tackle a growing need for storage.,2024-01-10,"A north London hospital could have its mortuary expanded to tackle a growing need for storage. Brent Mortuary, at Northwick Park Hospital, is running out of space due to more deaths being investigated and increases in the length of stay for the deceased. To resolve the issue, Brent Council is seeking to increase its capacity. Krupa Sheth, from the council, said the £2.63m expansion would ensure the mortuary meets its legal requirements. The mortuary covers Brent, Harrow and Barnet - three of the five boroughs within the HM Coroner of North London's jurisdiction. In 2021, a Human Tissue Authority (HTA) audit found the site no longer met its requirement for ""sufficient storage"". It must have adequate refrigerated and frozen storage for the deceased and enough space to allow for peak periods during yearly seasonal pressures. The issue was put down to annual increases in the number of deaths being investigated by the coroner and the rise in average length of stay for each deceased, as well as the area's steadily growing population size and age. It is also expected that the cost-of-living crisis will make the situation worse, as families struggle to find enough money for funeral costs, increasing the length of time the deceased may need to stay in the mortuary. The service is also seeing a steady increase in the number of obesity-related deaths, which the council said ""can often require additional storage space"". If nothing was done, Brent, Harrow and Barnet Councils could be fined for not meeting HTA requirements. The council said it planned to expand the capacity by 80 places using an unused cellar room next to the existing mortuary. The three councils would be responsible for their own financial contributions, based on their population sizes. Barnet would pay more than £1m, Harrow would pay almost £700,000 and Brent would pay about £900,000. Labour councillor Ms Sheth, Brent Council's member for infrastructure, said the council was committed ""to ensuring the continued security and dignity in the ongoing care of the deceased"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crgjppmyd1go,Landowner renews battle over Dartmoor wild camping,,2024-01-10,"A Dartmoor landowner has won the right to appeal to the Supreme Court against a ruling allowing wild camping in the national park.Alexander Darwall's appeal follows a victory by right to roam campaigners last July when judges allowed wild camping.Landmark Chambers, representing Mr Darwall, said the appeal ""will determine once and for all this important issue, external, namely whether members of the public enjoy a right to camp on the Dartmoor commons"".Campaigners The Stars are for Everyone said the ""egregious move illustrates the need for greater legal protections for access to nature"". The court battle goes back to January last year when Mr Darwall, a hedge fund manager who owns a 4,000 acre (16 sq km) estate on Dartmoor, won a High Court challenge against wild camping.The victory led to thousands of people protesting and sparked a nationwide debate on public access in the English countryside.At the centre of this case was whether wild camping can be considered open-air recreation, which is allowed in the park under the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985.Lewis Winks of The Stars are for Everyone, said taking it to the Supreme Court was the ""final battle for the protection of historic rights to wild camp on Dartmoor"". He said: ""It is tying up the resources of the national park authority that could be better spent on education and getting more people outdoors and into this amazing environment.“I just hope that the court sees sense and ensures that wild camping remains as a part of enjoying Dartmoor.“Whatever the outcome it has galvanised huge amounts of support and we want to see the next government be bold and protect access to the countryside.”Environmental campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: ""The fact that a wealthy landowner is repeatedly seeking to extinguish the public’s right to responsibly wild camp on Dartmoor is a perfect demonstration of why we need new access legislation.""Dr Kevin Bishop, chief executive of Dartmoor National Park Authority, said: ""Naturally, we feel disappointed by the decision to allow the appeal. ""We’ve been consistently clear about our role in protecting Dartmoor and promoting understanding so people respect the National Park’s environment, its cultural heritage and those who live and work here.""Since this matter was brought to the courts, we have sought to defend the public’s right to access the National Park for open air recreation while continuing our work with partners that protect Dartmoor’s unique characteristics.""Mr Darwall has been approached for comment.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death. The Bibby Stockholm, which became fully operational in October, has been chartered by the government to hold about 500 people while their asylum claims are processed. The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good. ''He said he was treated very badly there. One egg in the morning. 'They treat us like animals', he said,"" she told the agency. Mr Farruku's cousin, Marenglen Farruku, also told Reuters: ""He went there for a better life. ""He never showed any sign of distress. There are so many unanswered questions what has happened there."" An imam chanted prayers and family members cried out as Mr Farruku's coffin was lowered into a grave, Reuters reported. Mr Farruku's roommate, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, has told BBC News other barge residents might harm themselves if conditions on board did not improve. He said there had been complaints about poor quality food, cold showers, unreliable wi-fi and concerns not being dealt with. He said: ""They're saying Leonard's death is just the beginning. ""They are trying to give a warning. That place is not good for them. Every day their stress is increasing, getting worse."" In a statement, the Home Office said it took the welfare of barge residents ""very seriously"" and had ""rigorous safeguarding processes in place"". ""Any concerns raised about the service delivered on the barge are swiftly addressed through our work with the provider, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year,"" it added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-67934233,"Brighton doctors could have saved student, documents reveal","A student's life could have been saved had doctors acted sooner, NHS documents seen by BBC Newsnight reveal.",2024-01-10,"A student's life could have been saved had doctors acted sooner, NHS documents seen by BBC Newsnight reveal. Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Fifteen-month-old Olly Stopforth, from Frodsham, died two days after being discharged from the Countess of Chester Hospital in March 2020. He had a streptococcal infection, which led to sepsis and a viral infection. A jury inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court found medics could have saved him if tests had been carried out. In a statement read out by the coroner the hospital trust said it had improved since Olly's death and was now using the national guidelines on sepsis testing. A solicitor for Olly's parents, Laura and Karl Stopforth, said it had been ""incredibly painful and difficult"" for them to hear from hospital professionals that more should have been done to properly diagnose and treat their son. They felt their son was ""not considered as a priority when he was in hospital"" and they had been ""very upset to hear that the medical staff trusted with their little boy's care did not provide him with adequate medical attention"". ""No parent should lose their young child as they have, it is especially painful because they lost their beautiful boy in preventable circumstances,"" the solicitor added, saying the family would be pursuing a medical negligence claim against the trust. The inquest jury accepted the Covid-19 pandemic had made things harder for staff during the time when Olly was being treated. It heard that hospital staff were under pressure because the pandemic had just started and they were unsure about how it would affect children or how long patients should be kept in hospital. But the jury found the baby was not adequately cared for at the hospital, as doctors thought he only had a viral infection and did not carry out tests that could have shown he was suffering from the more serious bacterial infection. Olly was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital after becoming ill at home and a video consultation with a GP who suspected he had a viral infection. One of the paramedics who took him to hospital thought Olly had ""grossly abnormal"" signs and was ""very poorly"", as he had a rash, a high temperature and a high heart rate. Olly remained at the Accident and Emergency Department for nearly six hours before being transferred to a ward, and was discharged four hours later. His mum Laura found him dead in bed two days later. A consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester, Dr Alison Timmis, told the inquest no steps had been taken to rule out a bacterial infection. She agreed that if Olly had been given antibiotics it was ""very likely"" he would have survived. An expert witness told the inquest she did not understand why a sepsis screening tool had not been used at the hospital. Another expert, microbiologist Prof Vav Cartwright, said in a statement: ""Almost any intravenous antibiotic or antibiotic combination likely to have been employed would have been highly active against streptococcus.""

Age UK Gloucestershire has reported a ""sizeable systemic fraud"" over a number of years, dating back to 2016. Chief Executive Matt Fellows said: ""With this money we would have been able to do so much more."" Gloucestershire Constabulary confirmed it had received a report from Age UK of suspected fraudulent activity. An employee has been interviewed under caution in relation to the allegations and the investigation is ongoing, the force added. Mr Fellows said the organisation discovered the fraud in July 2023, when a finance manager discovered a payment on their accounts that did not match the budget. They launched an internal investigation, which found further fraudulent payments. ""I'm incredibly sad and disappointed that this has occurred - for a variety of reasons,"" Mr Fellows said. ""With this money we would have been able to do so much more and achieve so much more. ""We're talking about 5-6% of our annual income so we would have been able to do 5-6% more.

Michael Rudkin's wife Susan was wrongly convicted of stealing money, while he lost his job and union position. The couple, who are featured in an ITV drama about the scandal, ran a branch in Leicestershire. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said new legislation will ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". The Post Office  prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from IT system Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Sunak announced on Wednesday victims would be able to sign a form to say they were innocent in order to have their convictions overturned and claim compensation. Mr Rudkin, who was played by Shaun Dooley in Mr Bates vs the Post Office, ran the Ibstock branch of the Post Office with his wife. Mrs Rudkin, who is too upset to speak publicly at the moment, was convicted of losing £44,000, given a suspended sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours community service while being electronically tagged. Her husband said: ""If you could even remotely think of what hell would look like, then multiply that by 10, that is how our lives have been the last 15 years, absolute hell. ""It doesn't get much worse than your wife contemplating suicide."" Reacting to the announcement of new legislation, Mr Rudkin said: ""I was pleased [by] the overall principle of making sure that everybody has this blanket overturning of convictions because they've waited far too long for this. ""On top of which, to be compensated, let's see what the detail is. ""It feels as though we're heading in the right direction. After 20 years, I hasten to add."" His wife's conviction was overturned in April 2021 but people's perception of them as a couple did not change dramatically, Mr Rudkin previously told the BBC. However, since the programme - which put the scandal in the spotlight - was broadcast people who he had not spoken to in 20 years have been getting in touch. Mr Rudkin added: ""From feeling castigated throughout your community and your friends... all of a sudden, I'm getting messages from people who I haven't spoken to for 20 years saying 'we saw the programme, we didn't realise. So sorry'."" He said he now wants recompense for their loss of earnings and compensation. The couple dismissed a previous compensation offer which Mr Rudkin called ""obscene"". A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both Post Office and government are committed to providing full, fair and final compensation for the people affected. ""To date, offers of compensation totalling more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 postmasters, the majority of which have been agreed and paid.""

Janine Powell, now 52, was wrongfully accused of stealing £74,000 from her branch in Tiverton, Devon. She was sacked and arrested, before being convicted at a trial in Exeter in 2008. She maintained her innocence but was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving five months. Ms Powell said the hardest part of her wrongful jailing had been leaving her children. ""You're stuck behind these four walls in a little room,"" she said. ""You get phone calls to find out what's happening outside with the children. ""I've missed out on doing things with them - I can't get that back."" The Post Office Horizon scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. What happened between 1999 and 2015 is now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. After Ms Powell was released from prison, she spent a further three months wearing a tag. She moved away from Tiverton, but said she could not escape feelings of guilt on her visits back to Devon. ""Even though people were being nice to you, saying 'I know you didn't do it', you know that as soon as you walk away, they're talking about it, saying that you've done it,"" she said. ""You feel guilty."" Some sub-postmasters, like Ms Powell, wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy - and some have since died. The Metropolitan Police is investigating possible fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the Horizon scandal - to which Ms Powell has given evidence - is continuing. The government is now facing increasing calls to bring forward emergency legislation to deal with the scandal and ministers said they would introduce plans to speed up the process ""shortly"". The former Justice Secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, said: ""Perhaps there should be a presumption that all those people who were convicted are in fact not guilty. ""We could go further and simply quash the convictions and render them absolutely void, so that then we're in a position whereby the sort of complications that are hitting the compensation process can be avoided."" Ms Powell's conviction was quashed, along with many others in 2022. She says, for her, details of compensation are not the issue. What she most wants is for the Post Office to ""hold their hands up"" and ""admit they were wrong"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Residents spoke to the BBC as the country continues to reel from what has been dubbed the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. It played its ""own little part in that history,"" said Kate Carless, the hall's current treasurer, with the village attracting visitors, some even stopping to take selfies outside the hall. ""I'm no longer the bookings secretary for the village hall, I'm more like its agent at the moment,"" Ms Carless adds. It is here where between 30 and 40 ex sub-postmasters and mistresses met for the first time one Sunday in 2009 - a gathering that led to the creation of the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) campaign group. The occasion was the first time many of them discovered they weren't alone in having fallen victim to the bugs in an accounting system called Horizon. The man who orchestrated that meeting was Alan Bates - now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - for fraudulent activity, based on information from Horizon. Many, including Mr Bates, maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues about errors in the accounting software. But some went to prison for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined, and some even took their own lives or died before getting a chance to clear their names. However, despite the avalanche of new publicity around the scandal, only 93 of them have had their convictions overturned. Now, a fresh police investigation into the Post Office and the way it pursued the cases has been launched, with 50 new potential victims coming forward. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells is also handing back her CBE with immediate effect, after a petition exceeded a million signatures. The TV drama and subsequent publicity has now really ""put the village in the spotlight,"" said Ms Carless. ""We've had people driving past the village hall quite slowly taking photos,"" she said. ""But it's a shame it has had to get to this for those people that have been affected. ""When you started watching the drama you were thinking how could this have happened to people."" In the drama Mr Bates, played by Toby Jones, can be seen seemingly choosing somewhere random for affected sub-postmasters to meet. ""Putting that pin into the map seems to have ignited both the residents and other people, who know that I live here, to get in touch,"" said village hall trustee Keith Hicks. He said he had heard of people taking selfies outside the hall, ""which seems quite amazing"". The hall wasn't used in the filming of the drama, he explained, ""but I can appreciate with the parking issues around here that it wouldn't be easy to bring a production team in"". He said he didn't remember the meeting in 2009, describing it as ""very low key"". ""It wasn't until I listened to the BBC Radio 4 podcast, The Great Post Office Trial, that I realised the significance that this little hall had played in the whole story,"" he said. ""These people were the life and soul of the community and then they were damned by the Post Office without any thought that they may be right. ""The fact that they came together here in the very first place, and realised that they weren't single entities, I think it's very significant."" Other local residents said they had also been amazed at the part their village played in the story. ""When you see him look at the map it's just amazing to think that they came here - it's a proud moment for the little people,"" said Alan Booth. Cindy Williams added there was the start of a local campaign to get Mr Bates back to the village for a visit. ""That would be so interesting, quite honestly,"" she said.

Ako Hussain Pur, 32, had been hired to carry out building work at the home in Sheffield, prosecutors said. On Friday, at Sheffield Crown Court, Pur, of no fixed address, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Pur was found guilty of sexual assault of a child under 13 following a four-day trial earlier this month. Jurors heard the attack happened in the girl's bedroom in June 2023. After the assault, Pur had told the girl not to tell anyone, the court heard. When confronted by the girl's father, he denied anything had happened, jurors were told. Sentencing, Judge Graham Reeds KC stated Pur had lied throughout the case, adding the victim should have been safe in her own home. After the hearing, Det Con Amy Blakey praised the ""tremendous courage"" of the victim. She added: ""It is thanks to her bravery and the incredible strength of her family that a dangerous man is now behind bars. ""Nothing can reverse the trauma and harm caused by this serious assault, but I hope that the result brings the victim and her family a certain level of closure."" In addition to the jail term, Pur was issued a lifelong sexual harm prevention order, placed on the sex offenders register and told he must serve an additional year on licence after his release.

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. Allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank, an inquest into his death heard. There is no evidence to suggest Mr Atkinson alerted staff to his allergy. The 23-year-old, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary an hour after ingesting peanuts. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen section of Dadyal's food safety management documents was blank. Mr Atkinson's flatmate, Luke Isley, previously gave evidence saying that the Newcastle University graduate had raised concerns about what he was eating as little as 30 seconds after beginning to eat his pizza, which sparked panic among his friends when he mentioned peanuts. By the time paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"", according to Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, who said he was ""profoundly unconscious"" by the time he was helped downstairs. He died in hospital less than an hour later. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts.

The proposed Exmouth station, to include a public inquiry desk, was given £5m funding in June 2023. But Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez, said a survey delay was ""driving her batty"". East Devon District Council confirmed bats had held up surveys and planning application processing. A spokesperson added: ""As the proposal involves demolishing the existing police station, further wildlife surveys are required to confirm if there are any legally protected species in the building that would be affected. ""On-site surveys cannot currently take place, as this may disturb hibernating bats, with surveys usually done from around April onwards. ""Until the impact of this demolition is understood, and suggestions to reduce any impacts are provided, the council is not allowed to grant planning permission."" It said the council had offered ""pre-application advice"" for a fee, so other elements such as design and impacts on highways and surrounding buildings, need not be impacted by the delay. Ms Hernandez previously said the station site would be redeveloped and a modern facility built for officers and staff. This week on social media she said: ""Bats stall my office's planning application for the new Exmouth Police Station. ""I have to wait until roosting season May-Sept to carry out a survey before East Devon District Council will even register the planning application. It's driving me batty! Can't blame the bats though."" The closure of the station to the public in 2015 was criticised but it has remained an operational base.

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now.""

""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said.

In January 2023, GNAAS began operating all week across the north-east of England and is looking to increase its service in Cumbria from the four nights a week it currently offers.Mr Stockton said: “We’re very proud of the fact that we have been operating a 24/7 service in the North East for over a year and we’re hoping to replicate this in Cumbria in the coming months."" The charity provides an air ambulance service across the region during daylight hours and from 8pm to 8am the team transfers to a rapid response car.Mr Stockton said: “Our rapid response vehicles were deployed nearly 300 times more last year in comparison to 2022. ""This is a direct result of our night-time expansion and just proves how vital it is for our team to be able to deliver a high level of pre-hospital care to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”GNAAS's critical care teams, based in Eaglescliffe in County Durham and Penrith in Cumbria, responded to incidents in the North East, North Yorkshire, Northumberland, Cumbria, Scotland and the Isle of Man.

More than 100 people queued outside the packed United Reform Church in Herne Bay on Tuesday to discuss Kent County Council's (KCC) Active Travel scheme. The scheme to close part of the Central Parade to traffic was intended to promote cycling and walking. Resident Simon Welsh said the plans had ""broken the town in two"". The scheme will see a section of Herne Bay's Central Parade closed and enforce a 20mph zone with one way routes in the surrounding area. However, residents have asked KCC to reconsider the £600,000 scheme. Local Sallyann Baxter launched a petition against the plans, which now has more than 1,000 signatures. Ms Baxter explained that she launched the petition after she had a near miss with a driver who ""was coming in the opposite direction to where the one way system was"". KCC's cabinet member for highways and transport, Neil Baker, said a previous consultation attracted fewer than 100 responses and that the speed which the changes had been put in place was possibly too fast. ""The implementation hasn't possibly helped with signs being in what some people are saying are confusing places. People are turning into roads and not seeing the no entry signs,"" he said. ""I think all of the strength of feeling we are seeing here tonight does have to be considered."" KCC said it was ""aware of concerns"" about the scheme and that its officers ""are listening"" to the community. KCC added it would reintroduce two-way traffic on Richmond Street, north of the High Street, from near the entrance of Texaco to maintain tanker access to the garage.

Haven, which runs 38 parks in the UK, said the first on-site pub would open at its Primrose Valley venue in Filey, North Yorkshire, in March. A spokesperson for the firm said no other locations had been currently been identified. Peter Blake, Haven's chief operating officer, said it was the first holiday provider to partner with the chain. He said: ""This new venture underlines our dedication to growing our food and beverage partnerships and offering for our holidaymakers and holiday homeowners."" Acquired by Blackstone in 2021, Haven said it had invested more than £170m in its parks over the past year, adding that the Wetherspoon deal was part of an additional £4m investment to improve its food and beverage offering. Michael Barron, commercial director at Wetherspoon, said: ""We are delighted to be partnering with Haven and are confident the pub will prove popular with holidaymakers."" The business is no stranger to looking beyond the high street to increase footfall. In 2022, it entered into into partnership with a students' union in the first deal of its kind at a British university. At the time, Hull University Students' Union said it meant ""students will have their very own 'Spoons' on campus"". And in 2014, Wetherspoon opened the first motorway service station pub, The Hope and Champion, off the M40 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, despite facing a backlash from road safety campaigners.

Minnie was born with Ebstein's Anomaly, which causes the right side of her heart not to function properly. The Chichester family were told Minnie would not make it to her teenage years. Father Jesse said the potential treatment was a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and ""everything to us"". Jesse and Minnie's mother, Charlotte, have launched a campaign to raise £140,000 to send Minnie to a specialist centre at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Some patients with Ebstein's Anomaly - a rare condition - can have a procedure to repair the faulty valve, known as cone surgery. However, Charlotte and Jesse were told by the NHS and a different clinic in the US that Minnie's condition was too severe to benefit from this treatment. ""As she grows, the heart isn't able to support her growth,"" said Charlotte. Charlotte said Minnie has low oxygen levels and receives extra nutrition through a tube. ""Because her heart works so hard she is constantly burning energy that she does not have so we have to feed her with triple calorie prescription feed."" The couple did their own research and approached the Da Silva Centre for Ebstein's Anomaly in Pittsburgh, where the surgery was developed. On 26 December, they were told by the centre that Minnie did have a chance of having the surgery. The parents said more tests were needed before the procedure, but if funds were raised and doctors were happy to proceed then the operation could take place later in 2024. University Hospital Southampton, which oversees Minnie's care, said it could not comment on individual cases but added: ""Acting in the best interest of our patients when determining their care is always our priority.""

Dunham Bridge, which carries the A57 over the River Trent, closed last week after the river overflowed in the aftermath of Storm Henk. Bridge director Stephen Betteridge said the crossing was used by about 10,000 vehicles a day. Its closure was having a ""significant"" impact, he added. Lincolnshire Police shared images on Saturday showing a car partially submerged at Dunham Bridge. Officers said the driver, who was not injured, ""thought they knew better"". Lincolnshire's fire chief Mark Baxter said: ""I recognise it's frustrating, but closures are there for a reason."" Mr Betteridge said it was ""ill-advised"" to ignore the warnings, especially as the flood water had reached up to 6ft (1.82m) in some areas around the bridge. However, he said he was hopeful it would recede enough in the next day or two to allow the bridge to reopen. Diversions are in place via the A1 and A46. An alternative route over the River Trent at Gainsborough was also closed due to flooding. According to traffic data analysts Inrix, the A631 Flood Road is closed in both directions between Beckingham and Gainsborough. One driver, who was attempting to travel from Doncaster to Gainsborough, told the BBC it had been a frustrating journey. ""I've been to Bawtry, and that's shut - I've been to the Gainsborough one and that's shut, so I've come here [Dunham Bridge] and that's shut. ""So now I'm going to go to Newark and try that,"" he added. Others said they had been unaware of the closures, but had opted to turn back due to the length of the diversions.

Most of the building in Whitchurch, which also houses the town's library, was shut in September when the unsafe concrete was discovered. Shropshire councillors will be presented with six options for the building when they meet next Wednesday. But the MP for North Shropshire, Helen Morgan, has insisted a replacement for the centre is essential. The report for the authority's cabinet said the cost of repairing the building would be ""significant"" and ""would be uneconomic and not viable for the council"". The six options it sets out include doing nothing, carrying out repairs which could cost up to £2.5m and demolishing the building and making the land available for redevelopment. Another option would be demolishing the site and building a replacement civic centre, but the report said this could cost the authority up to £7.6m. The report said the redevelopment of the site would include an ""opportunity to deliver community services within the heart of the town centre as part of a mixed use scheme"". But Mrs Morgan said: ""Losing the Civic Centre would rip the heart out of Whitchurch unless a replacement is funded."" She said Shropshire Council had a duty to support the ""economic and social development of our market towns"" and added: ""Residents in Whitchurch are rightly outraged at these proposals."" Dean Carroll, the cabinet member responsible housing and assets, said library services would continue in the town and promised to ""work closely with Whitchurch Town Council to help them identify a new civic venue"". The issue of Raac - reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete - came to prominence last year when structural issues appeared in schools and other public buildings. It is a lightweight material that was used mostly in flat roofing, but also in floors and walls, between the 1950s and 1990s. It is a cheaper alternative to standard concrete, is quicker to produce and easier to install. But it is less durable and has a lifespan of around 30 years.

Somerset Council declared a ""financial emergency"" in November 2023 and has been working to reduce a projected overspend of £18m next year. Significant amounts of its existing land, property assets and commercial investments could be sold off. Councillors have now said this could include the Saxonvale site in Frome town centre to help save £20m. The council has around 1,300 individual land and property assets, along with a large number of much smaller parcels of utility land. A large amount of these assets cannot easily be sold off since they deliver statutory services - such as schools and libraries - or are protected by legal conditions which make their sale unviable. The council's chief financial officer, Jason Vaughan, revealed in December 2023 that 16 sites had been sold in the financial year to date, and a further 74 sites had been identified as surplus and were in the process of being sold off. Oliver Woodhams, the council's service director for strategic asset management, told the authority's corporate and resources scrutiny committee in Taunton on January 4 that asset sales in the current financial year had generated £4.7m of income for the council, with a further £2.9m expected by the end of the financial year. An additional £8.5m of assets could be sold off by April 2025 - taking a total of £16.5m off the council's projected budget gap, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). ""With our larger brownfield sites, we will be preparing parcels of those to be sold for regeneration efforts, such as Firepool and Saxonvale,"" he added. Councillor Shane Collins, who represents the Frome East division, claimed that the council was already in the process of selling the Saxonvale site to Mayday Saxonvale after the rivalling Acorn bid to develop the site was quashed by the High Court in October 2023. ""For councillors in Frome, we would really like an update on what's happening. It's been sitting there for 20 years,"" he said.

Developer Peel Waters has agreed for property company ICITIES to build the multi-purpose rink by Chill Factore at the Trafford Centre. It is set to be run by chain Planet Ice, which operates 14 other venues across the UK. James Whittaker of Peel Waters said the ""brilliant attraction"" could also become a venue for Olympic hopefuls. He told BBC Radio Manchester the arena would have several thousand seats for crowds to watch sports such as ice hockey, and will also feature a speed skating track. The project had ""exciting potential"" to host professional teams and build on the popularity of ice hockey clubs like Manchester Storm, Mr Whittaker said. He said he hoped to see a planning application submitted by the summer, with the project expected to take 12 to 15 months to build at the former Soccer Dome site that was cleared by Peel Waters last year. It comes after the firm, part of North West property giant the Peel Group, reached terms with the developer for the new arena to be constructed and leased to Planet Ice. The ice rink chain's chief officer Heath Rhodes said the site was easily accessible from the M60, meaning customers from ""Liverpool, Warrington and Manchester are all within close range"". But the project will not solely cater for ice skating and other winter sports, with the arena designed to be a ""multi-use space"" that includes ""on and off ice entertainment"" as well as food and drink outlets. ICITIES director Nick Payne said the ""showcase"" arena would address a ""general lack of first-rate facilities for many event space operators like virtual reality, Esports, racket sports as well as screening and live entertainment"". Meanwhile Mr Rhodes said the project would help take pressure off Planet Ice's Oakfield Road facility nearby in Altrincham, which was ""often at capacity"". The latest deal from Peel Waters, which oversaw major North West infrastructure project like Salford's MediaCityUK and Wirral Waters, comes after it announced a £1bn scheme to create new district, water park and surf lagoon in Trafford.

Jessica Daley drove from Middlesbrough to Leicester to star as Eva Perón in Evita on Saturday after the original actor and understudy both fell ill. With less than three hours practice, Ms Daley took to the stage to fill the role at the city's Curve theatre. Original lyricist Sir Tim Rice said he heard her performance was ""amazing"". Nikolai Foster, artistic director at the Curve, said the theatre had a ""chaotic"" start to Saturday, when their leading lady and understudy fell ill. ""It's a pretty remarkable thing that Jess and indeed the whole team pulled off on Saturday,"" he said. ""It's a testament to the expertise that we've got here in the building, that they can adapt and work so quickly and methodically and safely to enable an actor to literally turn up at 16:00 and by 19:00, be delivering the performance that Jess did."" Mr Foster said Ms Daley ""blew the absolute roof off the place"". ""It's obviously a testament to Jess' talent and stupendous ability as an actor that she could go on stage and deliver,"" he said. ""This wasn't just Jess getting through the performance. This was Jess absolutely inhabiting the role, making it her own and really delivering something that will stay in our memories forever."" Sir Tim and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the musical about the life of Argentine political leader Eva Perón in 1978. It was turned into a film in 1996 with Madonna in the title role. Sir Tim, who watched the show on Tuesday, said he had been told by former cricketer and Test Match Special commentator Jonathan Agnew that Ms Daley's performance was ""amazing"". ""I've come to see Evita, which I heard was very good, and has had some dramatic, unexpected attention,"" he said. ""It's got a very good cast, and I'm looking forward to seeing it. ""I've heard that the regular performers are really good, and I was going to come anyway, and I'm still absolutely delighted to be here."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Oxfordshire County Council said the work at Kidlington Roundabout was due to run until June 2024. The council warned that ""delays are likely throughout the works"". The roundabout is on one of the main routes into Oxford and is near where Oxford United has proposed building its new stadium. The scheme is expected to include new dedicated bus lanes on Bicester Road southbound. This would link with the bus lane on the eastern section of Kidlington Roundabout, as well as new signalised crossings on Bicester Road, Oxford Road and Frieze Way. There is also a reduction in speed limits from 40mph (64km/h) to 30mph (48km/h) being proposed, a new 11ft (3.5m) wide shared use pedestrian and cycle path, as well as ""improved street and footpath lighting"". A drop-in event will be held on 25 January from 14:00 to 18:00 GMT at Exeter Hall in Kidlington, which the council said was ""an information event on the project and how we aim to minimise disruption"". A spokesman for the county council said: ""While disruption will be minimised wherever possible, delays are likely throughout the works and everyone is being asked to review their daily route, mode of transport and time of travel and, where possible, consider alternatives.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51zxx659yzo,Flooded resident says water levels remain high,,2024-01-10,"A man whose home flooded after a nearby river burst its banks last week has said there is still no sign of water levels dropping despite days of dry weather. Sami Gabriel, who lives by the River Lambourn in the Shaw area of Newbury, Berkshire, saw water gushing into his property after torrential rain hit the area. Mr Gabriel said water had ""managed to come up through the ground"" in one part of his house despite having ""really good flood defences"" in place. A number of flood warnings remain active across the county, including three in Newbury. Mr Gabriel told BBC Radio Berkshire that to begin with, he and his wife were taking it in turns to sleep so they could monitor river levels. Last night they ""did get a bit of sleep"" as the floors were ""almost dry"".""This morning, we're back to a couple of centimetres,"" he said.He said his daughter was currently sitting her mock A Levels, and he and his wife had ""tried our best to isolate the kids from what's going on"".But he added everyone had to help with things like moving furniture, so they were ""bluntly aware"" of the situation. The recent flooding in Berkshire is ""right up there with some of the most significant flooding that we've seen"", according to Tim Readings from Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service . He said it had had a ""devastating impact"" on communities.A number of homes in Wraysbury were evacuated on Monday night, something Mr Readings said was ""not just a case of transporting people from A to B"".""People lose all sorts of items that are irreplaceable with great sentimental value,"" he said.""It's a really delicate operation.""But Mr Gabriel said despite the ""distressing"" floods, there had been an ""outpouring of support"", with neighbours helping each other and sharing food and other resources.""We pull together as a family,"" he said.""And quite frankly, we pull together as a community as well.""

The plans - which are adjustments to the original proposals for the project - also include new cycle lanes and more parking bays for blue badge holders. However, campaigners have raised concerns that the changes will cause gridlocked traffic in the city. The decision to move forward with the project, which spans from the Old Steine to the seafront, comes after meetings between Brighton and Hove City Council councillors and officers.As a result, the changes were made, including creating more space for buses to move in and out of stops, an additional taxi rank, improved lighting and a new obstruction-free pavement design.Councillors have now asked officers to proceed with the procurement of a principal contractor. Trevor Muten, chair of the transport and sustainability committee, said the review gave residents, businesses and visitors the “best possible scheme, which delivered on its objectives and worked for everyone”.However, Valley Gardens Forum, a group of residents and businesses, said the plans will create more traffic in Brighton and Hove.

Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear.""

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law.

Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death. The Bibby Stockholm, which became fully operational in October, has been chartered by the government to hold about 500 people while their asylum claims are processed. The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good. ''He said he was treated very badly there. One egg in the morning. 'They treat us like animals', he said,"" she told the agency. Mr Farruku's cousin, Marenglen Farruku, also told Reuters: ""He went there for a better life. ""He never showed any sign of distress. There are so many unanswered questions what has happened there."" An imam chanted prayers and family members cried out as Mr Farruku's coffin was lowered into a grave, Reuters reported. Mr Farruku's roommate, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, has told BBC News other barge residents might harm themselves if conditions on board did not improve. He said there had been complaints about poor quality food, cold showers, unreliable wi-fi and concerns not being dealt with. He said: ""They're saying Leonard's death is just the beginning. ""They are trying to give a warning. That place is not good for them. Every day their stress is increasing, getting worse."" In a statement, the Home Office said it took the welfare of barge residents ""very seriously"" and had ""rigorous safeguarding processes in place"". ""Any concerns raised about the service delivered on the barge are swiftly addressed through our work with the provider, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year,"" it added.

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying.

""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying.

Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death. The Bibby Stockholm, which became fully operational in October, has been chartered by the government to hold about 500 people while their asylum claims are processed. The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good. ''He said he was treated very badly there. One egg in the morning. 'They treat us like animals', he said,"" she told the agency. Mr Farruku's cousin, Marenglen Farruku, also told Reuters: ""He went there for a better life. ""He never showed any sign of distress. There are so many unanswered questions what has happened there."" An imam chanted prayers and family members cried out as Mr Farruku's coffin was lowered into a grave, Reuters reported. Mr Farruku's roommate, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, has told BBC News other barge residents might harm themselves if conditions on board did not improve. He said there had been complaints about poor quality food, cold showers, unreliable wi-fi and concerns not being dealt with. He said: ""They're saying Leonard's death is just the beginning. ""They are trying to give a warning. That place is not good for them. Every day their stress is increasing, getting worse."" In a statement, the Home Office said it took the welfare of barge residents ""very seriously"" and had ""rigorous safeguarding processes in place"". ""Any concerns raised about the service delivered on the barge are swiftly addressed through our work with the provider, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year,"" it added.

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

Fifteen-month-old Olly Stopforth, from Frodsham, died two days after being discharged from the Countess of Chester Hospital in March 2020. He had a streptococcal infection, which led to sepsis and a viral infection. A jury inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court found medics could have saved him if tests had been carried out. In a statement read out by the coroner the hospital trust said it had improved since Olly's death and was now using the national guidelines on sepsis testing. A solicitor for Olly's parents, Laura and Karl Stopforth, said it had been ""incredibly painful and difficult"" for them to hear from hospital professionals that more should have been done to properly diagnose and treat their son. They felt their son was ""not considered as a priority when he was in hospital"" and they had been ""very upset to hear that the medical staff trusted with their little boy's care did not provide him with adequate medical attention"". ""No parent should lose their young child as they have, it is especially painful because they lost their beautiful boy in preventable circumstances,"" the solicitor added, saying the family would be pursuing a medical negligence claim against the trust. The inquest jury accepted the Covid-19 pandemic had made things harder for staff during the time when Olly was being treated. It heard that hospital staff were under pressure because the pandemic had just started and they were unsure about how it would affect children or how long patients should be kept in hospital. But the jury found the baby was not adequately cared for at the hospital, as doctors thought he only had a viral infection and did not carry out tests that could have shown he was suffering from the more serious bacterial infection. Olly was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital after becoming ill at home and a video consultation with a GP who suspected he had a viral infection. One of the paramedics who took him to hospital thought Olly had ""grossly abnormal"" signs and was ""very poorly"", as he had a rash, a high temperature and a high heart rate. Olly remained at the Accident and Emergency Department for nearly six hours before being transferred to a ward, and was discharged four hours later. His mum Laura found him dead in bed two days later. A consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester, Dr Alison Timmis, told the inquest no steps had been taken to rule out a bacterial infection. She agreed that if Olly had been given antibiotics it was ""very likely"" he would have survived. An expert witness told the inquest she did not understand why a sepsis screening tool had not been used at the hospital. Another expert, microbiologist Prof Vav Cartwright, said in a statement: ""Almost any intravenous antibiotic or antibiotic combination likely to have been employed would have been highly active against streptococcus."" ""On the balance of probabilities Olly would have required a two-week course of antibiotics, after which he would have made a full recovery,"" she added. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said it was her sincere hope the trust had learnt serious lessons. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

The proposed Exmouth station, to include a public inquiry desk, was given £5m funding in June 2023. But Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez, said a survey delay was ""driving her batty"". East Devon District Council confirmed bats had held up surveys and planning application processing. A spokesperson added: ""As the proposal involves demolishing the existing police station, further wildlife surveys are required to confirm if there are any legally protected species in the building that would be affected. ""On-site surveys cannot currently take place, as this may disturb hibernating bats, with surveys usually done from around April onwards. ""Until the impact of this demolition is understood, and suggestions to reduce any impacts are provided, the council is not allowed to grant planning permission."" It said the council had offered ""pre-application advice"" for a fee, so other elements such as design and impacts on highways and surrounding buildings, need not be impacted by the delay. Ms Hernandez previously said the station site would be redeveloped and a modern facility built for officers and staff. This week on social media she said: ""Bats stall my office's planning application for the new Exmouth Police Station. ""I have to wait until roosting season May-Sept to carry out a survey before East Devon District Council will even register the planning application. It's driving me batty! Can't blame the bats though."" The closure of the station to the public in 2015 was criticised but it has remained an operational base. The new station is due to be be financed by the sale of part of the existing site in North Street. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Janine Powell, now 52, was wrongfully accused of stealing £74,000 from her branch in Tiverton, Devon. She was sacked and arrested, before being convicted at a trial in Exeter in 2008. She maintained her innocence but was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving five months. Ms Powell said the hardest part of her wrongful jailing had been leaving her children. ""You're stuck behind these four walls in a little room,"" she said. ""You get phone calls to find out what's happening outside with the children. ""I've missed out on doing things with them - I can't get that back."" The Post Office Horizon scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. What happened between 1999 and 2015 is now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. After Ms Powell was released from prison, she spent a further three months wearing a tag. She moved away from Tiverton, but said she could not escape feelings of guilt on her visits back to Devon. ""Even though people were being nice to you, saying 'I know you didn't do it', you know that as soon as you walk away, they're talking about it, saying that you've done it,"" she said. ""You feel guilty."" Some sub-postmasters, like Ms Powell, wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy - and some have since died. The Metropolitan Police is investigating possible fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the Horizon scandal - to which Ms Powell has given evidence - is continuing. The government is now facing increasing calls to bring forward emergency legislation to deal with the scandal and ministers said they would introduce plans to speed up the process ""shortly"". The former Justice Secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, said: ""Perhaps there should be a presumption that all those people who were convicted are in fact not guilty. ""We could go further and simply quash the convictions and render them absolutely void, so that then we're in a position whereby the sort of complications that are hitting the compensation process can be avoided."" Ms Powell's conviction was quashed, along with many others in 2022. She says, for her, details of compensation are not the issue. What she most wants is for the Post Office to ""hold their hands up"" and ""admit they were wrong"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

On Friday, at Sheffield Crown Court, Pur, of no fixed address, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Pur was found guilty of sexual assault of a child under 13 following a four-day trial earlier this month. Jurors heard the attack happened in the girl's bedroom in June 2023. After the assault, Pur had told the girl not to tell anyone, the court heard. When confronted by the girl's father, he denied anything had happened, jurors were told. Sentencing, Judge Graham Reeds KC stated Pur had lied throughout the case, adding the victim should have been safe in her own home. After the hearing, Det Con Amy Blakey praised the ""tremendous courage"" of the victim. She added: ""It is thanks to her bravery and the incredible strength of her family that a dangerous man is now behind bars. ""Nothing can reverse the trauma and harm caused by this serious assault, but I hope that the result brings the victim and her family a certain level of closure.""

Michael Rudkin's wife Susan was wrongly convicted of stealing money, while he lost his job and union position. The couple, who are featured in an ITV drama about the scandal, ran a branch in Leicestershire. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said new legislation will ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". The Post Office  prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from IT system Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Sunak announced on Wednesday victims would be able to sign a form to say they were innocent in order to have their convictions overturned and claim compensation. Mr Rudkin, who was played by Shaun Dooley in Mr Bates vs the Post Office, ran the Ibstock branch of the Post Office with his wife. Mrs Rudkin, who is too upset to speak publicly at the moment, was convicted of losing £44,000, given a suspended sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours community service while being electronically tagged. Her husband said: ""If you could even remotely think of what hell would look like, then multiply that by 10, that is how our lives have been the last 15 years, absolute hell. ""It doesn't get much worse than your wife contemplating suicide."" Reacting to the announcement of new legislation, Mr Rudkin said: ""I was pleased [by] the overall principle of making sure that everybody has this blanket overturning of convictions because they've waited far too long for this. ""On top of which, to be compensated, let's see what the detail is. ""It feels as though we're heading in the right direction. After 20 years, I hasten to add."" His wife's conviction was overturned in April 2021 but people's perception of them as a couple did not change dramatically, Mr Rudkin previously told the BBC. However, since the programme - which put the scandal in the spotlight - was broadcast people who he had not spoken to in 20 years have been getting in touch. Mr Rudkin added: ""From feeling castigated throughout your community and your friends... all of a sudden, I'm getting messages from people who I haven't spoken to for 20 years saying 'we saw the programme, we didn't realise. So sorry'."" He said he now wants recompense for their loss of earnings and compensation. The couple dismissed a previous compensation offer which Mr Rudkin called ""obscene"". A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both Post Office and government are committed to providing full, fair and final compensation for the people affected. ""To date, offers of compensation totalling more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 postmasters, the majority of which have been agreed and paid.""

Residents spoke to the BBC as the country continues to reel from what has been dubbed the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. It played its ""own little part in that history,"" said Kate Carless, the hall's current treasurer, with the village attracting visitors, some even stopping to take selfies outside the hall. ""I'm no longer the bookings secretary for the village hall, I'm more like its agent at the moment,"" Ms Carless adds. It is here where between 30 and 40 ex sub-postmasters and mistresses met for the first time one Sunday in 2009 - a gathering that led to the creation of the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) campaign group. The occasion was the first time many of them discovered they weren't alone in having fallen victim to the bugs in an accounting system called Horizon. The man who orchestrated that meeting was Alan Bates - now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - for fraudulent activity, based on information from Horizon. Many, including Mr Bates, maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues about errors in the accounting software. But some went to prison for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined, and some even took their own lives or died before getting a chance to clear their names. However, despite the avalanche of new publicity around the scandal, only 93 of them have had their convictions overturned. Now, a fresh police investigation into the Post Office and the way it pursued the cases has been launched, with 50 new potential victims coming forward. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells is also handing back her CBE with immediate effect, after a petition exceeded a million signatures. The TV drama and subsequent publicity has now really ""put the village in the spotlight,"" said Ms Carless. ""We've had people driving past the village hall quite slowly taking photos,"" she said. ""But it's a shame it has had to get to this for those people that have been affected. ""When you started watching the drama you were thinking how could this have happened to people."" In the drama Mr Bates, played by Toby Jones, can be seen seemingly choosing somewhere random for affected sub-postmasters to meet. ""Putting that pin into the map seems to have ignited both the residents and other people, who know that I live here, to get in touch,"" said village hall trustee Keith Hicks. He said he had heard of people taking selfies outside the hall, ""which seems quite amazing"". The hall wasn't used in the filming of the drama, he explained, ""but I can appreciate with the parking issues around here that it wouldn't be easy to bring a production team in"". He said he didn't remember the meeting in 2009, describing it as ""very low key"". ""It wasn't until I listened to the BBC Radio 4 podcast, The Great Post Office Trial, that I realised the significance that this little hall had played in the whole story,"" he said. ""These people were the life and soul of the community and then they were damned by the Post Office without any thought that they may be right. ""The fact that they came together here in the very first place, and realised that they weren't single entities, I think it's very significant."" Other local residents said they had also been amazed at the part their village played in the story. ""When you see him look at the map it's just amazing to think that they came here - it's a proud moment for the little people,"" said Alan Booth. Cindy Williams added there was the start of a local campaign to get Mr Bates back to the village for a visit. ""That would be so interesting, quite honestly,"" she said.

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now."" She said there were many people who ""thoroughly and richly deserve these awards"" but the system was ""devalued"" by others. ""The fact is the honours is broken and needs a complete overhaul by No 10 and onwards to the monarch who rubber stamps what happens,"" she said. ""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said.

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. Allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank, an inquest into his death heard. There is no evidence to suggest Mr Atkinson alerted staff to his allergy. The 23-year-old, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary an hour after ingesting peanuts. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen section of Dadyal's food safety management documents was blank. Mr Atkinson's flatmate, Luke Isley, previously gave evidence saying that the Newcastle University graduate had raised concerns about what he was eating as little as 30 seconds after beginning to eat his pizza, which sparked panic among his friends when he mentioned peanuts. By the time paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"", according to Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, who said he was ""profoundly unconscious"" by the time he was helped downstairs. He died in hospital less than an hour later. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts.

Janine Powell, now 52, was wrongfully accused of stealing £74,000 from her branch in Tiverton, Devon. She was sacked and arrested, before being convicted at a trial in Exeter in 2008. She maintained her innocence but was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving five months. Ms Powell said the hardest part of her wrongful jailing had been leaving her children. ""You're stuck behind these four walls in a little room,"" she said. ""You get phone calls to find out what's happening outside with the children. ""I've missed out on doing things with them - I can't get that back."" The Post Office Horizon scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. What happened between 1999 and 2015 is now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. After Ms Powell was released from prison, she spent a further three months wearing a tag. She moved away from Tiverton, but said she could not escape feelings of guilt on her visits back to Devon. ""Even though people were being nice to you, saying 'I know you didn't do it', you know that as soon as you walk away, they're talking about it, saying that you've done it,"" she said. ""You feel guilty."" Some sub-postmasters, like Ms Powell, wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy - and some have since died. The Metropolitan Police is investigating possible fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the Horizon scandal - to which Ms Powell has given evidence - is continuing. The government is now facing increasing calls to bring forward emergency legislation to deal with the scandal and ministers said they would introduce plans to speed up the process ""shortly"". The former Justice Secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, said: ""Perhaps there should be a presumption that all those people who were convicted are in fact not guilty. ""We could go further and simply quash the convictions and render them absolutely void, so that then we're in a position whereby the sort of complications that are hitting the compensation process can be avoided."" Ms Powell's conviction was quashed, along with many others in 2022. She says, for her, details of compensation are not the issue. What she most wants is for the Post Office to ""hold their hands up"" and ""admit they were wrong"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

PJA was hired by a partnership of Shropshire Council, Shrewsbury Town Council and Shrewsbury Business Improvement District. It has set out a number of recommendations to reduce the number of vehicles passing through the town centre and ""make Shrewsbury more successful and a better place to live"". They include a new parkway rail station to the east of the town, a water taxi, and greater priority for buses. Conservative Ian Nellins, Shropshire Council's representative on the Shrewsbury Big Town Partnership, said: ""A lot of traffic that comes through the town that doesn't serve any purpose to the business of Shrewsbury."" His party has put forward the idea of the relief road to take some of that traffic around the town instead and the authority has approved the plans. Mr Nellins said: ""We've always done this with or without the North West Relief Road."" But he also said ""it would work a lot better"" if the long-awaited scheme goes ahead. Labour councillor Alan Moseley said the relief road, which his party has opposed, remained a ""bone of contention"". He represents Shrewsbury Town Council in the partnership and said the majority of its members also oppose the road, but if it does not go ahead ""then the changes can still happen"". Mr Moseley emphasised the traffic changes would be a ""10-year programme of works and change"" and nothing would happen overnight"". He added: ""Nothing is this report is in tablets of stone except for desire to see change in transportation."" Consultation is due to start on 26 January and end on 22 March.

Katie Tyler, from Reydon, Suffolk, who has two sons, said she would struggle to return to work after maternity leave because of the lack of local childcare. The Brambles Day Community Nursery was one of 22 shut on 29 December. The government said it was rolling out the ""single biggest investment in childcare in England ever"". Brambles was one of 22 providers that was""regretfully"" closed by Ipswich-based Alpha Nurseries amid financial problems. It ran nurseries in eight counties. In a letter, the company said: ""Essentially there was no ability for the business to continue to remain open."" Ms Tyler, who is 27 and has sons aged four and six months, said a lack of places at local childcare centres meant she faced having to find a new job 12 miles (19km) away from home, in Lowestoft, in order to obtain easier access to childcare. She said: ""All of my family is in Ipswich and me and my partner only moved here [Reydon, near Southwold] in September so we've got no real friends that I could leave my children with. ""My only option is finding a certified childcare provider but there's only one other nursery and one childminder in Reydon and Southwold which, as far as I'm aware, haven't got any space at the moment."" Ms Tyler, who has called for ""more childcare provision"", added: ""I want to work, but I can't and that is the bottom line. And I can't afford not to work so I'm stuck. It's a catch-22 situation."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""To make sure there are enough places across the country, we are investing hundreds of millions of pounds to increase hourly funding rates, and have allocated £100m in capital funding for more early years and wrapround places and spaces.

Nick Paxman, the diocesan property manager, said: ""The old Victorian vicarage in the village, though charming to look at, was very expensive for us to maintain, and more importantly impossibly expensive for our vicar to heat.""Now that the work has completed, Rev Canon Angela Whittaker and her husband Andrew will move into the new property in the coming days. To reduce the building's carbon footprint a new heat pump was installed, along with a pressurised water heating system, solar panels and battery storage facilities.Anna Newlove, diocesan pastoral and net zero officer, said: “I’ve worked closely with our property team to ensure that the additional electricity costs of the heat pump are offset by the solar panel installations to attain net carbon zero status."" The Diocese has budgeted £1.25m over the next five years towards upgrading its properties, with the Natland vicarage one of three currently in the works.Work has begun on a vicarage in Grasmere, while upgrades are scheduled for Easter on a property in Wigton. Bishop Saner-Haigh said the Church faced challenges in meeting its net carbon zero target but that it was working to ""tread gently"" to protect the environment.He said: ""The improvement to this eco vicarage and our future schedule of works reflects this ongoing commitment.""

Surinder Kaur, 81, died after she was hit by a vehicle on Oldbury Road in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, on 13 November 2022. Arjun Dosanjh, 26, and Jacek Wiatrowski, 51, did not know each other but decided to race after pulling up at traffic lights next to each other, police said. Both vehicles were significantly exceeding the speed limit, they added. CCTV footage showed Wiatrowski, who was driving a black BMW, braking heavily as he spotted Mrs Kaur crossing the road. He narrowly missed her but detectives said he caused Dosanjh, who was driving a blue Mini, to swerve on to the wrong side of the road, avoiding the BMW but hitting Mrs Kaur. Both defendants pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing. At Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday, Wiatrowski, of Pine Avenue, Wednesbury, and Dosanjih, of MacDonald Close, Oldbury, were each jailed for six years and banned from driving for eight years. In a victim statement read out to the court and released by police, Mrs Kaur's family said: ""Our mum lived a very simple life. She was a deeply religious woman and on the day of the accident she was on her way home from the Gurdwara. ""The days and weeks after mum's death were really tough: as well as trying to come to terms with our loss we had to deal with an ongoing police investigation. ""My first thought every morning is of mum, my last thought every night is of mum. These thoughts are not happy memories, but the thought of the pain she must have experienced in those final moments of her life. These thoughts haunt all of her family.""

Of the planned remaining houses, half would be affordable and the development would include public open space, play areas and room for St Peter’s Primary School to expand. But concerns have been raised, including about the proposed blocks of single-bedroom flats, which Herefordshire Council’s housing team claimed could attract anti-social behaviour.The authority’s highways officer Katy Jones also raised fears over access from the proposed estate to Queen Elizabeth High School across the A44.She described the application as “only just about acceptable”. Despite the concerns, the council’s planning office recommended the scheme for approval. Their report said the development would “give rise to both social and economic benefits”. A decision on the planning application will be made by Herefordshire Council’s planning committee on 17 January.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-67933366,Mr Bates vs The Post Office director delighted by audience reaction,"The reaction to an ITV drama about the Post Office scandal has been ""beyond our wildest dreams"", its director says.",2024-01-10,"The reaction to an ITV drama about the Post Office scandal has been ""beyond our wildest dreams"", its director says. Mr. Bates vs The Post Office tells the story of hundreds of postmasters who were wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting. It happened because the IT system they were using, Horizon, was defective. James Strong, who directed the series, says the audience figures have been ""astonishing"" . Former Post Office CEO Paula Vennells has handed back her CBE following the reaction to the programme. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty IT system. More than 700 branch managers were given criminal convictions - only 93 of which have been overturned Justice Secretary and Cheltenham MP Alex Chalk said in the House of Commons on Tuesday that a law to quash hundreds of convictions was being ""actively considered"". Two former post office managers in Gloucestershire who were among the 736 accused of wrongdoing said they are still fighting for further justice. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to address the scandal in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions at 12:00 GMT. Speaking on BBC Radio Bristol Mr Strong said the impact of the series is ""astonishing"". Mr Strong, who is from Bristol, said: ""It is beyond all of our wildest dreams that this has had such an impact. ""To see it grasp the whole nation and see it front page in the newspapers every single day since. ""To see the figures where we have seen - nine, 10 million come in and watch the first episode - it really is astonishing."" He added: ""We did not have any sales anywhere abroad, the money [for the series] was really tight. The actors, everybody, took a pay cut to do it. ""It is really important that this drama shows these kinds of stories, it is really important that we dramatise them. ""The power is there, so we have to do more."" Darren Jones, Bristol North West MP and former chair of the business committee, told BBC Radio Bristol that the coronavirus pandemic stopped a committee hearing with the Post Office and Fujitsu taking place. By the time restrictions were lifted, a statutory inquiry was about to start and the two could not happen simultaneously. Mr Jones added that a ""whole host of lessons that need to be learned"". He said: ""One of the key ones is why is it that from the IT engineers through to employees at the Post Office, to senior directors, to the board, to the non-executive directors, to the government officials, to the court process, was it not clear that these victims were innocent? ""Why could they not defend themselves? One of the key reasons is that the law on computers is out of date. ""It assumes that computers are right unless the defendant or in this case the victim can prove otherwise. ""Because of the lack of those checks and balances, and the lack of access to information, those sub postmasters were never going to be able to defend themselves within the law. ""That should be reviewed but equally the governance and accountability around organisations, whether they are privately or publicly owned, needs to be considered so that these types of miscarriages of justice can never happen again."" Meanwhile, Gloucester MP Richard Graham said he is going to investigate whether the closure of a post office in Kingsholm is related to the scandal. He told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: ""I do not know for sure but I am going to be asking the questions whether that decision was based on some false accounting and a belief that the post office was losing money when in fact it almost certainly was not. ""There were 500 pensioners who were getting their money from Kingsholm post office who were severely disadvantaged by that decision. ""I think there will be more cases like that of post offices closing. I am afraid this story is going to go on for a long time."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63642856,Black mould: How dangerous is it in the home and how can it be treated?,"Exposure to mould can cause respiratory illnesses, allergies and asthma, and can sometimes be fatal.",2024-01-10,"Exposure to mould can cause respiratory illnesses, allergies and asthma, and can sometimes be fatal. In 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died after prolonged exposure to mould in his home in Rochdale. Under new government proposals, dubbed ""Awaab's law"", social housing landlords in England could be forced to repair mouldy properties much more quickly. Mould - sometimes referred to using the American spelling mold - is a microscopic fungus that grows in damp places. Mould spores are found everywhere, and are released in their thousands into the atmosphere. Signs of mould at home include fuzzy black, white or green patches on the walls, and a damp and musty smell. People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma. Inhaling or touching the spores that mould releases into the air can cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and a skin rash. Mould can also trigger asthma attacks and cause coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. Each year, the NHS in England spends an estimated £1.4bn on treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing, according to building research body BRE. Those more at risk from mould include the elderly, children and babies, as well as people with existing respiratory illnesses and some skin problems. Condensation is the leading cause of mould in homes across the UK. It most commonly occurs in parts of the home where there are high moisture levels: bathrooms, kitchens, and around windows. When air cools, water vapour forms into water droplets as it comes into contact with surfaces in the home that are below a temperature known as the dew point. These surfaces can include uninsulated external walls or windows. If left untreated, the surface can become damp and create the conditions for mould to grow. Older and poorly insulated properties are more prone to this. Mould can also be caused by daily tasks which create excess moisture such as showering, cooking and drying washing indoors. Taking shorter showers and wiping down surfaces afterwards can help, as can improving ventilation, and opening kitchen windows or using an extractor fan when cooking. It is also important to check for leaky pipes or gutters which can make the problem worse. Private and social landlords have a responsibility to make sure homes are safe and in good repair. In private and social rental properties, it is the landlord's responsibility to fix a mould problem which is due to poor maintenance, according to the housing charity Shelter. If the mould is so bad that your home becomes unfit for habitation, then you could be classed as homeless and entitled to emergency accommodation. But landlords may not be responsible if there is evidence a tenant has not been ventilating the home correctly. In December 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died after prolonged exposure to mould in his home. He lived in a one-bedroom flat in Rochdale with his father Faisal Abdullah and Faisal's wife Aisha Amin. Mr Abdullah reported mould developing in the flat to his housing association, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), in 2017, but was told to paint over it. In June 2020, he instructed solicitors to issue a claim over the recurring mould, but any repairs could not be done until the case was settled. Awaab was taken to Rochdale Urgent Care Centre on 19 December that year with shortness of breath, and died a few days later after suffering respiratory and cardiac arrest. The government has announced plans to ensure social housing providers in England address hazards such as damp and mould more quickly. Social landlords would have to investigate issues within 14 days and begin fixing them within a further seven days. Emergency repairs would have to be made within 24 hours. Landlords who fail to comply could be taken to court and ordered to pay compensation. A consultation on the proposals closes on 5 March. After this, the government says it will bring Awaab's Law into force ""as soon as practically possible"". In Wales, the director of Housing and Regeneration asked social landlords to set out their response to the issues highlighted by Awaab's death. Four leading housing organisations in Scotland issued updated guidance about how the social housing sector should respond to damp and mould. In December 2022, the body representing Northern Ireland's housing associations said its members were ""reviewing their approaches to tackling mould and dampness"".","['Rochdale', 'Social housing', 'Housing', 'Health', 'Landlords', 'Manchester']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5D4C/production/_127648832_gettyimages-917892728.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13D7C/production/_132267218_mediaitem127647972.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6152/production/_127741942_7b4da376-f010-41ff-86f4-9f7562a0f106.jpg']","['By James Gregory & Tim Dodd', 'BBC News']",UK,England
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg3vp05yyddo,Birmingham has no choice over tax rise - mayor,,2024-01-10,"Birmingham City Council has “no choice” but to raise council tax significantly, according to West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.He was speaking after Labour council leader John Cotton told the BBC the council had asked the government for permission to raise council tax by up to 10% each year for the next two years.The council has a £300m gap in its budget over this period – and problems have been compounded by a £760m equal pay bill and an £80m overspend on an IT project.The Conservative mayor accepted council funding had fallen under successive Tory governments – but Mr Street said the financial situation in Birmingham was entirely down to the Labour leadership. Speaking to BBC Newscast he said: “What’s put Birmingham into this position is the equal pay claim, three quarters of a billion, that is solely because of the political decisions that Birmingham took and their failure over the last five years to recognise the consequences of that.”Asked if the council was right to ask for government permission for the huge rises, Mr Street said: ""They've got no choice. They've got no choice.""Mr Cotton had previously apologised to the people of the city over the crisis and the council said it was ""committed to resolving historic equal pay issues"". Following news of a potential 21% overall tax increase over the next two years – something that could mean roughly £400 a year on a Band D property’s bill by April 2025 – the Conservative opposition called for the Labour council leader and his cabinet to resign.Councillor Ewan Mackey, Conservative group deputy leader, told BBC Radio WM: “If you’re the one making the decisions, the buck stops with you ultimately. And you have to be held responsible for the decisions you make.”But Mr Cotton told the BBC he was committed to seeing the challenges through: “I’m Birmingham born and bred, I’ve never lived anywhere else, I’m absolutely profoundly committed to this city.”The chief executive of the council, Deborah Cadman, also insisted she would remain in post despite what lay ahead – including significant job cuts with about half of the council’s management budget set to be cut.Asked if she has thought about standing down, she said: “Absolutely not. This is the hardest job I’ve ever done but it is also a job that I’m completely committed to.” Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Farah Naz says there are ""unanswered questions"" for bosses of Belmarsh prison, the UK's most secure jail. Jordan McSweeney is serving at least 33 years for murdering the 35-year-old. The Prison Service, which runs Belmarsh, said it was aware of the alleged incident but would not comment further due to ongoing investigations. The Metropolitan Police said a 32-year-old woman was arrested in April and is being investigated over alleged misconduct in public office. It is understood she was employed to work at Belmarsh, in south-east London, but was not a prison officer. Ms Naz says she was made aware of McSweeney's relationship with the unnamed female worker last spring - and that it had started just months into his prison sentence. ""While the justice system advocates for life [sentence] for life, this incident clearly contradicts that principle,"" she told the BBC. ""The perpetrator managed to establish intimacy with a woman merely four months into his sentence, leaving us with numerous unanswered questions. ""Why was a self-confessed sexually motivated murderer, whose crime was nationally recognized for its brutality, allowed proximity to a female worker lacking training and capacity for such situations?"" Ms Aleena was murdered in June 2022 as she walked home after having drinks with a friend in Ilford, east London. McSweeney, from Dagenham, was captured on CCTV stalking the streets of Ilford approaching women before he pounced on and fatally beat Ms Aleena for nine minutes. The 30-year-old had been released from prison just nine days before the attack. He was in the process of being recalled after his licence was revoked for failing to meet probation officers. He had 28 convictions for 69 crimes, dating back to 2006, ranging from burglary to assaulting the police and including racially motivated offences. McSweeney refused to attend his sentencing at the Old Bailey when he was jailed for a minimum of 38 years. In November, three Court of Appeal judges reduced McSweeney's sentence to at least 33 years - much to the ""extreme disappointment"" of Ms Aleena's family. Ms Naz said the story about the alleged relationship was first reported in the Sun in early April and that she asked Justice Secretary Alex Chalk about it during a meeting in June. Mr Chalk had been appointed to his role in the middle of April, a few weeks after the alleged incident is said to have taken place. In the last week, the story has made headlines in other newspapers and the Met Police confirmed it had been made aware of an allegation of ""inappropriate conduct"" involving a serving member of staff at Belmarsh. The arrested woman was initially bailed until July 2023 but has since been released under investigation, the Met said. ""Enquiries are ongoing,"" the Met spokeswoman said. Belmarsh is one of only three high-security core prisons in England and Wales. Prison staff found guilty of inappropriate relationships with prisoners can be sent to prison themselves for misconduct in public office. ""It would be inappropriate to comment on a live police investigation,"" a Prison Service spokeswoman said.","['UK prisons', 'Greenwich', 'Ilford', 'London', 'Dagenham']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16BDA/production/_125664139_aleenacut.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/140D4/production/_132223128_aleenaaunt.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FFBE/production/_128007456_ef57c37c-f348-4b49-bd2b-971f19520265.jpg']","['By Thomas Mackintosh', 'BBC News']",UK,England

CCTV cameras were put up at a number of schools after North East Lincolnshire Council said too many people on the school run were parking dangerously. A total of 339 penalty charge notices (PCNs) were issued between 1 July and 30 September 2023, the authority said. Officials said it had proved to be an effective deterrent. CCTV was first installed at Signhills Academy in Cleethorpes in 2022. The scheme has since been extended to include Old Clee Primary Academy and Welholme Academy in Grimsby, and Queen Mary Infant and Nursery School in Cleethorpes. Ron Shepherd, portfolio holder for safer and stronger communities at the authority, said: ""We've seen a really positive improvement in road safety since the scheme was introduced in September 2022. ""Whilst we are seeing a number of fines continuing to be issued due to drivers not parking as the restrictions require, we have seen a change in how people drop off and collect their children. ""At Signhills Academy for example, we initially saw a number of fines issued, but since then that has dropped as people have changed their behaviour, and this is something we're hoping to continue to see at other sites."" The cameras automatically detect and enforce parking breaches at the ""keep clear"" signs outside the schools. Drivers caught stopping on the yellow zig-zag lines will be fined £70, discounted to £35 if paid within 14 days. The data is contained in a recent council report, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. It says just 4% of the 339 PCNs issued had been cancelled.

Cheshire East Council listed plans to reduce costs in a range of services it provided.The largest savings would be made in adult social care - with a £5.6m saving proposed - and children’s services, where there are proposals to save £5.2m.In its corporate services division, it listed proposals to save £4.8m.These include cutting spending on leadership by leaving vacant posts unfilled and charging parish and town councils for all parish-related elections. There were also planned saving of £3.2m by reducing staffing costs through aiming to “eliminate” agency spending as far as possible and cutting overtime payments for staff. There were proposals to save £4m in the Environmental and Communities division.This would include a review of leisure services - which will be considered by a committee in the coming weeks after a consultation - which could save £1.3m by reviewing pricing and getting contributions for services from town and parish councils.The authority was also looking to save £750,000 through a reduction of household waste sites to just have four main sites in Alsager, Crewe, Knutsford and Macclesfield, ahead of a full review of waste management later this year.The council currently also has waste sites in Bollington, Middlewich and Poynton.A garden waste collection charge - which comes into force next week at £56 - could increase to £59. Cost saving plans in highways and transport include “revising maintenance practices” in areas such as winter services, grass cutting and repair works. It said the “reduction of service levels” would bring savings, with statutory responsibilities  to be considered.The documents also asked for thoughts on other options including cutting bus subsidiaries, moving to black bin collections every three weeks and reviewing spending in arts and culture, and tourism.However these were not measures included in the current budget proposals. Cheshire East Council is currently led by a joint Labour and Independent group administration.Councillor Corcoran said: “The cost-of-living crisis isn’t just affecting individuals, rising costs are also affecting councils.”He said the council had “specific issues”, including a low level of reserves and the ""financial shock"" of the cancellation of HS2.“Labour, and the Independent group too, are absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to keep tight control of the council’s finances, and really difficult decisions will have to be made,” he added.The consultation will end on 28 January.

Plans by Veolia UK to install two new 98ft (30m) towers for managing and recycling waste in Garston, Liverpool, were approved by council planners. Almost 600 people submitted objections to the plans. One campaigner told the meeting he feared Garston would become ""a dustbin"" but Veolia rejected the criticism. Committee members approved the application after a site visit, where they asked questions of council officers and Veolia staff. Protesters gathered as the visit took place. The location has operated since 2000 and the two new towers will expand capacity by 28,000 tonnes. The facility offers companies a service for handling, cleansing, purification and recycling solvents. The plant operates around the clock, with a capacity to process 42,000 tonnes of hazardous solvent waste per year. But Veolia rejected claims it would contribute to noise, pollution and health problems in the area. Nicola Henshaw, of Veolia UK, said the development represented a ""significant investment"" of £72m and said no objections had been received from relevant bodies such as the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. But Liberal councillor Billy Lake told the meeting: ""Everything's fine until something goes wrong. I would be concerned if I lived in any proximity to the plant. ""If there was an accident there and there's noxious fumes, I'd want to know if my house was in the direction of them. It was very important when Chernobyl blew."" Campaigner Gary Woollam said he and other residents would now seek a judicial review of the decision. Through tears, he said: ""Garston needs better than this. We deserve better than this. There is no benefit or gain - all that we're going to gain is chemical risk."" Resident Barbara Marshall said: ""I am very sad. It's not going to add anything positive to Garston at all."" Garston councillor Sam Gorst accused Veolia of showing ""contempt"" for the community. However, Paul Farrell, who manages Liverpool City Council's environmental protection unit, said the impact of the site would be ""imperceptible"" despite the concerns. ""It will have no impact on the health of residents in Garston,"" he said. Four councillors voted in favour of the application while three abstained. Ms Henshaw said she was pleased with the outcome. ""It means the facility will increase its supply of recycled materials to UK businesses that have been affected by the global shortage of microchips and semiconductors,"" she said.

The blaze broke out on the roof at We The Curious in April 2022 after a solar panel was damaged by birds, triggering a fault in the electrical system. The museum had hoped to reopen in early 2024 but said supply chain delays meant this was no longer feasible. The Grade II listed museum said it aimed to provide another update in the coming weeks. The building in Millennium Square suffered significant damage in the fire and needed extensive restoration works. This included installing a new raised access floor, new electrics and mechanical items as well as new metal framed ceilings. The ground and first floors also required major redecoration due to water damage after thousands of litres of water was used to put out the fire. ""It's disappointing to have a few more months of closure ahead of us than we'd originally hoped,"" a museum spokesperson said. ""We know our audiences will be disappointed too. ""Nevertheless, we're starting the year optimistically, with the repair work moving towards the final completion phase, our staff back working in the building and new members of the team being recruited ready for reopening."" Since the fire, staff have been conducting free outreach activities in schools and communities, with over 260 events across Bristol. After the Easter holidays, teams are expected to pivot to prioritise reopening the site. ""We remain absolutely committed to reopening, but we're being ultra cautious on naming exact dates until we have greater certainty so that we don't let anyone down,"" the spokesperson said.

The GMB union said workers at the Victoria Park care home in Coventry will walk out on 24 January. The union has accused HC-One, which operates the home, of ignoring staff who raised concerns about the safety of patients and low pay. HC-One said it would ensure residents get the care needed during the strike. GMB and HC-One said the Victoria Park strike was thought to be the first industrial action taken by staff at the company in the UK. The union said the strike was backed by 100% of members who voted in the ballot, which began last month It said workers were furious about the sacking of a care home manager, who had raised safety concerns about the referral of hospital outpatients to the 32-bed home. The BBC has been told the manager's dismissal was upheld after her appeal was rejected. The staff who voted for strike action wanted the manager reinstated and an agreement on managing the referral of hospital patients. GMB organiser Kate Gorton said the ballot result showed ""the depth of workers' anger at the way they've been treated"". She said: ""HC-One have a clear choice in front of them: face strike chaos or do the right thing by residents, workers and the community and re-instate a care worker that was cruelly and unfairly dismissed"". In a statement, a Victoria Park spokesperson said HC-One would ""never penalise a colleague for raising concerns and will always take action if needed to improve our policies or practice"". ""The change in leadership at the home was subject to a full and thorough HR process and was completed in line with our performance policy,"" the spokesperson said. ""We hold all our colleagues and leaders to the highest standards of professionalism and leadership, and will always act in the best interests of our residents."" The spokesperson said HC-One had taken ""immediate action"" to address concerns about the number of beds available for hospital outpatients, with changes communicated to all colleagues, and added: ""We have not been made aware of any further concerns."" With about 270 homes across the country, HC-One is one of the biggest residential care providers in the UK. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England

Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear.""

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

The poles were erected in an area of Hedon which has Scheduled Monument status, as part of a government scheme to improve fibre broadband coverage. However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,England
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible.

Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on the vessel, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, on 12 December. Mr Farruku's body had been repatriated to his native Albania for burial after his family raised more than £18,000 through an online appeal. A pre-inquest hearing was told there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the 27-year-old's death.

The Home Office has said it takes ""very seriously"" the welfare of those on board the vessel. However, following the funeral in Tirana, which was attended by small crowd of family and friends, Mr Farruku's aunt told Reuters her nephew had said conditions on board were not good.

An imam chanted prayers and family members cried out as Mr Farruku's coffin was lowered into a grave, Reuters reported. Mr Farruku's roommate, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, has told BBC News other barge residents might harm themselves if conditions on board did not improve. He said there had been complaints about poor quality food, cold showers, unreliable wi-fi and concerns not being dealt with. He said: ""They're saying Leonard's death is just the beginning. ""They are trying to give a warning. That place is not good for them. Every day their stress is increasing, getting worse.""

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-67939921,Tan Hill Inn: Accused said 'goodnight sweetheart' and pulled trigger,"A man accused of attempted murder said ""goodnight sweetheart"" as he held a gun against another man's head, only for the weapon to misfire, a court heard.",2024-01-10,"A man accused of attempted murder said ""goodnight sweetheart"" as he held a gun against another man's head, only for the weapon to misfire, a court heard. Richard Bowser is accused of attempting to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. Mr Jackson tried to escape after the gun failed to discharge but was shot in the arm moments later, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. The court had previously heard Mr Bowser had been involved in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after becoming aggressive when his bank card was declined. During the fight he assaulted three people, including Mr Jackson's brother-in-law, Karl Pearson, before being ejected. Giving evidence, Mr Jackson told the court his wife had later asked him to go and check on Mr Pearson. He said he had found him in his camper van ""shook up"", with ""bloodshot eyes"" and blood on his face. He told the jury he had then gone to a glamping pod on the site where Mr Bowser was staying. ""In my head I was making sure there was nobody else hurt or needed help,"" he said. Defending, Alistair MacDonald KC, however, said Mr Jackson deliberately went looking for Mr Bowser. ""It's not a coincidence that you happened to stride straight towards the pod where Mr Bowser was staying and your immediate thought was to get in,"" he told him. Mr Jackson said he ""did not know"" who Mr Bowser was at that time or where he was staying. He claimed the defendant ""came at me aggressively"" after he had ""just had a nosey through the gaps in the fence"". ""The gate flung open, he came straight out and said: 'You have come for me',"" he told the jury. ""There was no reasoning with him, I was scared. I tried to get away."" Mr Jackson said he told the defendant he was looking for the toilet, to which he replied: ""I'll take you to the toilet"". He said he had been ""petrified"" as they walked down a path towards a bathroom. It was there where Mr Bowser produced what Mr Jackson initially thought was a toy gun and held it to his head. ""He said: 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and pulled the trigger,"" said Mr Jackson. ""The gun didn't go off. He looked surprised [and] went to do something to the gun. ""I think I then came slightly out of shock, realised it was a real gun, maybe, then bolted away."" He said he had fled to a nearby bunk room and locked the door behind him. Once inside he said more shots were fired at the door and then he noticed blood dripping down his right hand and called the police. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

Melissa Zoglie went to A&E at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in April 2023 with acute abdominal pain, but doctors did not realise her stomach was twisted, and she was sent home. Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyxv210ex7wo,Sub-postmaster quits after Post Office TV drama,,2024-01-10,"A sub-postmaster has decided to close his branch after being ""reduced to tears"" by a TV drama about the Post Office accounting scandal. Graham Livesey - who also experienced issues with the Horizon software - said he would be closing the branch in Staveley, near Kendal, Cumbria, in July. Mr Livesey said it had been a ""hard decision"" but he could no longer work with the Post Office, which is wholly-owned by the government.A spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, and added it was ""committed"" to continuing its work to transform the Post Office. The Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from the Horizon system, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing.The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a new law on Wednesday to ""swiftly"" exonerate the victims. Mr Livesey took on the branch in 2009 and said there had been no problems for about a year, until ""all of a sudden"" he began having shortages. Because of his IT background, Mr Livesey said he suspected network errors and contacted the Horizon helpdesk.""I was told it must be a branch error and I was the only one,"" he said. ""In consequence, I realised that at that point in time I was lied to."" Mr Livesey told BBC Radio Cumbria that he suffered ""minor losses"" over the years but was able to pay the money back ""on each occasion"".""It's been frequent errors and intermittent errors which have caused this, and every single time it's just a build up with me repaying and repaying,"" he said. Mr Livesey was eventually compensated, but he said it was watching ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".""It was enough to reduce me to tears. I was bawling my eyes out all the way through,"" he said.""It was just incredible that the Post Office went to the lengths to defend the brand name. ""It's something that I can't go back to and I can't work with them anymore.""Mr Livesey said he had given the Post Office six months' notice and his branch, which is the only one in the village, would close in July. ""It was a very hard decision to make. I've been keeping the Post office running for years now,"" he said.""There was a lot to take in, but on the balance of everything, I have to live with my own conscience and my conscience is clear."" A Post Office spokesperson urged anyone affected to come forward and added: “We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both the Post Office and the Government are committed to full and fair compensation which puts people back in the position they would have been in had these events not taken place.""

The car was parked at a Premier Inn in Chiswick, which said its security cameras did not capture the incident. The triple-amputee is a gold-medal winning Invictus Games athlete and was appointed MBE for his services to the Royal Marines and veterans. Premier Inn says it is looking into what happened. Mr Ormrod, who filmed the damage to his car, said it had not been the best start to his day. He posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Had my car broken into last night. ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!"" He added: ""Despite having 3 cameras pointing at my car I was told by the staff at the hotel that they couldn't see any activity as the view to my car was blocked by another car (might be time to reposition those cameras). ""The sad thing is to think that someone would break into a car parked in a disabled parking space and steal equipment someone needs to live independently and not even care."" Mr Ormrod was serving in Afghanistan in 2007 when he was hit by an improvised explosive device. It resulted in the amputation of both legs and his right arm. Since then, he has gone on to work for The Royal Marines Charity, and has used his own experiences to help other injured service personnel. He was awarded the BBC South West Sports Personality of the Year award for 2018 for his participation in the Invictus Games.

However, Historic England said consent had not been granted ahead of the work. Broadband operator MS3, responsible for the poles, said it was now working on finding ""the most suitable location"". Last year, hundreds of people in Hedon protested against the installation of new telegraph poles in residential streets. Changes to the law since April 2022 mean operators can erect poles without having to apply to councils for planning permission. However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place.""

However, according to the government, scheduled monument consent is needed to carry out work that would demolish, damage, remove, repair, alter or add to a scheduled monument. This can be obtained from Historic England, on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Carrying out work without such consent is classed as a criminal offence. Historic England said it had been made aware of the poles in Hedon late last year and work to put up more poles had been halted. The scheduled area includes a pre-1979 housing estate and three of the poles had been erected without the necessary consent, the public body said. A Historic England spokesperson said: ""Historic England is working with broadband contractors MS3 to understand the archaeological impact caused by the positioning of these poles. ""We are looking to relocate them outside of the scheduled area but if any of the additional poles can only be located within the scheduled area, we will work with MS3 to ensure the right permissions and mitigation is in place."" Guy Miller, chief executive of MS3 Networks, said the poles were saving residents more than £1m per year. He said the company was working with Historic England to ensure the most suitable location for the telegraph poles.

Fifteen-month-old Olly Stopforth, from Frodsham, died two days after being discharged from the Countess of Chester Hospital in March 2020. He had a streptococcal infection, which led to sepsis and a viral infection. A jury inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court found medics could have saved him if tests had been carried out. In a statement read out by the coroner the hospital trust said it had improved since Olly's death and was now using the national guidelines on sepsis testing. A solicitor for Olly's parents, Laura and Karl Stopforth, said it had been ""incredibly painful and difficult"" for them to hear from hospital professionals that more should have been done to properly diagnose and treat their son. They felt their son was ""not considered as a priority when he was in hospital"" and they had been ""very upset to hear that the medical staff trusted with their little boy's care did not provide him with adequate medical attention"". ""No parent should lose their young child as they have, it is especially painful because they lost their beautiful boy in preventable circumstances,"" the solicitor added, saying the family would be pursuing a medical negligence claim against the trust. The inquest jury accepted the Covid-19 pandemic had made things harder for staff during the time when Olly was being treated. It heard that hospital staff were under pressure because the pandemic had just started and they were unsure about how it would affect children or how long patients should be kept in hospital. But the jury found the baby was not adequately cared for at the hospital, as doctors thought he only had a viral infection and did not carry out tests that could have shown he was suffering from the more serious bacterial infection. Olly was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital after becoming ill at home and a video consultation with a GP who suspected he had a viral infection. One of the paramedics who took him to hospital thought Olly had ""grossly abnormal"" signs and was ""very poorly"", as he had a rash, a high temperature and a high heart rate. Olly remained at the Accident and Emergency Department for nearly six hours before being transferred to a ward, and was discharged four hours later. His mum Laura found him dead in bed two days later. A consultant paediatrician at the Countess of Chester, Dr Alison Timmis, told the inquest no steps had been taken to rule out a bacterial infection. She agreed that if Olly had been given antibiotics it was ""very likely"" he would have survived. An expert witness told the inquest she did not understand why a sepsis screening tool had not been used at the hospital. Another expert, microbiologist Prof Vav Cartwright, said in a statement: ""Almost any intravenous antibiotic or antibiotic combination likely to have been employed would have been highly active against streptococcus."" ""On the balance of probabilities Olly would have required a two-week course of antibiotics, after which he would have made a full recovery,"" she added. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said it was her sincere hope the trust had learnt serious lessons. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

Janine Powell, now 52, was wrongfully accused of stealing £74,000 from her branch in Tiverton, Devon. She was sacked and arrested, before being convicted at a trial in Exeter in 2008. She maintained her innocence but was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving five months. Ms Powell said the hardest part of her wrongful jailing had been leaving her children. ""You're stuck behind these four walls in a little room,"" she said. ""You get phone calls to find out what's happening outside with the children. ""I've missed out on doing things with them - I can't get that back."" The Post Office Horizon scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. What happened between 1999 and 2015 is now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. After Ms Powell was released from prison, she spent a further three months wearing a tag. She moved away from Tiverton, but said she could not escape feelings of guilt on her visits back to Devon. ""Even though people were being nice to you, saying 'I know you didn't do it', you know that as soon as you walk away, they're talking about it, saying that you've done it,"" she said. ""You feel guilty."" Some sub-postmasters, like Ms Powell, wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined and forced to declare bankruptcy - and some have since died. The Metropolitan Police is investigating possible fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the Horizon scandal - to which Ms Powell has given evidence - is continuing. The government is now facing increasing calls to bring forward emergency legislation to deal with the scandal and ministers said they would introduce plans to speed up the process ""shortly"". The former Justice Secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, said: ""Perhaps there should be a presumption that all those people who were convicted are in fact not guilty. ""We could go further and simply quash the convictions and render them absolutely void, so that then we're in a position whereby the sort of complications that are hitting the compensation process can be avoided."" Ms Powell's conviction was quashed, along with many others in 2022. She says, for her, details of compensation are not the issue. What she most wants is for the Post Office to ""hold their hands up"" and ""admit they were wrong"". Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Michael Rudkin's wife Susan was wrongly convicted of stealing money, while he lost his job and union position. The couple, who are featured in an ITV drama about the scandal, ran a branch in Leicestershire. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said new legislation will ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". The Post Office  prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses between 1999 and 2015 based on information from IT system Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Sunak announced on Wednesday victims would be able to sign a form to say they were innocent in order to have their convictions overturned and claim compensation. Mr Rudkin, who was played by Shaun Dooley in Mr Bates vs the Post Office, ran the Ibstock branch of the Post Office with his wife. Mrs Rudkin, who is too upset to speak publicly at the moment, was convicted of losing £44,000, given a suspended sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours community service while being electronically tagged. Her husband said: ""If you could even remotely think of what hell would look like, then multiply that by 10, that is how our lives have been the last 15 years, absolute hell. ""It doesn't get much worse than your wife contemplating suicide."" Reacting to the announcement of new legislation, Mr Rudkin said: ""I was pleased [by] the overall principle of making sure that everybody has this blanket overturning of convictions because they've waited far too long for this. ""On top of which, to be compensated, let's see what the detail is. ""It feels as though we're heading in the right direction. After 20 years, I hasten to add."" His wife's conviction was overturned in April 2021 but people's perception of them as a couple did not change dramatically, Mr Rudkin previously told the BBC. However, since the programme - which put the scandal in the spotlight - was broadcast people who he had not spoken to in 20 years have been getting in touch. Mr Rudkin added: ""From feeling castigated throughout your community and your friends... all of a sudden, I'm getting messages from people who I haven't spoken to for 20 years saying 'we saw the programme, we didn't realise. So sorry'."" He said he now wants recompense for their loss of earnings and compensation. The couple dismissed a previous compensation offer which Mr Rudkin called ""obscene"". A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are acutely aware of the human cost of the scandal and are doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past, as far as that is possible. ""Both Post Office and government are committed to providing full, fair and final compensation for the people affected. ""To date, offers of compensation totalling more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 postmasters, the majority of which have been agreed and paid.""

The proposed Exmouth station, to include a public inquiry desk, was given £5m funding in June 2023. But Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez, said a survey delay was ""driving her batty"". East Devon District Council confirmed bats had held up surveys and planning application processing. A spokesperson added: ""As the proposal involves demolishing the existing police station, further wildlife surveys are required to confirm if there are any legally protected species in the building that would be affected. ""On-site surveys cannot currently take place, as this may disturb hibernating bats, with surveys usually done from around April onwards. ""Until the impact of this demolition is understood, and suggestions to reduce any impacts are provided, the council is not allowed to grant planning permission."" It said the council had offered ""pre-application advice"" for a fee, so other elements such as design and impacts on highways and surrounding buildings, need not be impacted by the delay. Ms Hernandez previously said the station site would be redeveloped and a modern facility built for officers and staff. This week on social media she said: ""Bats stall my office's planning application for the new Exmouth Police Station. ""I have to wait until roosting season May-Sept to carry out a survey before East Devon District Council will even register the planning application. It's driving me batty! Can't blame the bats though."" The closure of the station to the public in 2015 was criticised but it has remained an operational base. The new station is due to be be financed by the sale of part of the existing site in North Street. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Residents spoke to the BBC as the country continues to reel from what has been dubbed the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. It played its ""own little part in that history,"" said Kate Carless, the hall's current treasurer, with the village attracting visitors, some even stopping to take selfies outside the hall. ""I'm no longer the bookings secretary for the village hall, I'm more like its agent at the moment,"" Ms Carless adds. It is here where between 30 and 40 ex sub-postmasters and mistresses met for the first time one Sunday in 2009 - a gathering that led to the creation of the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) campaign group. The occasion was the first time many of them discovered they weren't alone in having fallen victim to the bugs in an accounting system called Horizon. The man who orchestrated that meeting was Alan Bates - now in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - for fraudulent activity, based on information from Horizon. Many, including Mr Bates, maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues about errors in the accounting software. But some went to prison for false accounting and theft, many were financially ruined, and some even took their own lives or died before getting a chance to clear their names. However, despite the avalanche of new publicity around the scandal, only 93 of them have had their convictions overturned. Now, a fresh police investigation into the Post Office and the way it pursued the cases has been launched, with 50 new potential victims coming forward. Former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells is also handing back her CBE with immediate effect, after a petition exceeded a million signatures. The TV drama and subsequent publicity has now really ""put the village in the spotlight,"" said Ms Carless. ""We've had people driving past the village hall quite slowly taking photos,"" she said. ""But it's a shame it has had to get to this for those people that have been affected. ""When you started watching the drama you were thinking how could this have happened to people."" In the drama Mr Bates, played by Toby Jones, can be seen seemingly choosing somewhere random for affected sub-postmasters to meet. ""Putting that pin into the map seems to have ignited both the residents and other people, who know that I live here, to get in touch,"" said village hall trustee Keith Hicks. He said he had heard of people taking selfies outside the hall, ""which seems quite amazing"". The hall wasn't used in the filming of the drama, he explained, ""but I can appreciate with the parking issues around here that it wouldn't be easy to bring a production team in"". He said he didn't remember the meeting in 2009, describing it as ""very low key"". ""It wasn't until I listened to the BBC Radio 4 podcast, The Great Post Office Trial, that I realised the significance that this little hall had played in the whole story,"" he said. ""These people were the life and soul of the community and then they were damned by the Post Office without any thought that they may be right. ""The fact that they came together here in the very first place, and realised that they weren't single entities, I think it's very significant."" Other local residents said they had also been amazed at the part their village played in the story. ""When you see him look at the map it's just amazing to think that they came here - it's a proud moment for the little people,"" said Alan Booth. Cindy Williams added there was the start of a local campaign to get Mr Bates back to the village for a visit. ""That would be so interesting, quite honestly,"" she said.

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. Allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank, an inquest into his death heard. There is no evidence to suggest Mr Atkinson alerted staff to his allergy. The 23-year-old, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary an hour after ingesting peanuts. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen section of Dadyal's food safety management documents was blank. Mr Atkinson's flatmate, Luke Isley, previously gave evidence saying that the Newcastle University graduate had raised concerns about what he was eating as little as 30 seconds after beginning to eat his pizza, which sparked panic among his friends when he mentioned peanuts. By the time paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"", according to Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, who said he was ""profoundly unconscious"" by the time he was helped downstairs. He died in hospital less than an hour later. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts.

After the assault, Pur had told the girl not to tell anyone, the court heard. When confronted by the girl's father, he denied anything had happened, jurors were told. Sentencing, Judge Graham Reeds KC stated Pur had lied throughout the case, adding the victim should have been safe in her own home.

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now."" She said there were many people who ""thoroughly and richly deserve these awards"" but the system was ""devalued"" by others. ""The fact is the honours is broken and needs a complete overhaul by No 10 and onwards to the monarch who rubber stamps what happens,"" she said. ""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said. ""I'm a tiny voice in all of this but I just wanted to stand in solidarity with these people who I can't even begin to comprehend what they've been through."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X  and Facebook.

Prof Sarah Gabbott, of the University of Leicester, said there were countless numbers of aluminium cans and plastic bottles washed up by the River Soar. She said: ""The litter clogs up the river and causes even more flooding."" Prof Gabbott wants to educate people that litter is ""killing wildlife"" and ""ruining our beautiful river"". The professor, who researches plastic pollution in the environment, also spotted kitchen lino, fire extinguishers, car bumpers, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), tricycles, footballs, barbecues, and part of a kitchen cupboard in the wake of Storm Henk. She said: ""We had these incredible floods and what has happened is the water of the River Soar has risen, broken over the banks, and all the material that was in the river has been washed across the flood plain and now it is stranded so we can see it. ""It is very bad. I've travelled to a lot of developing countries to look at the plastic problems there and I'll be honest, this would fit in with those places and those places don't have waste management systems like we do here."" She says it spoils beautiful green spaces, the litter itself builds up and causes additional flooding, and it is terrible for wildlife and for ecology. Prof Gabbott added litter dropped on the streets often ended up washed into the river due to the rain. She said the flooding had ""brought into stark focus the appalling legacy of litter that Leicester's River Soar carries through our city and onwards into the Trent and then the North Sea"". Prof Gabbott, who saw the rubbish in the Ellis Meadows area while volunteering with the Green Circle Nature Regeneration CIC, added: ""I am shocked by the sheer abundance of litter that is now scattered across the river banks and snared on trees and bushes in the city where I live. ""It is like our dirty litter has been hung out to dry where we can all witness it."" She said ""you can almost not see the foliage"". ""It is just festooned in blue, white, red plastic bags, and material of all different colours and types,"" she said. ""It looks almost like there's a landfill, which has just been shoved into the River Soar. It's horrendous."" She said: ""What we really need is to stop it happening in the first place and that's where education is critical. I know that the city council are doing work around education, then there are various voluntary groups. ""We're taking kids out on the river on a boat, teaching them about the river, how it works, about nature, about the environment and how important it is. ""Hopefully they'll talk to their friends and family and stop this kind of littering happening again."" Chris Desai, founder of Leicester environmental charity UOcean, which cleans up waterways, said: ""We see this kind of pollution every day. ""When I saw it, I was just 'that's the River Soar and that's why we do this' but for the public to see, they are shocked beyond belief. ""We have been saying this is a problem for the past three years. ""We are going to keep highlighting the fact that our rivers in Leicester need our help."" Leicester City Council workers and volunteers have been cleaning up the land by the river over the last few days, and said clearing litter from the waterways was a constant challenge. Victoria Hudson, from the council, said: ""The efforts will be continually ongoing because this is just one of many sites along the eight-and-a-half mile stretch of the city's River Soar. ""As soon as we can get the boats back out on water, we will be back out with our volunteers as ever."" She added: ""We go the extra mile at Leicester and we have a fleet of boats.

In October, Wiltshire Police launched a review into 3,582 disclosure requests made under Clare's Law since 2015. Chief Constable Catherine Roper said the review had identified two people who had come to harm which could have been prevented. The initial review is expected to be completed in the coming days. Wiltshire Police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after it emerged people might have been given wrong information after they made applications for information under Clare's Law. Wiltshire was a pilot area for the scheme, which allows people to ask if their partner has an abusive past. Ms Roper said it had been ""a catastrophic service failure"" and apologised again for the failings, saying ""we have let people down"". She added: ""There was a key time between April 2015 and August 2023 where we identified that Clare's Law applications had not been processed as they should have been, and there were potentially people who had been put at risk as a result. ""Out of those 3,582 (applications) we identified two people who we believe have come to harm which may have been able to have been prevented had Clare's Law applications been processed as they should have been."" The Chief Constable said ""no stone would be left unturned"" and that anyone found to be responsible for failings would be held to account. She added that action plans would be put in place for any applications in which ""next steps"" need to be taken, and there would be further updates when all applications and risk assessments had been completed. ""My response is being led by the Deputy Chief Constable Craig Dibdin. I have told him that no stone will be left unturned so who knew what, who did what, when was it happening and what was our process,"" added Ms Roper. Former Met commander Ms Roper was speaking to BBC Radio Wiltshire as part of a wide-ranging interview on a number of topics. She took over from the retiring Kier Pritchard in February 2023 when the force was in special measures, and although it remains in the same position, she believes that performance is improving. Ms Roper said should would not commit a time for when the force would come out of special measures, but added: ""I do believe we are significantly down that improvement journey now."" She said she thought ""considerable improvements"" had been made and that Wiltshire Police is in a better position that it was 12 months ago. The chief constable said resources had been put into making police more visible and that arrests and successful prosecutions for crimes including domestic abuse and burglary had increased.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-67836727,Derbyshire farmer fears he will be turfed off land for solar farm,A Derbyshire farmer fears he could lose his livelihood if plans for a solar farm go ahead.,2024-01-10,"A Derbyshire farmer fears he could lose his livelihood if plans for a solar farm go ahead. Andrew Dakin is the third generation of tenant farmers who have worked the land at Kidsley Farm, near Heanor. But plans for a new solar farm could see all his farming land sold off and solar panels put in place instead. Mr Dakin said it would be impossible for him to continue farming if Amber Valley Borough Council granted permission for the solar farm. The solar farm, which would be built on Mr Dakin's land, is one of two applications for neighbouring solar farms north of Derby and Smalley, which would sit 500m apart and cover an area of 328 acres. Mr Dakin said the farm on his land, which would span 180 acres, would take away all the fields he uses to rear cattle for beef and leave only the house he lives in. He told the BBC he would be enormously sad if he was forced to stop farming. He said: ""It's a way of life. It means absolutely everything and it would be devastating to see it go for a solar farm. ""It's all I've ever done - I've never been on holiday since I was 15 because I love being on the farm and I don't want to be anywhere else."" A spokesman for the solar farm developer, Intelligent Alternatives, said issues relating to land ownership and tenancy were private commercial matters. He said building on greenbelt land was allowed in special circumstances, such as tackling climate change, and pledged the land would be reinstated for agriculture afterwards. The spokesman added the full planning applications would not be submitted until after January and the community and councils would be kept informed. Amy Wheelton, who is a tenant farmer and local councillor who also sits on South Derbyshire District Council's planning committee, said she was alarmed at the number of applications being made for solar farms on agricultural land. ""Solar can be good,"" she said. ""I've no argument with somebody wanting to put it on their chicken sheds or their business. ""But you can have farmers that have been three generations farming, as I have on my tenanted land - some have invested millions in their businesses - and like that it's gone. ""There's no security of tenure and it's just wrong."" Ms Wheelton has solar panels covering her office rooftops and said it was ""crackers"" to use agricultural land for solar farms, as there was enough south-facing roof space in the UK to produce half the country's energy needs. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said the issue of tenant farmers being turfed off their land for solar farms was a ""huge and growing issue"" and called for a national database of solar schemes to illustrate the scale of the issue. He said: ""People are losing their businesses here for a pittance in terms of compensation. ""We're worried that food security is being damaged by the amount of land we're potentially going to see lost to solar schemes. ""We would much prefer this being put on to roofs of buildings and farm buildings and having microgeneration rather than these huge schemes taking the best and most versatile agricultural land out of production."" However, Sam Richards of Britain Remade, said moving quickly to renewable energy ""simply has to happen"". He said: ""If we truly believe that we have a climate emergency, if we really want to cut our energy bills, then fundamentally we're going to need to build.""

He spoke out against ""creating acres of steel and concrete in areas of profound natural beauty"". Fiennes, known for his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter franchise, said: ""[National Grid's] proposals involve a complex of electrical infrastructure with landfall at Aldeburgh, Walberswick, Southwold towards two vast electrical hubs, built inland destroying many acres of heathland and habitat, coastline and wetland irreversibly."" He also said neighbouring North Sea-sharing countries had harnessed wind power through integrated offshore networks. SEAS founder Fiona Gilmore said the star had offered to help before writing a script and filming with director Charles Sturridge. ""He feels passionately - he is a Suffolk lad and he could have been a farmer [but] he ended up being an actor,"" she said. ""We are incredibly grateful because it's the sort of film that makes me cry. ""We're hoping that hearing Ralph Fiennes talk about those offshore solutions and saying that they are viable, you can do them tomorrow... we think that people might sit up and listen."" Campaigners said they feared construction work on underground cables, a proposed energy hub at Friston and converter station near Saxmundham would not only be a blight to the countryside and residents, but also have a detrimental impact on tourism. They argued a better option was an offshore grid with substations on brownfield sites, such as Bradwell in Essex, and closer to demand. It could also mean proposals for 112-mile long (180km) route of pylons from Norwich in Norfolk via Bramford in Suffolk to Tilbury in Essex could be revised. Fiennes released his film on the same day National Grid met local politicians, MPs and community representatives in Friston. Jake Rigg, from National Grid's Electricity System Operator division, said the authority was conducting an independent study to look at all options and ""put some facts into the debate"". In a statement, National Grid disputed Fiennes' claims that an offshore solution would be cheaper, based on costs it published in 2023, and said an environmental impact assessment would be included in any plans. ""The existing electricity transmission network was built in the 1960s and was not designed to transport the clean, green, renewable energy from where it is generated out at sea, to homes and businesses across the country,"" the statement said. ""The Great Grid Upgrade is the largest overhaul of the grid in generations, and as electricity demand is set to double, it is a critical part of how the UK can lower energy bills, combat climate change, and reach net zero."" The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said householders living near any new infrastructure could receive up to £1,000 off their electricity bills. It said: ""Offshore wind will play a key part in delivering the transition to net zero, but without the development of necessary networks onshore, this ambition cannot be achieved, threatening energy security and increasing costs for hard-working families.""

The changes could be implemented at Taunton's Vivary Park, Wellington Park and Blenheim Gardens in Minehead. They are the only three parks owned and operated by Somerset Council to be locked at night. The council said no decisions had been made but it was ""in an unprecedented position due to rising costs"". Leaving the park gates unlocked is one of a number of money-saving measures being considered by the council to fill a £100m gap in its budget for 2024/5. People using Vivary Park had mixed thoughts on the possible change. One cyclist said: ""It drives me mad [when they lock the gates] because I cycle home from work every day through the park and I've been locked in more than once. ""I know the council is in huge difficulty and as a cost-saving measure I'd much rather they left the gates open than cut care for older people."" But other residents shared concerns with BBC Radio Somerset about vandalism. A spokesperson for Somerset Council said: ""We understand there will be concerns. ""To be clear, no decisions have been made and will not be until the budget is set at full council on 20 February. ""If we cannot set a balanced budget, government commissioners will do it for us, without the local knowledge or concern about the longer term.

Emily Wadds' daughter, Lydia, has a profound and multiple learning disability, is non-verbal, a full-time wheelchair user and has epilepsy. But after accessing the charity Soundabout, Mrs Wadds said: ""I don't think I've ever known her better."" Mrs Wadds, from Trowbridge, said that learning about Lydia's expressions and noises has helped bring them together. The pair have been accessing Soundabout's online music sessions for around four years. ""Music has brought us much, much closer together,"" Mrs Wadds, 52, told BBC Radio Wiltshire. ""She's non verbal, so she doesn't talk, but just to hear her voice, I really can recognise her happy noises now - she does this little cluck."" Regular seizures meant that Lydia made little noise in her early years, but with music in Lydia's life, Mrs Wadds said she has seen a real difference in her daughter. ""We barely got any noise from her, she didn't laugh for years,"" she said. ""Now she makes lots of different noises that she never did before and I think it's given her confidence to make the noises, she's exploring more with her vocal cords."" Mrs Wadds said that discovering Soundabout also gave her the opportunity to enjoy time with Lydia. ""When she was little I was watching her all the time,"" she said. ""It was all about making sure she was safe, looking out for seizures, monitoring seizures, videoing seizures, talking about seizures - it was all health related. ""Finding Soundabout, I watch her, but it's for an enjoyable purpose - looking at her eyes and looking at her expressions, listening to her noises. ""I think it's one of the most important things in her life actually - music and food."" Rebecca Thomas has worked in special educational needs music for 15 years after studying music at Goldsmiths, University of London. She now works as a Soundabout family support coordinator. ""Music is so universal, it connects people in so many different ways,"" Miss Thomas said. ""It doesn't matter what language you speak or how you communicate - whether you communicate with vocalisations, without vocalisations, body language - music enhances all of those interactions.

The developments are taking place at Keel Row Shopping Centre, which was acquired by the council in July.

Speaking at a recent council meeting, Labour councillor Anna Watson said that clothing retailer Bonmarché was closing its Blyth shop due to Keel Row shutting down.She accused the council of not doing enough to keep businesses in the town.“I can see the long-term vision, but I worry that there will be nothing left by then,"" she said.""We could become a ghost town.” The council said that businesses in the area, including Market Place, have remained open for business and have been promoted by the council.Additional lighting was also installed in the area following feedback from local businesses.A spokesman for the council added: “Blyth really will be an enviable market town again, once developments reach completion. “Tenants at Keel Row Shopping Centre have been kept informed at every stage and the county council is working with all affected parties to provide support and to see if they can relocate in the town centre wherever possible, should they wish to do so, and offer support to employees.""

Albion Sports said it would be ""brilliant to finally find a home"". Founded in 1974, Albion Sports Association Football Club began as a Sunday league club. Currently the team play at Horsfall Stadium as part of a ground share with Bradford (Park Avenue). The club says the move would be a ""milestone"" in its history, creating a new home for the first team as well as a ""vital training and development facility for the youth and junior teams,"" according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The planning application submitted to Bradford Council is for a new changing pavilion, turnstile entrance, first aid room, new portable toilet block and two new shelters for managers and substitutes. There would also be LED flood-lights, a five-metre high fence to catch balls and a new 58-space car park. Plans for the changing pavilion include a lounge, kitchen, storerooms, changing rooms with showers and toilets, and a baby change area. A spokesman for the club said: ""Everyone associated with the club are all looking forward to the next milestone in the club's history.

The ""Skyline"" course has been closed to the public since 2019 and did not reopen after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Labour-led council said it had not been able to find a suitable operator to reopen the attraction. And the council's opposing Conservative group said it was disappointing, but the facility had fallen into disrepair. The 30ft (9m) structure was built in 2015 as part of a £3.4m scheme to improve facilities at the park. It closed two years later due to vandalism, but reopened for one season operated by Derbyshire County Council as part of an initiative with the city council. Councillor Hardyal Dhindsa, the cabinet member for communities, said the cost of keeping the site safe was not sustainable. He said: ""We are very disappointed that we have not been able to reopen the Skyline high ropes course at Markeaton Park following the Covid pandemic. ""This has been due to a number of factors, including difficulties identifying a suitable operator combined with the cost of repairs that would be required. ""We have made every effort to find a way to bring the facility back into use but, following detailed consideration, we have concluded that the best way forward is to remove it from the park."" Councillor Kieran Morgan-McGeehan, who represents the local Allestree ward, said he was disappointed the council had been unable to find someone to operate it. He said: ""It's sad to see the state that it is in. What should be full of happy laughter and happy faces is just desolate and just swinging in the wind. ""As an ongoing commercial concern, without specialist knowledge to maintain it, I understand why you wouldn't express an interest. It's a liability in the state that it is in.""

Officers from North Yorkshire Police came to the rescue of a cyclist who had gone into cardiac arrest on the A63 near Selby on Christmas Eve. They performed CPR on the 58-year-old man and treated a head injury before he was airlifted to hospital in Hull. Acting Chief Constable Elliot Foskett said their actions ""undoubtedly had a positive impact on saving a life"". ""The three officers have acted in the highest traditions of the police service,"" Mr Foskett said. ""As police officers, we swear an oath to protect our communities and this doesn't stop when we are off duty."" The cyclist, who had been travelling between Selby and Hull at about 12:30 GMT when the incident took place, continued to recover in hospital. A force spokesperson said: ""This story is an excellent example of how vital it is to learn CPR, it can literally save a life. ""You don't have to be a police officer to know how to restart a heart."" The officers are understood to have treated the man for 45 minutes. According to the British Heart Foundation, more than 30,000 people have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the UK every year, with fewer than one in ten people surviving.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67938183,Monuments in Northern Ireland: Man fined £50k for demolishing kilns,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim.",2024-01-10,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim. Henry James Price, from Glenavy Road, Lisburn, recently pleaded guilty to destroying a set of 19th Century lime kilns on land he owned in Moneybroom. The judge said it was the first prosecution of its kind in Northern Ireland. Fining Price, he said saying there must be a deterrent to dissuade others. The judge at Craigavon Crown Court added that the defendant's culpability was high given he knew the kilns were protected yet he still chose to cause ""irreparable damage"" to them. During the case, the court was told that 64-year-old Price is both a farmer and a director of a successful house building firm, JH Price and Sons Ltd. He bought the site on Moneybroom Road for £270,000 in June 2019.  It is close to his home and he was already in possession of some adjoining land. In August 2020, Price lodged an application with the council to secure the site and potentially develop a small portion of it, but the project was hit by delays. His site contained a large, protected structure known as the Moneybroom lime kilns. There were a number of limestone quarries in the Lisburn area and during the Victorian era kilns were built to produce lime for the agriculture and construction industries. The court heard that a chartered architect estimated it would have cost about £630,000 to restore the kilns to their original condition. Because they were protected monuments, a grant of up to £50,000 would have been available towards the restoration, but that still left Price facing a substantial bill. On 16 April 2021, police were called to the site following a report of building works taking place where protected monuments were situated. Officers discovered the kilns had been demolished and when they interviewed Price in September that year, he admitted he had ordered his employees to clear them. He apologised for destroying the kilns at that time, but told police he believed they were ""structurally dangerous"". Price also claimed to police there had been significant antisocial behaviour at the site, particularly at night and ""he was afraid of someone getting killed"". The Moneybroom kilns were most likely constructed between 1870 and 1900, according to an estimate by the Historic Environment Division (HED), an agency within Stormont's Department of Communities. The judge said these were the only kilns of their type in Northern Ireland and were ""an almost unique example of this type of industrial architecture"". In a mitigation plea, a defence barrister said Price ""accepts without reservation that he made a grave error and that the demolition of the lime kilns should never have taken place"". But he added that ""the integrity of the kilns was not jealously guarded by the department over the years"", pointing out there had been a lack of investment and no departmental plan to restore them. The barrister said his client had spent about £50,000 to secure the site and replant trees. He added Price had also lost his single farm payment and ""by virtue of his conduct it is now simply not possible for the defendant to develop the site in any way that would generate any profit - he has closed that particular avenue off for good"". The judge acknowledged that the kilns were not visible from the road, were not a money-generating tourist attraction and that their value was subjective. He also conceded that with no plan to repair them, they would eventually have fallen apart by themselves. Nevertheless, he said there had to be a deterrent to dissuade others who ""may be tempted to play fast and loose"" with legislation protecting other historical monuments. Giving Price credit for his guilty pleas and clear record, the judge told the defendant that if had he not admitted the offence, the fine would have been £75,000. Price was allowed six months to pay. In a statement, Brian McKervey, acting director of the Historic Environment Division (HED), said: ""We welcome the court's recognition that our heritage is an important and finite resource and an appreciation that once gone, these sites are impossible to replace. ""Not only did Moneybroom lime kilns, which date back to the 1800s, provide a unique example of a time when our society was undergoing massive change, they were a reminder of many aspects of our shared heritage, including the industrialisation of our landscape and society."" He added: ""HED appreciates the pressures that scheduled monument owners can face and one of our primary aims is to support them and facilitate their needs, where possible."" But he said the department will ""work with criminal justice partners to pursue prosecutions where warranted, in particular when historic monuments have been damaged or destroyed"".","['Listed buildings', 'Lisburn', 'Architecture']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C61D/production/_132271705_moneybroom_ant_063-500-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/54D5/production/_132271712_moneybroom_ant_063-500.jpg']",,UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67932289,Post Office scandal: 'They did everything to stop justice',A former sub-postmaster who had a fraud conviction quashed as part of the Post Office scandal has said something needs to be done to help those waiting for vindication.,2024-01-10,"A former sub-postmaster who had a fraud conviction quashed as part of the Post Office scandal has said something needs to be done to help those waiting for vindication. More than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted based on data from faulty Horizon software between 1999 and 2015. Some people went to prison for false accounting and theft, while others were financially ruined. Alan McLaughlin said that 20 years of his life was taken from him. In 2022, his conviction for fraud-related offences was overturned by the Court of Appeal. While the scandal has been public knowledge for some time, an ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which aired last week, catapulted the issue back into the spotlight. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the government would bring in a new law to ""swiftly"" exonerate and compensate victims. He was addressing the scandal in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. The law will not automatically apply in Northern Ireland or Scotland, but Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake said that Downing Street was ""keen"" to extend the provisions. The courts system in Northern Ireland is different from England and Wales. A public inquiry into the scandal began in February 2021 and will resume again on Thursday after breaking for Christmas. Mr McLaughlin said the Post Office stopped at nothing to cover up the scandal. ""People haven't realised the extent to which the Post Office has continued to use their powers, all the resources of a publicly-owned corporation, all for the purpose of stymieing the process of appeals and the process of compensation. ""They have done everything in their power to stop this."" he added. Mr McLaughlin said he lost decades of his life and the scandal has damaged many lives. ""There's 20 years of my life, which didn't turn out the way that I had planned them to,"" he added. ""There are several thousand people in the same position, who had livelihoods damaged, reputations damaged, health damaged. ""So it's been it's been quite a range of of things which were inflicted upon people by a publicly-owned body."" He said that, even with vindication, that does not take away from what he lost. Deirdre Connolly, from County Tyrone, was one of a number of people from Northern Ireland who were wrongly accused. She lost her job at Killeter Post Office in 2010 and had to borrow money from her family to pay more than £15,500 to the Post Office. She feels the prime minister did not go far enough. ""I didn't hear an apology, it lasted only 30 seconds, there are no details. I don't have much faith at the moment,"" she said. ""I thought the convictions could have been overturned in one swoop today. That would have been the best thing"". Speaking after Mr Sunak spoke in parliament, Fiona Elliott, a former sub-postmistress from County Tyrone said she was ""happy"". ""They are realising what has went wrong and admitting responsibility for everything. ""I am glad now that everybody know all these people were all innocent at the end of the day."" She told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today that the whole ordeal was still raw and difficult to process. Ms Elliott said that she and her husband bought the Post Office and shop in the rural village of Clady, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland in 2005. She hoped it would help provide financial security for her family in the future. ""Every week we were getting a lot discrepancies and shortfalls in the system,"" Ms Elliott told the programme. ""I kept putting the money in from the shop to the Post Office to keep it right but we never had a plus, it was always minus, the money was just disappearing in front of us."" Ms Elliott said she had contacted the Post Office a number of times and requested that they carry out an audit. When they did this, they discovered a £6,000 shortfall, which she then had to pay straight away. Ms Elliott was then suspended for a number of weeks before the Post Office later confirmed there would be no further action. She was offered redundancy at a time when rural post offices were closing, and resigned in 2008. Speaking to the inquiry back in May 2022, Ms Elliot recalled looking through bins at night time in a bid to account for money lost through the faulty IT system. Ms Elliott said she watched the ITV programme and said it was incredibly powerful, but also made her feel angry and annoyed that ""so many people have suffered and lives have been destroyed"". ""There were so many people involved, thousands and many more people may come forward after the programme."" The former sub-postmistress said she wants anyone responsible for the scandal brought before the courts to answer for it. She said she had not been able to make peace with her own experience yet and believes holding people accountable will help her find closure.",['Post Office Inquiry'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/254A/production/_132264590_alanmclaughlin.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/150F7/production/_104636268_fiona.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2907/production/_132230501_gettyimages-1916826347.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D9D8/production/_132186755_mr_bates_vs_the_post_office_02.jpg']",,UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67927963,Sunningdale: Former power-sharing minister 'saddened' by collapse,The only surviving member of Northern Ireland's first power-sharing executive has said its collapse 50 years ago is still a source of deep sadness to him.,2024-01-10,"The only surviving member of Northern Ireland's first power-sharing executive has said its collapse 50 years ago is still a source of deep sadness to him. Leslie Morrell was agriculture minister in the administration, which was set up in January 1974. It brought unionists and nationalists together in power at Stormont for the first time. Mr Morrell believes the executive might still exist if the government had handled security differently. The cross-party administration, formed after the Sunningdale Agreement in December 1973, was led by Ulster Unionist leader Brian Faulkner and had 11 ministers in total, including John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, it lasted only five months. It collapsed in the face of opposition from unionists and loyalists who formed the Ulster Workers' Council (UWC) and called a general strike. The IRA also opposed the Sunningdale agreement and continued its campaign of violence. Mr Morrell, who was deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said it was a missed opportunity. ""I've a great deal of sadness,"" he told BBC News NI. ""The fall of the executive precipitated 25 years of bloodshed, murder, destruction."" He pointed out that 50 years on, there was still no political stability in Northern Ireland. ""The same principles which led to us setting up the executive are still important. If parties are to work together, they need to agree,"" he said. ""They cannot be forced into agreement by some bit of law. They have to have a personal sort of agreement. It took us weeks to achieve that and achieve a respect between the members of the parties."" Back in 1974, there were six unionists on the executive - Mr Faulkner, Mr Morrell, Basil McIvor, Roy Bradford, Herbert Kirk and John Baxter. Representing the SDLP were leader Gerry Fitt, Mr Hume, Paddy Devlin and Austin Currie. The sole Alliance Party minister was their leader Oliver Napier. ""It was a very definite change,"" said Mr Morrell. ""Among the people who were sitting around that table were people who were regarded by some of the Protestant population as being enemies of the state."" He said ministers were able to concentrate on health, education, agriculture and the economy because constitutional issues had been dealt with the previous year. ""We were making it work - that is why we had to be stopped,"" he said. According to Mr Morrell, the loyalist workers who blocked roads did not have the support of the majority of unionists and should have been subjected to more robust action. ""What it required was action to clear the roads,"" he said. If that had happened, he believes ""the executive or its successors would still be there"". Mr Faulkner and the other unionist ministers resigned in May 1974, bringing an end to the power-sharing experiment. It was a violent period of time, with loyalist paramilitaries and the IRA both armed and active - Mr Morrell carried a gun for his own protection. He was one of seven representatives from the Londonderry constituency, where John Hume topped the poll in the June 1973 ssembly election. Although it was five decades ago, Mr Morrell remembers the 1974 executive well. He recalls being worried about his lack of ministerial experience, even though, as a farmer, he was comfortable with the agriculture brief. Before his first time answering questions in the Stormont Assembly, he remembers the advice Brian Faulkner gave him: ""If the questioner is a member of your own party, you give them an answer and satisfy them. ""If it's a member of another party, you tell them as little as possible."" At the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland, staff produced original files to BBC News NI from the 1974 executive plus official photographs taken of ministers, including Mr Morrell. Looking at the pictures, he recalled the intensive negotiations at Stormont Castle in 1973 that led to the power-sharing executive, and a comment which he will never forget. ""Basil McIvor said going up the steps (to Stormont Castle): 'This will be the political end of some of us',"" he said. ""He was right. But we had to try it.""","['Northern Ireland Assembly', 'Belfast', 'The Troubles', 'UK devolution']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5B82/production/_132262432_img_6125.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/145E2/production/_132262438_img_6185.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/103DE/production/_132262566_img_6109.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A9A2/production/_132262434_img_6177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/79A0/production/_132263113_img_6097.jpg']","['By Mark Simpson', 'BBC News NI community correspondent']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67928491,Sunak says Strikes in NI could be avoided by Stormont return,"The prime minister has said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored.",2024-01-10,"The prime minister has said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored. Rishi Sunak was speaking after Unite confirmed it would join 14 other unions across the public sector in a major strike on 18 January. Unite's deputy regional secretary David Thompson said frustration and anger had built up among unions. Unions have billed it as the biggest strike in the history of NI. Mr Sunak said ""significant progress"" has been made in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and there was ""now a very good basis"" to revive the power-sharing institutions. He was speaking in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. Northern Ireland's devolved government collapsed in February 2022 after the DUP withdrew in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The party has been seeking further legal assurances from Westminster of Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market. In December, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Stormont if an executive is restored. Mr Sunak said with the government's financial offer for Northern Ireland, there was ""a real chance to restore the executive, resolve pay for public sector workers rapidly, and get Northern Ireland and its public services moving again"". The DUP did not decide to end its boycott despite the government's offer in December. Teachers, nurses, health workers and civil servants will join transport workers in the ""generalised day of action"". Unite said 8,000 of its members would take part in the industrial action as part of an ongoing pay dispute, including 2,300 Translink staff. Mr Thompson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he acknowledged the action would affect the public. ""I would ask this question: is the impact on the public next Thursday greater than the decades of under-investment in our public services? I would suggest no,"" he said. ""The under-investment has created havoc in our public services across Northern Ireland and has impacted everybody within Northern Ireland. ""We now have a secretary of state who has made it clear just before Christmas that he has the money, he's just not willing to pay it. ""It seems he's using people as a bargaining chip in a game of politics which is absolutely wrong."" GMB and Siptu members at Translink will also take part in the strike. Translink workers from all three unions held four days of strike action in December, leading to major disruption to bus and train services. The general secretary of Unite, Sharon Graham, said: ""Unite will not allow the livelihoods of workers and the funding of public services to be used as a bargaining chip by this government."" Public transport workers joining strike action next Thursday is not unexpected. Unions had warned last month of further disruption in January in their ongoing dispute over pay. Four days of strike action by Translink workers across three weekends in December had a huge impact on retail and hospitality because it was the busiest time of year for Christmas shoppers and partygoers It led to cancellations and lost sales that business owners told us they were unlikely to get back. A Thursday in January, however, won't have the same impact on those sectors as it's a quieter time for both. It is more likely to affect workers who rely on public transport for their commute, or children going to school. That's not to say next Thursday won't be as disruptive - the scale alone with tens of thousands of public sector workers out on picket lines means it absolutely will be. But the sharp end of the disruption is likely to be felt in schools and hospitals, rather than by private sector businesses as was the case in December. It's difficult to assess the economic impact of public sector strikes here because we don't gather data in the same way as Great Britain. However, Dr Esmond Birnie at Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre who has taken a look at how the picture here compares suggests NI in recent months has been much more strike prone than GB and that next week's action will only consolidate that position. The pay issue has led to a series of strikes by healthcare staff, civil servants, teachers and other workers. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state and the government had no authority to negotiate public sector pay in Northern Ireland. ""It is for the relevant NI departments to negotiate pay policies,"" the spokesperson said. ""The secretary of state has expressed his disappointment that a new executive was not up and running to take the offer on the table and deliver it for the people of Northern Ireland before Christmas. ""It is now for the NI parties to come together, restore the Executive and begin to address the challenges facing the people of Northern Ireland, including public sector pay."" A total of 15 unions have announced they will be taking action on 18 January: These unions represent about 173,000 workers, although not all will be on strike.","['Strike action', 'Unite']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/556D/production/_130096812_unitepicketenniskillen.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1354C/production/_114008197_clodaghrice_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12433/production/_131230847_healthworkersandunionmembersrallyatcityhall007.jpg']","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,N.

She also refused to say whether the party would help Gerry Kelly pay costs from his failed libel case against writer Malachi O'Doherty. Mr Kelly sued over interviews in which it was said he had shot a prison officer during an escape in 1983. Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to decide whether to take a case. ""It's not about Sinn Féin supporting these cases,"" she added. ""It's about individuals defending their own names."" When asked whether Sinn Féin would contribute to Mr Kelly's legal costs, Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to defend their own cases. When asked again, she said her previous response had answered the question. DUP assembly member David Brooks has called on Sinn Féin to answer ""categorically"" if it will be making any contribution towards the cost of the libel case brought by Mr Kelly. ""The truth will emerge which it becomes clear who is picking up the tab for Gerry Kelly's case as he will have his own legal costs as well as those of Dr O'Doherty,"" he added. The High Court in Belfast struck out Mr Kelly's case, describing it as ""scandalous, frivolous and vexatious"". The ruling went on to characterise Mr Kelly's case as what is known as a Slapp action - Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. It stated that on balance, the proceedings ""were initiated not for the genuine purposes of vindicating a reputation injured by defamatory statements, but rather for the purpose of stifling the voices of Mr Kelly's troublesome critics"". The case was one of a number of recent libel actions taken by Sinn Féin representatives against journalists and political opponents. Ms O'Neill herself took a case against a DUP councillor last year, but was awarded no damages as the judge said the comments were misogynistic but not defamatory. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said that ""everybody's entitled to defend their good name"". ""And if you feel if you've been defamed at any time then you are entitled as the law says to take a case, and I commend that to anybody who feels that's where they need to be,"" she said. ""I'm the Sinn Féin vice-president, I'm a senior member of the party, and I can assure you there is no joined-up, concerted effort to silence anybody - but I do defend anybody's right to defend their own name."" Mr Kelly, an assembly member for north Belfast, said the ruling, published on Monday, was a ""substantive judgement,"" which he would study with his lawyer. He was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze prison near Lisburn. During the break-out, prison officer John Adams was shot in the head. Mr Kelly has never admitted shooting him and was found not guilty at a trial in 1987. Mr Kelly had claimed Dr O'Doherty's comments, made in 2019, had gravely damaged his reputation and brought his standing as an assembly member into disrepute. However, Dr O'Doherty pointed out that the prison officer had claimed Mr Kelly fired the shot. He also argued there was no damage to Mr Kelly's reputation, as he had served prison sentences for the 1973 Old Bailey bombings and he is someone publicly identified as a former IRA member.

Kevin Conway was killed in Rossnareen Park in the Greenan area of west Belfast on Tuesday night. The 26-year-old was on bail after being charged with the January 2023 murder of Mr Whitla, a shooting linked to an organised crime gang known as the Firm. During court hearings in 2023 it was said Mr Conway was under threat. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said paramedics were called just before 21:30 GMT on Tuesday, but Mr Conway died at the scene. Police remain in Rossnareen Park, where cordons are in place. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Det Insp Gina Quinn said it was a ""horrific, calculated and ruthless murder carried out in a busy residential area"". Det Insp Quinn said Mr Conway was shot ""multiple times"" and pronounced dead at the scene. ""Such cold-blooded brutality has absolutely no place in our society,"" she said. ""This isn't about what Kevin may or may not have been linked to, this is about trying to find his killers. Any incidents linked to Kevin form part of the ongoing police investigation and will be looked at as a line of enquiry."" There will be an increased police presence in the area in the coming days, Belfast West MP, Sinn Féin's Paul Maskey, described Tuesday's shooting as a brutal killing. ""There is no place for guns on our streets,"" he said. Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor Paul Doherty said the incident had sent shockwaves through the community. ""Following on from previous incidents in the area in recent days local people are seriously concerned at this outbreak of criminality as we begin the new year,"" he added. People Before Profit assembly member Gerry Carroll also condemned the killing. ""There can be no justification for gunning someone down in their home in cold blood,"" he said, ""All right-thinking people will be abhorred by this shooting."" There are about 60 organised crime gangs operating in Northern Ireland, according to a report published last year based on police assessments. The Firm is one of the most talked about. It has been implicated in two previous murders - Malcolm McKeown in Warringstown in 2019 and Shane Whitla in Lurgan. Both were shot dead. The gang largely operates out of Lurgan and Portadown in County Armagh. It is heavily involved in drugs dealing and is made up of criminals who have loyalist and republican backgrounds.",['Belfast'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14556/production/_132268238_belfastforensic.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1367E/production/_132268497_pacemaker10-01-24murderinvestigationlaunchedinwestbelfast001.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/61F4/production/_132267052_5de4eecb-550b-4ade-973e-0b62022b633a_upload.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png']","[""By Julian O'Neill"", 'BBC News NI crime and justice correspondent']",UK,N.

She also refused to say whether the party would help Gerry Kelly pay costs from his failed libel case against writer Malachi O'Doherty. Mr Kelly sued over interviews in which it was said he had shot a prison officer during an escape in 1983. Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to decide whether to take a case. ""It's not about Sinn Féin supporting these cases,"" she added. ""It's about individuals defending their own names."" When asked whether Sinn Féin would contribute to Mr Kelly's legal costs, Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to defend their own cases. When asked again, she said her previous response had answered the question. DUP assembly member David Brooks has called on Sinn Féin to answer ""categorically"" if it will be making any contribution towards the cost of the libel case brought by Mr Kelly. ""The truth will emerge which it becomes clear who is picking up the tab for Gerry Kelly's case as he will have his own legal costs as well as those of Dr O'Doherty,"" he added. The High Court in Belfast struck out Mr Kelly's case, describing it as ""scandalous, frivolous and vexatious"". The ruling went on to characterise Mr Kelly's case as what is known as a Slapp action - Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. It stated that on balance, the proceedings ""were initiated not for the genuine purposes of vindicating a reputation injured by defamatory statements, but rather for the purpose of stifling the voices of Mr Kelly's troublesome critics"". The case was one of a number of recent libel actions taken by Sinn Féin representatives against journalists and political opponents. Ms O'Neill herself took a case against a DUP councillor last year, but was awarded no damages as the judge said the comments were misogynistic but not defamatory. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said that ""everybody's entitled to defend their good name"". ""And if you feel if you've been defamed at any time then you are entitled as the law says to take a case, and I commend that to anybody who feels that's where they need to be,"" she said. ""I'm the Sinn Féin vice-president, I'm a senior member of the party, and I can assure you there is no joined-up, concerted effort to silence anybody - but I do defend anybody's right to defend their own name."" Mr Kelly, an assembly member for north Belfast, said the ruling, published on Monday, was a ""substantive judgement,"" which he would study with his lawyer. He was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze prison near Lisburn. During the break-out, prison officer John Adams was shot in the head. Mr Kelly has never admitted shooting him and was found not guilty at a trial in 1987. Mr Kelly had claimed Dr O'Doherty's comments, made in 2019, had gravely damaged his reputation and brought his standing as an assembly member into disrepute. However, Dr O'Doherty pointed out that the prison officer had claimed Mr Kelly fired the shot. He also argued there was no damage to Mr Kelly's reputation, as he had served prison sentences for the 1973 Old Bailey bombings and he is someone publicly identified as a former IRA member.

More than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted based on data from faulty Horizon software between 1999 and 2015. Some people went to prison for false accounting and theft, while others were financially ruined. Alan McLaughlin said that 20 years of his life was taken from him. In 2022, his conviction for fraud-related offences was overturned by the Court of Appeal. While the scandal has been public knowledge for some time, an ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which aired last week, catapulted the issue back into the spotlight. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the government would bring in a new law to ""swiftly"" exonerate and compensate victims. He was addressing the scandal in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. The law will not automatically apply in Northern Ireland or Scotland, but Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake said that Downing Street was ""keen"" to extend the provisions. The courts system in Northern Ireland is different from England and Wales. A public inquiry into the scandal began in February 2021 and will resume again on Thursday after breaking for Christmas. Mr McLaughlin said the Post Office stopped at nothing to cover up the scandal.

Rishi Sunak was speaking after Unite confirmed it would join 14 other unions across the public sector in a major strike on 18 January. Unite's deputy regional secretary David Thompson said frustration and anger had built up among unions. Unions have billed it as the biggest strike in the history of NI. Mr Sunak said ""significant progress"" has been made in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and there was ""now a very good basis"" to revive the power-sharing institutions. He was speaking in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. Northern Ireland's devolved government collapsed in February 2022 after the DUP withdrew in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The party has been seeking further legal assurances from Westminster of Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market. In December, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Stormont if an executive is restored. Mr Sunak said with the government's financial offer for Northern Ireland, there was ""a real chance to restore the executive, resolve pay for public sector workers rapidly, and get Northern Ireland and its public services moving again"". The DUP did not decide to end its boycott despite the government's offer in December. Teachers, nurses, health workers and civil servants will join transport workers in the ""generalised day of action"". Unite said 8,000 of its members would take part in the industrial action as part of an ongoing pay dispute, including 2,300 Translink staff. Mr Thompson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he acknowledged the action would affect the public. ""I would ask this question: is the impact on the public next Thursday greater than the decades of under-investment in our public services? I would suggest no,"" he said. ""The under-investment has created havoc in our public services across Northern Ireland and has impacted everybody within Northern Ireland. ""We now have a secretary of state who has made it clear just before Christmas that he has the money, he's just not willing to pay it. ""It seems he's using people as a bargaining chip in a game of politics which is absolutely wrong."" GMB and Siptu members at Translink will also take part in the strike. Translink workers from all three unions held four days of strike action in December, leading to major disruption to bus and train services. The general secretary of Unite, Sharon Graham, said: ""Unite will not allow the livelihoods of workers and the funding of public services to be used as a bargaining chip by this government."" Public transport workers joining strike action next Thursday is not unexpected. Unions had warned last month of further disruption in January in their ongoing dispute over pay. Four days of strike action by Translink workers across three weekends in December had a huge impact on retail and hospitality because it was the busiest time of year for Christmas shoppers and partygoers It led to cancellations and lost sales that business owners told us they were unlikely to get back. A Thursday in January, however, won't have the same impact on those sectors as it's a quieter time for both. It is more likely to affect workers who rely on public transport for their commute, or children going to school. That's not to say next Thursday won't be as disruptive - the scale alone with tens of thousands of public sector workers out on picket lines means it absolutely will be. But the sharp end of the disruption is likely to be felt in schools and hospitals, rather than by private sector businesses as was the case in December. It's difficult to assess the economic impact of public sector strikes here because we don't gather data in the same way as Great Britain. However, Dr Esmond Birnie at Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre who has taken a look at how the picture here compares suggests NI in recent months has been much more strike prone than GB and that next week's action will only consolidate that position. The pay issue has led to a series of strikes by healthcare staff, civil servants, teachers and other workers. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state and the government had no authority to negotiate public sector pay in Northern Ireland. ""It is for the relevant NI departments to negotiate pay policies,"" the spokesperson said. ""The secretary of state has expressed his disappointment that a new executive was not up and running to take the offer on the table and deliver it for the people of Northern Ireland before Christmas. ""It is now for the NI parties to come together, restore the Executive and begin to address the challenges facing the people of Northern Ireland, including public sector pay."" A total of 15 unions have announced they will be taking action on 18 January: These unions represent about 173,000 workers, although not all will be on strike.","['Strike action', 'Unite']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/556D/production/_130096812_unitepicketenniskillen.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1354C/production/_114008197_clodaghrice_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12433/production/_131230847_healthworkersandunionmembersrallyatcityhall007.jpg']","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67938183,Monuments in Northern Ireland: Man fined £50k for demolishing kilns,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim.",2024-01-10,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim. Henry James Price, from Glenavy Road, Lisburn, recently pleaded guilty to destroying a set of 19th Century lime kilns on land he owned in Moneybroom. The judge said it was the first prosecution of its kind in Northern Ireland. Fining Price, he said saying there must be a deterrent to dissuade others. The judge at Craigavon Crown Court added that the defendant's culpability was high given he knew the kilns were protected yet he still chose to cause ""irreparable damage"" to them. During the case, the court was told that 64-year-old Price is both a farmer and a director of a successful house building firm, JH Price and Sons Ltd. He bought the site on Moneybroom Road for £270,000 in June 2019.  It is close to his home and he was already in possession of some adjoining land. In August 2020, Price lodged an application with the council to secure the site and potentially develop a small portion of it, but the project was hit by delays. His site contained a large, protected structure known as the Moneybroom lime kilns. There were a number of limestone quarries in the Lisburn area and during the Victorian era kilns were built to produce lime for the agriculture and construction industries. The court heard that a chartered architect estimated it would have cost about £630,000 to restore the kilns to their original condition. Because they were protected monuments, a grant of up to £50,000 would have been available towards the restoration, but that still left Price facing a substantial bill. On 16 April 2021, police were called to the site following a report of building works taking place where protected monuments were situated. Officers discovered the kilns had been demolished and when they interviewed Price in September that year, he admitted he had ordered his employees to clear them. He apologised for destroying the kilns at that time, but told police he believed they were ""structurally dangerous"". Price also claimed to police there had been significant antisocial behaviour at the site, particularly at night and ""he was afraid of someone getting killed"". The Moneybroom kilns were most likely constructed between 1870 and 1900, according to an estimate by the Historic Environment Division (HED), an agency within Stormont's Department of Communities. The judge said these were the only kilns of their type in Northern Ireland and were ""an almost unique example of this type of industrial architecture"". In a mitigation plea, a defence barrister said Price ""accepts without reservation that he made a grave error and that the demolition of the lime kilns should never have taken place"". But he added that ""the integrity of the kilns was not jealously guarded by the department over the years"", pointing out there had been a lack of investment and no departmental plan to restore them. The barrister said his client had spent about £50,000 to secure the site and replant trees. He added Price had also lost his single farm payment and ""by virtue of his conduct it is now simply not possible for the defendant to develop the site in any way that would generate any profit - he has closed that particular avenue off for good"". The judge acknowledged that the kilns were not visible from the road, were not a money-generating tourist attraction and that their value was subjective. He also conceded that with no plan to repair them, they would eventually have fallen apart by themselves. Nevertheless, he said there had to be a deterrent to dissuade others who ""may be tempted to play fast and loose"" with legislation protecting other historical monuments. Giving Price credit for his guilty pleas and clear record, the judge told the defendant that if had he not admitted the offence, the fine would have been £75,000. Price was allowed six months to pay. In a statement, Brian McKervey, acting director of the Historic Environment Division (HED), said: ""We welcome the court's recognition that our heritage is an important and finite resource and an appreciation that once gone, these sites are impossible to replace. ""Not only did Moneybroom lime kilns, which date back to the 1800s, provide a unique example of a time when our society was undergoing massive change, they were a reminder of many aspects of our shared heritage, including the industrialisation of our landscape and society."" He added: ""HED appreciates the pressures that scheduled monument owners can face and one of our primary aims is to support them and facilitate their needs, where possible.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67928491,Sunak says Strikes in NI could be avoided by Stormont return,"The prime minister has said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored.",2024-01-10,"The prime minister has said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored. Rishi Sunak was speaking after Unite confirmed it would join 14 other unions across the public sector in a major strike on 18 January. Unite's deputy regional secretary David Thompson said frustration and anger had built up among unions. Unions have billed it as the biggest strike in the history of NI. Mr Sunak said ""significant progress"" has been made in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and there was ""now a very good basis"" to revive the power-sharing institutions. He was speaking in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. Northern Ireland's devolved government collapsed in February 2022 after the DUP withdrew in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The party has been seeking further legal assurances from Westminster of Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market. In December, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Stormont if an executive is restored. Mr Sunak said with the government's financial offer for Northern Ireland, there was ""a real chance to restore the executive, resolve pay for public sector workers rapidly, and get Northern Ireland and its public services moving again"". The DUP did not decide to end its boycott despite the government's offer in December. Teachers, nurses, health workers and civil servants will join transport workers in the ""generalised day of action"". Unite said 8,000 of its members would take part in the industrial action as part of an ongoing pay dispute, including 2,300 Translink staff. Mr Thompson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he acknowledged the action would affect the public. ""I would ask this question: is the impact on the public next Thursday greater than the decades of under-investment in our public services? I would suggest no,"" he said. ""The under-investment has created havoc in our public services across Northern Ireland and has impacted everybody within Northern Ireland. ""We now have a secretary of state who has made it clear just before Christmas that he has the money, he's just not willing to pay it. ""It seems he's using people as a bargaining chip in a game of politics which is absolutely wrong."" GMB and Siptu members at Translink will also take part in the strike. Translink workers from all three unions held four days of strike action in December, leading to major disruption to bus and train services. The general secretary of Unite, Sharon Graham, said: ""Unite will not allow the livelihoods of workers and the funding of public services to be used as a bargaining chip by this government."" Public transport workers joining strike action next Thursday is not unexpected. Unions had warned last month of further disruption in January in their ongoing dispute over pay. Four days of strike action by Translink workers across three weekends in December had a huge impact on retail and hospitality because it was the busiest time of year for Christmas shoppers and partygoers It led to cancellations and lost sales that business owners told us they were unlikely to get back. A Thursday in January, however, won't have the same impact on those sectors as it's a quieter time for both. It is more likely to affect workers who rely on public transport for their commute, or children going to school. That's not to say next Thursday won't be as disruptive - the scale alone with tens of thousands of public sector workers out on picket lines means it absolutely will be. But the sharp end of the disruption is likely to be felt in schools and hospitals, rather than by private sector businesses as was the case in December. It's difficult to assess the economic impact of public sector strikes here because we don't gather data in the same way as Great Britain. However, Dr Esmond Birnie at Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre who has taken a look at how the picture here compares suggests NI in recent months has been much more strike prone than GB and that next week's action will only consolidate that position. The pay issue has led to a series of strikes by healthcare staff, civil servants, teachers and other workers. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state and the government had no authority to negotiate public sector pay in Northern Ireland. ""It is for the relevant NI departments to negotiate pay policies,"" the spokesperson said. ""The secretary of state has expressed his disappointment that a new executive was not up and running to take the offer on the table and deliver it for the people of Northern Ireland before Christmas. ""It is now for the NI parties to come together, restore the Executive and begin to address the challenges facing the people of Northern Ireland, including public sector pay."" A total of 15 unions have announced they will be taking action on 18 January: These unions represent about 173,000 workers, although not all will be on strike.","['Strike action', 'Unite']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/556D/production/_130096812_unitepicketenniskillen.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1354C/production/_114008197_clodaghrice_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12433/production/_131230847_healthworkersandunionmembersrallyatcityhall007.jpg']","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,N.

Leslie Morrell was agriculture minister in the administration, which was set up in January 1974. It brought unionists and nationalists together in power at Stormont for the first time. Mr Morrell believes the executive might still exist if the government had handled security differently. The cross-party administration, formed after the Sunningdale Agreement in December 1973, was led by Ulster Unionist leader Brian Faulkner and had 11 ministers in total, including John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, it lasted only five months. It collapsed in the face of opposition from unionists and loyalists who formed the Ulster Workers' Council (UWC) and called a general strike. The IRA also opposed the Sunningdale agreement and continued its campaign of violence. Mr Morrell, who was deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said it was a missed opportunity. ""I've a great deal of sadness,"" he told BBC News NI. ""The fall of the executive precipitated 25 years of bloodshed, murder, destruction."" He pointed out that 50 years on, there was still no political stability in Northern Ireland. ""The same principles which led to us setting up the executive are still important. If parties are to work together, they need to agree,"" he said. ""They cannot be forced into agreement by some bit of law. They have to have a personal sort of agreement. It took us weeks to achieve that and achieve a respect between the members of the parties."" Back in 1974, there were six unionists on the executive - Mr Faulkner, Mr Morrell, Basil McIvor, Roy Bradford, Herbert Kirk and John Baxter. Representing the SDLP were leader Gerry Fitt, Mr Hume, Paddy Devlin and Austin Currie. The sole Alliance Party minister was their leader Oliver Napier. ""It was a very definite change,"" said Mr Morrell. ""Among the people who were sitting around that table were people who were regarded by some of the Protestant population as being enemies of the state."" He said ministers were able to concentrate on health, education, agriculture and the economy because constitutional issues had been dealt with the previous year. ""We were making it work - that is why we had to be stopped,"" he said. According to Mr Morrell, the loyalist workers who blocked roads did not have the support of the majority of unionists and should have been subjected to more robust action. ""What it required was action to clear the roads,"" he said. If that had happened, he believes ""the executive or its successors would still be there"". Mr Faulkner and the other unionist ministers resigned in May 1974, bringing an end to the power-sharing experiment. It was a violent period of time, with loyalist paramilitaries and the IRA both armed and active - Mr Morrell carried a gun for his own protection. He was one of seven representatives from the Londonderry constituency, where John Hume topped the poll in the June 1973 ssembly election. Although it was five decades ago, Mr Morrell remembers the 1974 executive well. He recalls being worried about his lack of ministerial experience, even though, as a farmer, he was comfortable with the agriculture brief. Before his first time answering questions in the Stormont Assembly, he remembers the advice Brian Faulkner gave him: ""If the questioner is a member of your own party, you give them an answer and satisfy them. ""If it's a member of another party, you tell them as little as possible."" At the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland, staff produced original files to BBC News NI from the 1974 executive plus official photographs taken of ministers, including Mr Morrell. Looking at the pictures, he recalled the intensive negotiations at Stormont Castle in 1973 that led to the power-sharing executive, and a comment which he will never forget.

She also refused to say whether the party would help Gerry Kelly pay costs from his failed libel case against writer Malachi O'Doherty. Mr Kelly sued over interviews in which it was said he had shot a prison officer during an escape in 1983. Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to decide whether to take a case. ""It's not about Sinn Féin supporting these cases,"" she added. ""It's about individuals defending their own names."" When asked whether Sinn Féin would contribute to Mr Kelly's legal costs, Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to defend their own cases. When asked again, she said her previous response had answered the question. DUP assembly member David Brooks has called on Sinn Féin to answer ""categorically"" if it will be making any contribution towards the cost of the libel case brought by Mr Kelly. ""The truth will emerge which it becomes clear who is picking up the tab for Gerry Kelly's case as he will have his own legal costs as well as those of Dr O'Doherty,"" he added. The High Court in Belfast struck out Mr Kelly's case, describing it as ""scandalous, frivolous and vexatious"". The ruling went on to characterise Mr Kelly's case as what is known as a Slapp action - Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. It stated that on balance, the proceedings ""were initiated not for the genuine purposes of vindicating a reputation injured by defamatory statements, but rather for the purpose of stifling the voices of Mr Kelly's troublesome critics"". The case was one of a number of recent libel actions taken by Sinn Féin representatives against journalists and political opponents. Ms O'Neill herself took a case against a DUP councillor last year, but was awarded no damages as the judge said the comments were misogynistic but not defamatory. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said that ""everybody's entitled to defend their good name"". ""And if you feel if you've been defamed at any time then you are entitled as the law says to take a case, and I commend that to anybody who feels that's where they need to be,"" she said. ""I'm the Sinn Féin vice-president, I'm a senior member of the party, and I can assure you there is no joined-up, concerted effort to silence anybody - but I do defend anybody's right to defend their own name."" Mr Kelly, an assembly member for north Belfast, said the ruling, published on Monday, was a ""substantive judgement,"" which he would study with his lawyer. He was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze prison near Lisburn. During the break-out, prison officer John Adams was shot in the head. Mr Kelly has never admitted shooting him and was found not guilty at a trial in 1987. Mr Kelly had claimed Dr O'Doherty's comments, made in 2019, had gravely damaged his reputation and brought his standing as an assembly member into disrepute. However, Dr O'Doherty pointed out that the prison officer had claimed Mr Kelly fired the shot. He also argued there was no damage to Mr Kelly's reputation, as he had served prison sentences for the 1973 Old Bailey bombings and he is someone publicly identified as a former IRA member. Mr Kelly has also written books which deal with the escape, although they conceal who fired the shot. In the ruling, Master Evan Bell stated: ""What Mr Kelly has written in his books, in my view, makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to rebut the argument that he was not a joint tortfeasor in respect of the battery. ""Even if one accepts Mr Kelly has not explicitly admitted pulling the trigger, the content of his books appears to make Mr Kelly civilly liable, on the balance of probabilities, for the shooting of Mr Adams. ""In the light of that, these defamation proceedings against Dr O'Doherty are completely untenable. ""For that reason the court strikes them out on the basis that they are scandalous, frivolous and vexatious.""","['Belfast', 'Sinn Féin', ""Michelle O'Neill""]","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18532/production/_131643699_gettyimages-1255673174-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F41/production/_132252858_gettyimages-488147039-1.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1D65/production/_132252570_malachio'doherty02.jpg""]","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67938183,Monuments in Northern Ireland: Man fined £50k for demolishing kilns,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim.",2024-01-10,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim. Henry James Price, from Glenavy Road, Lisburn, recently pleaded guilty to destroying a set of 19th Century lime kilns on land he owned in Moneybroom. The judge said it was the first prosecution of its kind in Northern Ireland. Fining Price, he said saying there must be a deterrent to dissuade others. The judge at Craigavon Crown Court added that the defendant's culpability was high given he knew the kilns were protected yet he still chose to cause ""irreparable damage"" to them. During the case, the court was told that 64-year-old Price is both a farmer and a director of a successful house building firm, JH Price and Sons Ltd. He bought the site on Moneybroom Road for £270,000 in June 2019.  It is close to his home and he was already in possession of some adjoining land. In August 2020, Price lodged an application with the council to secure the site and potentially develop a small portion of it, but the project was hit by delays. His site contained a large, protected structure known as the Moneybroom lime kilns. There were a number of limestone quarries in the Lisburn area and during the Victorian era kilns were built to produce lime for the agriculture and construction industries. The court heard that a chartered architect estimated it would have cost about £630,000 to restore the kilns to their original condition. Because they were protected monuments, a grant of up to £50,000 would have been available towards the restoration, but that still left Price facing a substantial bill. On 16 April 2021, police were called to the site following a report of building works taking place where protected monuments were situated. Officers discovered the kilns had been demolished and when they interviewed Price in September that year, he admitted he had ordered his employees to clear them. He apologised for destroying the kilns at that time, but told police he believed they were ""structurally dangerous"". Price also claimed to police there had been significant antisocial behaviour at the site, particularly at night and ""he was afraid of someone getting killed"". The Moneybroom kilns were most likely constructed between 1870 and 1900, according to an estimate by the Historic Environment Division (HED), an agency within Stormont's Department of Communities. The judge said these were the only kilns of their type in Northern Ireland and were ""an almost unique example of this type of industrial architecture"". In a mitigation plea, a defence barrister said Price ""accepts without reservation that he made a grave error and that the demolition of the lime kilns should never have taken place"". But he added that ""the integrity of the kilns was not jealously guarded by the department over the years"", pointing out there had been a lack of investment and no departmental plan to restore them. The barrister said his client had spent about £50,000 to secure the site and replant trees. He added Price had also lost his single farm payment and ""by virtue of his conduct it is now simply not possible for the defendant to develop the site in any way that would generate any profit - he has closed that particular avenue off for good"". The judge acknowledged that the kilns were not visible from the road, were not a money-generating tourist attraction and that their value was subjective. He also conceded that with no plan to repair them, they would eventually have fallen apart by themselves. Nevertheless, he said there had to be a deterrent to dissuade others who ""may be tempted to play fast and loose"" with legislation protecting other historical monuments. Giving Price credit for his guilty pleas and clear record, the judge told the defendant that if had he not admitted the offence, the fine would have been £75,000. Price was allowed six months to pay. In a statement, Brian McKervey, acting director of the Historic Environment Division (HED), said: ""We welcome the court's recognition that our heritage is an important and finite resource and an appreciation that once gone, these sites are impossible to replace. ""Not only did Moneybroom lime kilns, which date back to the 1800s, provide a unique example of a time when our society was undergoing massive change, they were a reminder of many aspects of our shared heritage, including the industrialisation of our landscape and society."" He added: ""HED appreciates the pressures that scheduled monument owners can face and one of our primary aims is to support them and facilitate their needs, where possible."" But he said the department will ""work with criminal justice partners to pursue prosecutions where warranted, in particular when historic monuments have been damaged or destroyed"".","['Listed buildings', 'Lisburn', 'Architecture']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C61D/production/_132271705_moneybroom_ant_063-500-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/54D5/production/_132271712_moneybroom_ant_063-500.jpg']",,UK,N.

Katrina Moore, principal of Malone Integrated College, said that to watch a child go hungry was heartbreaking. The secondary school in Finaghy has about 800 pupils, just over half of whom are entitled to free school meals. As a temporary measure to address hunger, Ms Moore is using grant money to provide free food to all her pupils. The principal told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme she was ""very conscious of those young people who I know are probably not going to get a hot meal at any time during the day whether it be breakfast dinner or an evening meal"". ""So for us to be able to provide a hot meal for these young people and their families, to improve their education chances, it's a no brainer,"" she added. In December 2022, Malone Integrated College used grants from the James Kane Foundation to provide breakfasts for hungry pupils on a temporary basis. The charity was set up by the late aerospace entrepreneur Jim Kane from Portadown, County Armagh, who bequeathed his fortune to ""advance education for the public benefit"" in Northern Ireland. Malone Integrated College recently went back to the charity for more help, and currently the school is offering free meals to every pupil until the mid-term break in February. But beyond that date, the college does not have the funds to continue the service. ""I don't know what's going to happen"", Ms Moore said. ""I just don't want any child to go hungry, it's just not fair, it's not right. ""I'm going to make a point of going out and badgering and harassing people as only I can to try and get this to increase to keep it going into the future."" Ms Moore joins a growing list of headteachers who have spoken out about how school budgets are disadvantaging pupils from low income households. Last month, the principal of Brownlow Integrated College in Craigavon, County Armagh told BBC News NI a pupil had fainted due to hunger and families were ""struggling to afford the basics"". Northern Ireland is also the only part of the UK where there is no support available to feed schoolchildren during the school holidays. In March 2023, the school holiday food grant was scrapped by the Department of Education. The fortnightly payment of £27 per child was to help the families of nearly 100,000 pupils entitled to free school meals during term time. At the time the department said it was ending the scheme ""with great reluctance"" but no longer had enough money to fund it.","['School meals', 'Belfast', 'Finaghy', 'NI education']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/129E/production/_132266740_whatsappimage2024-01-10at09.25.50-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2036/production/_132264280_gettyimages-538487028.jpg']",,UK,N.

Northern Ireland has a legally-binding target of generating 80% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2030. A statement said ""due cognisance"" had been given to ""the contribution that renewable energy can make to both the economy and tackling climate change"". But it added that the ""economic and environmental benefits"" had been outweighed by ""the significant harm that would be caused to the landscape"" and the ""ecological impacts"" on protected species"". RES had said the wind farm would be capable of generating enough power to supply 70,000 homes, as well as creating £24.7m in jobs and investment. Jennifer McCorry, the firm's senior development project manager, said it was extremely disappointed by the decision. She said that for Northern Ireland the project would help Northern Ireland to meet renewable energy targets and create up to £5m worth of wages in the 12-month construction period. The decision on the notice of opinion to refuse was taken by the department's permanent secretary under powers laid out in the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act 2022. It is legislation that allows officials to make certain decisions in the absence of ministers. The decision may be appealed up to six weeks after being made. It came as the NI Chamber of Commerce published proposals for the reform of the planning system. Its ideas include legal and regulatory changes alongside improving existing processes. It suggests that statutory consultees, which includes public bodies like NI Water, should face strict deadlines, after which it could be assumed they consent to a planning application. Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of NI Chamber, said: ""A well-performing planning function is key to instilling confidence in the market for potential investors and to enable the development of the required infrastructure, when it comes to connectivity, services, energy and reducing our carbon emissions.""","['Wind farms', 'NI economy', 'Wind power', 'Wind turbines', 'Renewable energy']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A858/production/_132269034_gettyimages-535137064.jpg'],"['By Louise Cullen', 'BBC NI agriculture and environment correspondent']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67916306,Late barn owl brood in County Down causes surprise and shock,"A barn owl pair, considered to be one of Northern Ireland's most threatened farmland birds, have welcomed an ""extremely late"" winter brood.",2024-01-10,"A barn owl pair, considered to be one of Northern Ireland's most threatened farmland birds, have welcomed an ""extremely late"" winter brood. Four chicks were discovered at a nest in Ballycruttle Farm near Downpatrick, County Down in November. Conservation charity Ulster Wildlife said the brood was one of the latest recorded in Northern Ireland. Barn owl eggs are usually laid in April, with fledging beginning in June or July depending on the weather. However, the latest brood fledged - that is, learned to fly - in December, causing shock amongst conservationists. The barn owl is one of Northern Ireland's rarest birds and is red-listed on the Irish Birds of Conservation Concern and protected under the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985. There are fewer than 30 breeding pairs estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, which has made the discovery all the more exciting. Katy Bell, a senior conservation officer at Ulster Wildlife, said she ""couldn't believe"" it when she was sent an audio recording of the chicks snoring and rasping. ""A visit confirmed the exciting news, but our main concern was whether the chicks would survive given the extremely wet weather and floods,"" she said. Despite the fact barn owls struggle to hunt in wet conditions, Ms Bell added, the odds were in their favour as small mammals fleeing providing easy prey. The team returned a few weeks later and were ""ecstatic"" to bring in the four healthy chicks. ""This is the second consecutive year barn owls have bred at Ballycruttle Farm - a real testament to their wildlife-rich habitats and practices,"" Ms Bell added. However, the story behind the Ballycruttle brood is not too dissimilar to a typical soap opera plot. Last March, a clattering of jackdaws forced the female from her nest box to a nearby farm, managed by the Kelly family. The female and a nearby male, who had been hunting on the Kelly farm for many years, then bred and the pair had one chick late last summer. However, back in Ballycruttle, the male barn owl kept calling for the female to return. She eventually conceded, leaving the chick in the hands of the male who continued to feed it. With the pair reunited back in their original nest box, she then lay another clutch of eggs. Dawn Stocking of Ballycruttle Farm said the ""nail-biting"" story kept them on their toes. ""I was, of course, disappointed when the female jumped ship to my neighbour's fantastic farm and thought that we weren't going to see any chicks at Ballycruttle this year at all,"" she said. ""So, you can imagine my utter excitement when I heard babies snoring from the nest box - it was like Christmas had come early!"" Wildlife cameras were installed to catch the brood's antics, catching everything from wing stretches, small hops and even the chicks' first flights. ""It has been absolutely magical,"" Ms Stocking added. Both Ballycruttle Farm and Kelly's Farm are part of a project in County Down to halt and reserve the decline of barn owls led by RSPB NI. Michelle Duggan from the charity said it was a delight to see the work carried out by the nature-friendly farms yield positive results. ""The valuable seed-rich habitats maintained on both farms are an essential winter food source for the endangered yellowhammer, and also ideal hunting territory for barn owls to catch small mammal prey,"" she said. ""Healthy hedgerows combined with areas of rough grassland allow barn owls to expand their hunting territory even further."" The chicks have also been rigged to help identify and keep track of the birds' movement.","['RSPB', 'Wildlife', 'Owls', 'Conservation']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/90B5/production/_132254073_barnowlchickbeingweighed.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/105E5/production/_132254076_katybellulsterwildlifedawnstockingballycruttlefarm-michelledugganrspbni.jpg']",,UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67928490,Buy Nothing New- can the campaign work?,"Buy Nothing New Month - it sounds straightforward, doesn't it?",2024-01-10,"Buy Nothing New Month - it sounds straightforward, doesn't it? The campaign asks for you to think about your choices as a consumer - do you actually need to buy new, or can you reuse, repair or repurpose something you already own? It began in Great Britain in January 2023 and a quick internet search doesn't reveal any backlash there. But when it launched for the first time here in January 2024, retailers got angry. A social post promoting the scheme in the Ards and North Down Borough Council area recently caught the ire of local business owners who felt it didn't help their prospects in what is traditionally a tough month. That's perhaps not that surprising, given they've battled with the cost-of-living crisis - which is also a cost-of-doing-business crisis - for more than a year and endured a December disrupted by transport strikes. But changing consumer choices is part of the road to addressing our carbon emissions and waste. Northern Ireland generated almost 230,000 tonnes of household waste in the first three months of 2023. That total includes items for recycling and for landfill, and is equivalent to more than 14,000 double decker buses. If we reduce what we use, less demand will be created for the materials that go into those products, fewer things are likely to contribute to landfill or recycling and less stress will be placed on the planet. But that's where the phrase ""just transition"" comes in - it refers to the need for nobody to be disadvantaged or left behind in the move towards greener, more planet-friendly living. If we suddenly and sharply change our consumption of products, that could jeopardise jobs, threaten the economy and make it harder to sustain a transition to lower-emission lifestyles. But we are already off-track on our net zero aims - so if we don't change our habits, we jeopardise the planet we live on. It's a delicate balancing act - and one with different views, on all sides. BBC News NI spoke to three people - a campaigner, the head of a retail organisation and an upcycler - about their views on how to strike the right balance. Chris Gourley, the waste and pollution solutions strategic lead at Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, leads the campaign here and said it could lend itself to support local and small businesses. He said overconsumption was a real problem and the solution was to move away from ""make, take and dispose"". For him, the answer to a circular model: make, take, remake, repair. And he hopes, over time, this will lead to people wanting to recycle. ""There's pressures on consumers 12 months of the year to consume, consume, consume,"" he added. ""We want consumers to take a pause and look at how they consume - not stop consuming, but just look at some other way to consume that's more responsible and healthier for the environment."" For Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, there's no doubt that traders have a part to play in reaching environmental targets such as reducing waste and hitting net zero. He points out that Retail NI members are part of initiatives such as the carrier bag levy, which ""brought over £14m into green and recyclable and sustainable projects"", and offering refill options so people can bring stock up on household projects by filling their own containers. ""I think reduction has a role to play, but certainly not in encouraging consumers not to spend,"" he said. Mr Roberts said he supported a ""green New Deal mark II"" but that it needed co-operation between environmental and business groups. ""It's only when we can co-design these efforts will we have that successful partnership approach and start to see the step-change and real change that we need to reach net zero."" Marie Nancarrow, from Titanic Denim which repurposes denim and other discarded fabrics, said she's always been a charity shop browser. ""I was taking pre-loved jeans and pre-loved garments, cutting up the garments and patching the jeans. And then I discovered that what I was actually doing was sustainable design,"" she said. The process creates bespoke pieces and helps the environment, she said - a win, win. ""I'm giving garments fabrics and materials a second life that they probably wouldn't have had before and would have ended up in landfill contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. ""I definitely believe there's a new movement, it's been happening over the last five years. That has been supported massively by social media. ""And, of course, that has given new ideas to people to be more conscious consumers, rather than to just buy constantly, and to look for other ways of buying clothes."" Ana Desmond, a senior economist at Ulster University Economic Policy Centre, said we need to move to a ""more circular economy where we reduce our consumption, reuse products, and then they're recycled as the final stage of the product"". ""It's really difficult, especially when we live in a world of influencers and large marketing campaigns where we're encouraged to buy and consume more,"" she said. ""So what we need to do is shift not only the mindset of consumers but of employers and creators as well manufacturers, so we move towards products that are more durable, but we also then need to market that durability, reusing and repairing products so that we get further use out of them and convey the benefits of those to consumers as well. ""We're talking about maybe moving people from industries and productions that are less efficient towards those that are more sustainable."" Ms Desmond said that the transition wouldn't happen overnight. ""It's a long transition, but it's something that's becoming more and more necessary as we see climate change coming more to the forefront of people's agendas."" You may remember a campaign from the turn of the century: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Recycling took off in a big way here - we now recycle 45.7% of our waste and some of it is recovered to be used for energy. But a quarter still goes to landfill. It's almost as though the first two steps of that slogan didn't really register. Reduce was first for a reason - when you cut down on what you are consuming, you will reduce what goes to landfill or for recycling. And recycling is the very final stage when an item's usefulness has been exhausted by reuse, repair and repurposing - finding new ways to support your local economy and protect the environment.","['Recycling', 'NI economy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/159E2/production/_132264588_chrisgourley.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10BC2/production/_132264586_glynnroberts.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BDA2/production/_132264584_marienancarrow.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11D88/production/_132269037_213d2657-7cac-42e0-802e-0f68da531af2_upload.jpg']","['By Louise Cullen', 'BBC NI agriculture and environment correspondent']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67932289,Post Office scandal: 'They did everything to stop justice',A former sub-postmaster who had a fraud conviction quashed as part of the Post Office scandal has said something needs to be done to help those waiting for vindication.,2024-01-10,"A former sub-postmaster who had a fraud conviction quashed as part of the Post Office scandal has said something needs to be done to help those waiting for vindication. More than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted based on data from faulty Horizon software between 1999 and 2015. Some people went to prison for false accounting and theft, while others were financially ruined. Alan McLaughlin said that 20 years of his life was taken from him. In 2022, his conviction for fraud-related offences was overturned by the Court of Appeal. While the scandal has been public knowledge for some time, an ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which aired last week, catapulted the issue back into the spotlight. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the government would bring in a new law to ""swiftly"" exonerate and compensate victims. He was addressing the scandal in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. The law will not automatically apply in Northern Ireland or Scotland, but Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake said that Downing Street was ""keen"" to extend the provisions. The courts system in Northern Ireland is different from England and Wales. A public inquiry into the scandal began in February 2021 and will resume again on Thursday after breaking for Christmas. Mr McLaughlin said the Post Office stopped at nothing to cover up the scandal. ""People haven't realised the extent to which the Post Office has continued to use their powers, all the resources of a publicly-owned corporation, all for the purpose of stymieing the process of appeals and the process of compensation. ""They have done everything in their power to stop this."" he added. Mr McLaughlin said he lost decades of his life and the scandal has damaged many lives. ""There's 20 years of my life, which didn't turn out the way that I had planned them to,"" he added. ""There are several thousand people in the same position, who had livelihoods damaged, reputations damaged, health damaged. ""So it's been it's been quite a range of of things which were inflicted upon people by a publicly-owned body."" He said that, even with vindication, that does not take away from what he lost. Deirdre Connolly, from County Tyrone, was one of a number of people from Northern Ireland who were wrongly accused. She lost her job at Killeter Post Office in 2010 and had to borrow money from her family to pay more than £15,500 to the Post Office. She feels the prime minister did not go far enough. ""I didn't hear an apology, it lasted only 30 seconds, there are no details. I don't have much faith at the moment,"" she said. ""I thought the convictions could have been overturned in one swoop today. That would have been the best thing"". Speaking after Mr Sunak spoke in parliament, Fiona Elliott, a former sub-postmistress from County Tyrone said she was ""happy"". ""They are realising what has went wrong and admitting responsibility for everything. ""I am glad now that everybody know all these people were all innocent at the end of the day."" She told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today that the whole ordeal was still raw and difficult to process. Ms Elliott said that she and her husband bought the Post Office and shop in the rural village of Clady, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland in 2005. She hoped it would help provide financial security for her family in the future. ""Every week we were getting a lot discrepancies and shortfalls in the system,"" Ms Elliott told the programme. ""I kept putting the money in from the shop to the Post Office to keep it right but we never had a plus, it was always minus, the money was just disappearing in front of us."" Ms Elliott said she had contacted the Post Office a number of times and requested that they carry out an audit. When they did this, they discovered a £6,000 shortfall, which she then had to pay straight away. Ms Elliott was then suspended for a number of weeks before the Post Office later confirmed there would be no further action. She was offered redundancy at a time when rural post offices were closing, and resigned in 2008. Speaking to the inquiry back in May 2022, Ms Elliot recalled looking through bins at night time in a bid to account for money lost through the faulty IT system. Ms Elliott said she watched the ITV programme and said it was incredibly powerful, but also made her feel angry and annoyed that ""so many people have suffered and lives have been destroyed"". ""There were so many people involved, thousands and many more people may come forward after the programme."" The former sub-postmistress said she wants anyone responsible for the scandal brought before the courts to answer for it. She said she had not been able to make peace with her own experience yet and believes holding people accountable will help her find closure.",['Post Office Inquiry'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/254A/production/_132264590_alanmclaughlin.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/150F7/production/_104636268_fiona.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2907/production/_132230501_gettyimages-1916826347.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D9D8/production/_132186755_mr_bates_vs_the_post_office_02.jpg']",,UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67938183,Monuments in Northern Ireland: Man fined £50k for demolishing kilns,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim.",2024-01-10,"A building contractor has been fined £50,000 for demolishing a protected historic monument on a site he intended to develop in County Antrim. Henry James Price, from Glenavy Road, Lisburn, recently pleaded guilty to destroying a set of 19th Century lime kilns on land he owned in Moneybroom. The judge said it was the first prosecution of its kind in Northern Ireland. Fining Price, he said saying there must be a deterrent to dissuade others. The judge at Craigavon Crown Court added that the defendant's culpability was high given he knew the kilns were protected yet he still chose to cause ""irreparable damage"" to them. During the case, the court was told that 64-year-old Price is both a farmer and a director of a successful house building firm, JH Price and Sons Ltd. He bought the site on Moneybroom Road for £270,000 in June 2019.  It is close to his home and he was already in possession of some adjoining land. In August 2020, Price lodged an application with the council to secure the site and potentially develop a small portion of it, but the project was hit by delays. His site contained a large, protected structure known as the Moneybroom lime kilns. There were a number of limestone quarries in the Lisburn area and during the Victorian era kilns were built to produce lime for the agriculture and construction industries. The court heard that a chartered architect estimated it would have cost about £630,000 to restore the kilns to their original condition. Because they were protected monuments, a grant of up to £50,000 would have been available towards the restoration, but that still left Price facing a substantial bill. On 16 April 2021, police were called to the site following a report of building works taking place where protected monuments were situated. Officers discovered the kilns had been demolished and when they interviewed Price in September that year, he admitted he had ordered his employees to clear them. He apologised for destroying the kilns at that time, but told police he believed they were ""structurally dangerous"". Price also claimed to police there had been significant antisocial behaviour at the site, particularly at night and ""he was afraid of someone getting killed"". The Moneybroom kilns were most likely constructed between 1870 and 1900, according to an estimate by the Historic Environment Division (HED), an agency within Stormont's Department of Communities. The judge said these were the only kilns of their type in Northern Ireland and were ""an almost unique example of this type of industrial architecture"". In a mitigation plea, a defence barrister said Price ""accepts without reservation that he made a grave error and that the demolition of the lime kilns should never have taken place"". But he added that ""the integrity of the kilns was not jealously guarded by the department over the years"", pointing out there had been a lack of investment and no departmental plan to restore them. The barrister said his client had spent about £50,000 to secure the site and replant trees. He added Price had also lost his single farm payment and ""by virtue of his conduct it is now simply not possible for the defendant to develop the site in any way that would generate any profit - he has closed that particular avenue off for good"". The judge acknowledged that the kilns were not visible from the road, were not a money-generating tourist attraction and that their value was subjective. He also conceded that with no plan to repair them, they would eventually have fallen apart by themselves. Nevertheless, he said there had to be a deterrent to dissuade others who ""may be tempted to play fast and loose"" with legislation protecting other historical monuments. Giving Price credit for his guilty pleas and clear record, the judge told the defendant that if had he not admitted the offence, the fine would have been £75,000. Price was allowed six months to pay. In a statement, Brian McKervey, acting director of the Historic Environment Division (HED), said: ""We welcome the court's recognition that our heritage is an important and finite resource and an appreciation that once gone, these sites are impossible to replace. ""Not only did Moneybroom lime kilns, which date back to the 1800s, provide a unique example of a time when our society was undergoing massive change, they were a reminder of many aspects of our shared heritage, including the industrialisation of our landscape and society."" He added: ""HED appreciates the pressures that scheduled monument owners can face and one of our primary aims is to support them and facilitate their needs, where possible."" But he said the department will ""work with criminal justice partners to pursue prosecutions where warranted, in particular when historic monuments have been damaged or destroyed"".","['Listed buildings', 'Lisburn', 'Architecture']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C61D/production/_132271705_moneybroom_ant_063-500-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/54D5/production/_132271712_moneybroom_ant_063-500.jpg']",,UK,N.

Kevin Conway was killed in Rossnareen Park in the Greenan area of west Belfast on Tuesday night. The 26-year-old was on bail after being charged with the January 2023 murder of Mr Whitla, a shooting linked to an organised crime gang known as the Firm. During court hearings in 2023 it was said Mr Conway was under threat. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said paramedics were called just before 21:30 GMT on Tuesday, but Mr Conway died at the scene. Police remain in Rossnareen Park, where cordons are in place. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Det Insp Gina Quinn said it was a ""horrific, calculated and ruthless murder carried out in a busy residential area"". Det Insp Quinn said Mr Conway was shot ""multiple times"" and pronounced dead at the scene. ""Such cold-blooded brutality has absolutely no place in our society,"" she said. ""This isn't about what Kevin may or may not have been linked to, this is about trying to find his killers. Any incidents linked to Kevin form part of the ongoing police investigation and will be looked at as a line of enquiry."" There will be an increased police presence in the area in the coming days, Belfast West MP, Sinn Féin's Paul Maskey, described Tuesday's shooting as a brutal killing. ""There is no place for guns on our streets,"" he said. Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor Paul Doherty said the incident had sent shockwaves through the community. ""Following on from previous incidents in the area in recent days local people are seriously concerned at this outbreak of criminality as we begin the new year,"" he added. People Before Profit assembly member Gerry Carroll also condemned the killing. ""There can be no justification for gunning someone down in their home in cold blood,"" he said, ""All right-thinking people will be abhorred by this shooting."" There are about 60 organised crime gangs operating in Northern Ireland, according to a report published last year based on police assessments. The Firm is one of the most talked about. It has been implicated in two previous murders - Malcolm McKeown in Warringstown in 2019 and Shane Whitla in Lurgan. Both were shot dead. The gang largely operates out of Lurgan and Portadown in County Armagh.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67928491,Sunak says Strikes in NI could be avoided by Stormont return,"The prime minister has said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored.",2024-01-10,"The prime minister has said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored. Rishi Sunak was speaking after Unite confirmed it would join 14 other unions across the public sector in a major strike on 18 January. Unite's deputy regional secretary David Thompson said frustration and anger had built up among unions. Unions have billed it as the biggest strike in the history of NI. Mr Sunak said ""significant progress"" has been made in talks with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and there was ""now a very good basis"" to revive the power-sharing institutions. He was speaking in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. Northern Ireland's devolved government collapsed in February 2022 after the DUP withdrew in protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The party has been seeking further legal assurances from Westminster of Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market. In December, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Stormont if an executive is restored. Mr Sunak said with the government's financial offer for Northern Ireland, there was ""a real chance to restore the executive, resolve pay for public sector workers rapidly, and get Northern Ireland and its public services moving again"". The DUP did not decide to end its boycott despite the government's offer in December. Teachers, nurses, health workers and civil servants will join transport workers in the ""generalised day of action"". Unite said 8,000 of its members would take part in the industrial action as part of an ongoing pay dispute, including 2,300 Translink staff. Mr Thompson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that he acknowledged the action would affect the public. ""I would ask this question: is the impact on the public next Thursday greater than the decades of under-investment in our public services? I would suggest no,"" he said. ""The under-investment has created havoc in our public services across Northern Ireland and has impacted everybody within Northern Ireland. ""We now have a secretary of state who has made it clear just before Christmas that he has the money, he's just not willing to pay it. ""It seems he's using people as a bargaining chip in a game of politics which is absolutely wrong."" GMB and Siptu members at Translink will also take part in the strike. Translink workers from all three unions held four days of strike action in December, leading to major disruption to bus and train services. The general secretary of Unite, Sharon Graham, said: ""Unite will not allow the livelihoods of workers and the funding of public services to be used as a bargaining chip by this government."" Public transport workers joining strike action next Thursday is not unexpected. Unions had warned last month of further disruption in January in their ongoing dispute over pay. Four days of strike action by Translink workers across three weekends in December had a huge impact on retail and hospitality because it was the busiest time of year for Christmas shoppers and partygoers It led to cancellations and lost sales that business owners told us they were unlikely to get back. A Thursday in January, however, won't have the same impact on those sectors as it's a quieter time for both. It is more likely to affect workers who rely on public transport for their commute, or children going to school. That's not to say next Thursday won't be as disruptive - the scale alone with tens of thousands of public sector workers out on picket lines means it absolutely will be. But the sharp end of the disruption is likely to be felt in schools and hospitals, rather than by private sector businesses as was the case in December. It's difficult to assess the economic impact of public sector strikes here because we don't gather data in the same way as Great Britain. However, Dr Esmond Birnie at Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre who has taken a look at how the picture here compares suggests NI in recent months has been much more strike prone than GB and that next week's action will only consolidate that position. The pay issue has led to a series of strikes by healthcare staff, civil servants, teachers and other workers. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state and the government had no authority to negotiate public sector pay in Northern Ireland. ""It is for the relevant NI departments to negotiate pay policies,"" the spokesperson said. ""The secretary of state has expressed his disappointment that a new executive was not up and running to take the offer on the table and deliver it for the people of Northern Ireland before Christmas. ""It is now for the NI parties to come together, restore the Executive and begin to address the challenges facing the people of Northern Ireland, including public sector pay."" A total of 15 unions have announced they will be taking action on 18 January: These unions represent about 173,000 workers, although not all will be on strike.","['Strike action', 'Unite']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/556D/production/_130096812_unitepicketenniskillen.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1354C/production/_114008197_clodaghrice_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12433/production/_131230847_healthworkersandunionmembersrallyatcityhall007.jpg']","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,N.

The notice of opinion to refuse was issued on Tuesday. Renewable energy firm RES wanted 14 turbines on Unshinagh mountain, in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Antrim Coast and Glens. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council previously expressed concern about the impact on tourism. Northern Ireland has a legally-binding target of generating 80% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2030. A statement said ""due cognisance"" had been given to ""the contribution that renewable energy can make to both the economy and tackling climate change"". But it added that the ""economic and environmental benefits"" had been outweighed by ""the significant harm that would be caused to the landscape"" and the ""ecological impacts"" on protected species"". RES had said the wind farm would be capable of generating enough power to supply 70,000 homes, as well as creating £24.7m in jobs and investment. Jennifer McCorry, the firm's senior development project manager, said it was extremely disappointed by the decision. She said that for Northern Ireland the project would help Northern Ireland to meet renewable energy targets and create up to £5m worth of wages in the 12-month construction period. The decision on the notice of opinion to refuse was taken by the department's permanent secretary under powers laid out in the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act 2022. It is legislation that allows officials to make certain decisions in the absence of ministers. The decision may be appealed up to six weeks after being made. It came as the NI Chamber of Commerce published proposals for the reform of the planning system. Its ideas include legal and regulatory changes alongside improving existing processes. It suggests that statutory consultees, which includes public bodies like NI Water, should face strict deadlines, after which it could be assumed they consent to a planning application. Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of NI Chamber, said: ""A well-performing planning function is key to instilling confidence in the market for potential investors and to enable the development of the required infrastructure, when it comes to connectivity, services, energy and reducing our carbon emissions.""","['Wind farms', 'NI economy', 'Wind power', 'Wind turbines', 'Renewable energy']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A858/production/_132269034_gettyimages-535137064.jpg'],"['By Louise Cullen', 'BBC NI agriculture and environment correspondent']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67928490,Buy Nothing New- can the campaign work?,"Buy Nothing New Month - it sounds straightforward, doesn't it?",2024-01-10,"Buy Nothing New Month - it sounds straightforward, doesn't it? The campaign asks for you to think about your choices as a consumer - do you actually need to buy new, or can you reuse, repair or repurpose something you already own? It began in Great Britain in January 2023 and a quick internet search doesn't reveal any backlash there. But when it launched for the first time here in January 2024, retailers got angry. A social post promoting the scheme in the Ards and North Down Borough Council area recently caught the ire of local business owners who felt it didn't help their prospects in what is traditionally a tough month. That's perhaps not that surprising, given they've battled with the cost-of-living crisis - which is also a cost-of-doing-business crisis - for more than a year and endured a December disrupted by transport strikes. But changing consumer choices is part of the road to addressing our carbon emissions and waste. Northern Ireland generated almost 230,000 tonnes of household waste in the first three months of 2023. That total includes items for recycling and for landfill, and is equivalent to more than 14,000 double decker buses. If we reduce what we use, less demand will be created for the materials that go into those products, fewer things are likely to contribute to landfill or recycling and less stress will be placed on the planet. But that's where the phrase ""just transition"" comes in - it refers to the need for nobody to be disadvantaged or left behind in the move towards greener, more planet-friendly living. If we suddenly and sharply change our consumption of products, that could jeopardise jobs, threaten the economy and make it harder to sustain a transition to lower-emission lifestyles. But we are already off-track on our net zero aims - so if we don't change our habits, we jeopardise the planet we live on. It's a delicate balancing act - and one with different views, on all sides. BBC News NI spoke to three people - a campaigner, the head of a retail organisation and an upcycler - about their views on how to strike the right balance. Chris Gourley, the waste and pollution solutions strategic lead at Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, leads the campaign here and said it could lend itself to support local and small businesses. He said overconsumption was a real problem and the solution was to move away from ""make, take and dispose"". For him, the answer to a circular model: make, take, remake, repair. And he hopes, over time, this will lead to people wanting to recycle. ""There's pressures on consumers 12 months of the year to consume, consume, consume,"" he added. ""We want consumers to take a pause and look at how they consume - not stop consuming, but just look at some other way to consume that's more responsible and healthier for the environment."" For Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, there's no doubt that traders have a part to play in reaching environmental targets such as reducing waste and hitting net zero. He points out that Retail NI members are part of initiatives such as the carrier bag levy, which ""brought over £14m into green and recyclable and sustainable projects"", and offering refill options so people can bring stock up on household projects by filling their own containers. ""I think reduction has a role to play, but certainly not in encouraging consumers not to spend,"" he said. Mr Roberts said he supported a ""green New Deal mark II"" but that it needed co-operation between environmental and business groups. ""It's only when we can co-design these efforts will we have that successful partnership approach and start to see the step-change and real change that we need to reach net zero."" Marie Nancarrow, from Titanic Denim which repurposes denim and other discarded fabrics, said she's always been a charity shop browser. ""I was taking pre-loved jeans and pre-loved garments, cutting up the garments and patching the jeans. And then I discovered that what I was actually doing was sustainable design,"" she said. The process creates bespoke pieces and helps the environment, she said - a win, win. ""I'm giving garments fabrics and materials a second life that they probably wouldn't have had before and would have ended up in landfill contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. ""I definitely believe there's a new movement, it's been happening over the last five years. That has been supported massively by social media. ""And, of course, that has given new ideas to people to be more conscious consumers, rather than to just buy constantly, and to look for other ways of buying clothes."" Ana Desmond, a senior economist at Ulster University Economic Policy Centre, said we need to move to a ""more circular economy where we reduce our consumption, reuse products, and then they're recycled as the final stage of the product"". ""It's really difficult, especially when we live in a world of influencers and large marketing campaigns where we're encouraged to buy and consume more,"" she said. ""So what we need to do is shift not only the mindset of consumers but of employers and creators as well manufacturers, so we move towards products that are more durable, but we also then need to market that durability, reusing and repairing products so that we get further use out of them and convey the benefits of those to consumers as well. ""We're talking about maybe moving people from industries and productions that are less efficient towards those that are more sustainable."" Ms Desmond said that the transition wouldn't happen overnight. ""It's a long transition, but it's something that's becoming more and more necessary as we see climate change coming more to the forefront of people's agendas."" You may remember a campaign from the turn of the century: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Recycling took off in a big way here - we now recycle 45.7% of our waste and some of it is recovered to be used for energy. But a quarter still goes to landfill. It's almost as though the first two steps of that slogan didn't really register. Reduce was first for a reason - when you cut down on what you are consuming, you will reduce what goes to landfill or for recycling. And recycling is the very final stage when an item's usefulness has been exhausted by reuse, repair and repurposing - finding new ways to support your local economy and protect the environment.","['Recycling', 'NI economy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/159E2/production/_132264588_chrisgourley.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10BC2/production/_132264586_glynnroberts.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BDA2/production/_132264584_marienancarrow.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11D88/production/_132269037_213d2657-7cac-42e0-802e-0f68da531af2_upload.jpg']","['By Louise Cullen', 'BBC NI agriculture and environment correspondent']",UK,N.

In England, most students who took exams in November will have been resitting English or maths. Their GCSEs will be graded using a numerical system from 9 to 1. Exams are graded differently in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland has a separate qualifications system to the rest of the UK, with no GCSEs. Senior examiners decide the minimum marks needed for each grade. In England, the summer 2023 grade boundaries were published via the following links for the different exam boards: The main exam board for Wales, WJEC, also published grade boundaries on its website. For those taking GCSEs in Northern Ireland, broad subject grade boundaries were published on the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA) website and the grade boundaries for specific papers were published here. The 9-1 grading scheme was brought in alongside an overhaul of the curriculum in England in 2014. The rollout began in 2017 with three subjects - English language, English literature and maths - being the first to be graded in numbers. By 2020, all subjects were using the new grading system. The highest grade is now 9, while 1 is the lowest. The U grade, meaning ""ungraded"", remains the same. The number scale is not directly equivalent to the old letter one. However, the two scales do meet in certain places: Exams watchdog Ofqual has said fewer grade 9s will have been awarded than A*s ""to identify exceptional performance"". Pupils will have needed a 4 for a ""standard pass"" and 5 for a ""strong pass"". This means that a candidate who gets nine grade-4s has, technically, passed all their exams. However, the government's school league tables are based on the percentage of pupils who achieve a 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs. Many sixth forms insist on a minimum number of 5s or 6s as a condition of entry for further study. The numerical grading scheme was introduced as part of a 2014 curriculum overhaul by then-education secretary, Michael Gove. It put less emphasis on GCSE coursework than before, with grades in almost all subjects decided in final exams. The qualifications were designed to be more challenging, with exams taken after two years of study. Previously pupils covered the syllabus through a series of modules with regular assessments throughout the course. At the time of the changes, the government argued that the new scale ""recognises more clearly the achievements of high-attaining students, as the additional grades allow for greater differentiation"". It also said that the move from letters to numbers would make it clear - for example to an employer - ""whether a student has taken a new, more challenging GCSE, or an old reformed GCSE"". Grades have changed in Northern Ireland too. In summer 2019, the CCEA introduced a new nine-category grade scale - A* to G, including a C*. Students may also get results with grades 9-1 if they take exams set by English boards. The Welsh government introduced new and revised GCSE courses in September 2015. The most significant changes were in English language, Welsh language and mathematics. Wales retained the letter-based grading structure A*- G.","['Exams', 'Wales', 'Young people', 'GCSEs', 'England']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7B05/production/_126039413_gettyimages-838244114.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/86AE/production/_130887443_new_gcse_grading_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/49B5/production/_125996881_6e2e4f7d-c67f-4626-bd44-429287959a41.jpg']",,UK,N.

Katrina Moore, principal of Malone Integrated College, said that to watch a child go hungry was heartbreaking. The secondary school in Finaghy has about 800 pupils, just over half of whom are entitled to free school meals. As a temporary measure to address hunger, Ms Moore is using grant money to provide free food to all her pupils. The principal told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme she was ""very conscious of those young people who I know are probably not going to get a hot meal at any time during the day whether it be breakfast dinner or an evening meal"". ""So for us to be able to provide a hot meal for these young people and their families, to improve their education chances, it's a no brainer,"" she added. In December 2022, Malone Integrated College used grants from the James Kane Foundation to provide breakfasts for hungry pupils on a temporary basis. The charity was set up by the late aerospace entrepreneur Jim Kane from Portadown, County Armagh, who bequeathed his fortune to ""advance education for the public benefit"" in Northern Ireland. Malone Integrated College recently went back to the charity for more help, and currently the school is offering free meals to every pupil until the mid-term break in February. But beyond that date, the college does not have the funds to continue the service. ""I don't know what's going to happen"", Ms Moore said. ""I just don't want any child to go hungry, it's just not fair, it's not right. ""I'm going to make a point of going out and badgering and harassing people as only I can to try and get this to increase to keep it going into the future."" Ms Moore joins a growing list of headteachers who have spoken out about how school budgets are disadvantaging pupils from low income households. Last month, the principal of Brownlow Integrated College in Craigavon, County Armagh told BBC News NI a pupil had fainted due to hunger and families were ""struggling to afford the basics"". Northern Ireland is also the only part of the UK where there is no support available to feed schoolchildren during the school holidays. In March 2023, the school holiday food grant was scrapped by the Department of Education. The fortnightly payment of £27 per child was to help the families of nearly 100,000 pupils entitled to free school meals during term time. At the time the department said it was ending the scheme ""with great reluctance"" but no longer had enough money to fund it.","['School meals', 'Belfast', 'Finaghy', 'NI education']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/129E/production/_132266740_whatsappimage2024-01-10at09.25.50-2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2036/production/_132264280_gettyimages-538487028.jpg']",,UK,N.

Leslie Morrell was agriculture minister in the administration, which was set up in January 1974. It brought unionists and nationalists together in power at Stormont for the first time. Mr Morrell believes the executive might still exist if the government had handled security differently. The cross-party administration, formed after the Sunningdale Agreement in December 1973, was led by Ulster Unionist leader Brian Faulkner and had 11 ministers in total, including John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). However, it lasted only five months. It collapsed in the face of opposition from unionists and loyalists who formed the Ulster Workers' Council (UWC) and called a general strike. The IRA also opposed the Sunningdale agreement and continued its campaign of violence. Mr Morrell, who was deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said it was a missed opportunity. ""I've a great deal of sadness,"" he told BBC News NI. ""The fall of the executive precipitated 25 years of bloodshed, murder, destruction."" He pointed out that 50 years on, there was still no political stability in Northern Ireland. ""The same principles which led to us setting up the executive are still important. If parties are to work together, they need to agree,"" he said. ""They cannot be forced into agreement by some bit of law. They have to have a personal sort of agreement. It took us weeks to achieve that and achieve a respect between the members of the parties."" Back in 1974, there were six unionists on the executive - Mr Faulkner, Mr Morrell, Basil McIvor, Roy Bradford, Herbert Kirk and John Baxter. Representing the SDLP were leader Gerry Fitt, Mr Hume, Paddy Devlin and Austin Currie. The sole Alliance Party minister was their leader Oliver Napier. ""It was a very definite change,"" said Mr Morrell. ""Among the people who were sitting around that table were people who were regarded by some of the Protestant population as being enemies of the state."" He said ministers were able to concentrate on health, education, agriculture and the economy because constitutional issues had been dealt with the previous year. ""We were making it work - that is why we had to be stopped,"" he said. According to Mr Morrell, the loyalist workers who blocked roads did not have the support of the majority of unionists and should have been subjected to more robust action. ""What it required was action to clear the roads,"" he said. If that had happened, he believes ""the executive or its successors would still be there"". Mr Faulkner and the other unionist ministers resigned in May 1974, bringing an end to the power-sharing experiment. It was a violent period of time, with loyalist paramilitaries and the IRA both armed and active - Mr Morrell carried a gun for his own protection. He was one of seven representatives from the Londonderry constituency, where John Hume topped the poll in the June 1973 ssembly election. Although it was five decades ago, Mr Morrell remembers the 1974 executive well. He recalls being worried about his lack of ministerial experience, even though, as a farmer, he was comfortable with the agriculture brief. Before his first time answering questions in the Stormont Assembly, he remembers the advice Brian Faulkner gave him: ""If the questioner is a member of your own party, you give them an answer and satisfy them. ""If it's a member of another party, you tell them as little as possible."" At the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland, staff produced original files to BBC News NI from the 1974 executive plus official photographs taken of ministers, including Mr Morrell. Looking at the pictures, he recalled the intensive negotiations at Stormont Castle in 1973 that led to the power-sharing executive, and a comment which he will never forget. ""Basil McIvor said going up the steps (to Stormont Castle): 'This will be the political end of some of us',"" he said. ""He was right. But we had to try it.""","['Northern Ireland Assembly', 'Belfast', 'The Troubles', 'UK devolution']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5B82/production/_132262432_img_6125.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/145E2/production/_132262438_img_6185.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/103DE/production/_132262566_img_6109.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A9A2/production/_132262434_img_6177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/79A0/production/_132263113_img_6097.jpg']","['By Mark Simpson', 'BBC News NI community correspondent']",UK,N.

Barn owl eggs are usually laid in April, with fledging beginning in June or July depending on the weather. However, the latest brood fledged - that is, learned to fly - in December, causing shock amongst conservationists. The barn owl is one of Northern Ireland's rarest birds and is red-listed on the Irish Birds of Conservation Concern and protected under the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985. There are fewer than 30 breeding pairs estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, which has made the discovery all the more exciting. Katy Bell, a senior conservation officer at Ulster Wildlife, said she ""couldn't believe"" it when she was sent an audio recording of the chicks snoring and rasping. ""A visit confirmed the exciting news, but our main concern was whether the chicks would survive given the extremely wet weather and floods,"" she said. Despite the fact barn owls struggle to hunt in wet conditions, Ms Bell added, the odds were in their favour as small mammals fleeing providing easy prey. The team returned a few weeks later and were ""ecstatic"" to bring in the four healthy chicks. ""This is the second consecutive year barn owls have bred at Ballycruttle Farm - a real testament to their wildlife-rich habitats and practices,"" Ms Bell added. However, the story behind the Ballycruttle brood is not too dissimilar to a typical soap opera plot. Last March, a clattering of jackdaws forced the female from her nest box to a nearby farm, managed by the Kelly family. The female and a nearby male, who had been hunting on the Kelly farm for many years, then bred and the pair had one chick late last summer. However, back in Ballycruttle, the male barn owl kept calling for the female to return. She eventually conceded, leaving the chick in the hands of the male who continued to feed it. With the pair reunited back in their original nest box, she then lay another clutch of eggs. Dawn Stocking of Ballycruttle Farm said the ""nail-biting"" story kept them on their toes. ""I was, of course, disappointed when the female jumped ship to my neighbour's fantastic farm and thought that we weren't going to see any chicks at Ballycruttle this year at all,"" she said. ""So, you can imagine my utter excitement when I heard babies snoring from the nest box - it was like Christmas had come early!"" Wildlife cameras were installed to catch the brood's antics, catching everything from wing stretches, small hops and even the chicks' first flights. ""It has been absolutely magical,"" Ms Stocking added. Both Ballycruttle Farm and Kelly's Farm are part of a project in County Down to halt and reserve the decline of barn owls led by RSPB NI. Michelle Duggan from the charity said it was a delight to see the work carried out by the nature-friendly farms yield positive results. ""The valuable seed-rich habitats maintained on both farms are an essential winter food source for the endangered yellowhammer, and also ideal hunting territory for barn owls to catch small mammal prey,"" she said. ""Healthy hedgerows combined with areas of rough grassland allow barn owls to expand their hunting territory even further."" The chicks have also been rigged to help identify and keep track of the birds' movement.","['RSPB', 'Wildlife', 'Owls', 'Conservation']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/90B5/production/_132254073_barnowlchickbeingweighed.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/105E5/production/_132254076_katybellulsterwildlifedawnstockingballycruttlefarm-michelledugganrspbni.jpg']",,UK,N.

Workers will receive the UK government's national minimum wage of £11.44 an hour from April - below the £12 cost of living-based rate. The Aberdeenshire-based firm said the move was ""necessary"" as part of an effort to return to profitability after making a £24m operating loss last year. But former staff have accused the company of ""abandoning its principles"" over the move. A letter to employees, seen by BBC Scotland News, said ""hard decisions"" had to be taken in order to maintain financial stability despite a ""bumper"" festive period. Brewdog, founded by James Watt and Martin Dickie, had paid the voluntary wage since 2015. Bryan Simpson, hospitality organiser of Unite, said: ""To withdraw the real living wage now, during the most acute cost of living crisis in a generation is outrageous. ""We are already working with our Brewdog members across the country to collectively challenge this awful decision and force the senior management of the company to do the right thing by the workers who have made them millions."" The real living wage is independently calculated based on living standards in the UK and is separate from the government's national living wage. The rate will increase to £12 an hour outside London and £13.15 for workers in the English capital on 1 April in line with inflation. Brewdog staff over the age of 23 will receive a slight pay rise, but only from £10.90 to £11.44. Those working in London will see no increase from their current rate of £11.95. Blog posts on the brewer's website referencing its status as a living wage employer have been removed. The Punks with Purpose campaign group for ex-workers, set up amid mistreatment allegations in 2021, said: ""The real Living Wage has been a cornerstone of BrewDog's public identity for years. ""This real-terms pay cut for hard-working front line staff proves there is no principle too dearly held for them to abandon and is directly opposed to BrewDog's previous claim that their 'crew are their most important resource' and giving them fair pay for the work they do is one of their 'core beliefs'."" Brewdog's revenue grew to £321.2m in the 2022-23 financial year, but the firm blamed a £24m operating loss on increased production costs for its most popular product, Punk IPA, and rising energy bills at its Ellon plant. Its co-founder, Mr Watt, previously apologised to staff after a BBC Disclosure documentary in 2022 heard claims of inappropriate behaviour A spokesperson for the company said: ""As a result of the changes we're making - and despite unprecedented challenges in the hospitality sector - our staff outside London will be getting a 4.95% increase in base pay, and crew currently working in London will be paid 4.5% above the National Living Wage. ""We have always been fully committed to doing the best we can for our people, and our benefits package is far more generous than the industry average.""","['Scotland business', 'Companies', 'Ellon', 'BrewDog']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5554/production/_125544812_gettyimages-1216607911.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1136B/production/_132270507_jameswatt.png']",,UK,Scotland

Ronald Hathway repeatedly assaulted one child, raped a second victim three times and committed a further attempted rape on her. A court heard the crimes were committed in the late 1990s when Hathaway was aged between 12 and 14. Hathway, 39, was placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely. The court was told the first victim was aged eight or nine at the time of the offences and the second aged six or seven. Hathway had denied a series of charges during an earlier trial. But he was found guilty of five offences - one of indecent conduct, three of rape and one of attempted rape. Defence solicitor advocate Kris Gilmartin said Hathway had previous convictions but they were not for sexual offending. And he told the High Court in Edinburgh 25 years had elapsed with no similar offending occurring.

It is a miserable situation for the housebuilding firm and its boss Stewart Milne - who was once hailed as a Scottish business success story. Starting out as a young electrician - with a love of football - Milne went on to dominate the construction business in the north east and serve as chairman of Aberdeen FC. The 73-year-old said he was ""devastated"" by the collapse of the company he founded in 1975 and was ""struggling to accept it"". Milne had postponed retirement in an attempt to secure a future for the firm that he poured his working life into. Raised in Alford, Aberdeenshire, he was the youngest of five boys. His father was a farm worker and his mother was an auxiliary nurse. ""It was a tough upbringing,"" Milne said in a 2004 interview with the Sunday Times. ""We lived in a tiny cottage with just three rooms and no electricity until I was 14."" Milne said he had little interest in studying at school but sport was his passion. He trained as an electrician and gained a City & Guilds qualification in 1971. In partnership with a plumber, Milne got his foothold in the industry by renovating flats in Aberdeen. He found he had no shortage of work in the 1970s as the city's tenement housing stock needed extensive modernisation. By 1975 he had set up himself as a housebuilder employing 30 people. His company pioneered rapid timber frame construction that gave them an advantage over his competitors at the time. Milne boasted that his teams could complete jobs in weeks that would take rival firms months. After the oil price slump hit the north east economy in the late-1980s, Milne expanded into central Scotland and it became his biggest area of operation. Stewart Milne Group eventually had offices in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester and a workforce of more than 1,000 people. Milne also became a major shareholder in Aberdeen FC. He joined the Pittodrie club's board of directors in 1994 and became chairman in 1998. He announced he was stepping down as chairman in 2019 but remains on the board. His departure from the club came just weeks after former manager Sir Alex Ferguson opened Cormack Park, a new £12m training facility. Aberdeen FC has confirmed that it has not been affected by the collapse of the Stewart Milne Group. Milne's career was recognised with a CBE for services to construction in 2008. He received honorary doctorates from Robert Gordon University, Napier University and Heriot-Watt University as well as a lifetime achievement award from industry body Homes for Scotland. Jane Wood, chief executive of Homes for Scotland, said she was ""surprised and saddened"" by the company's collapse. Stewart Milne Group was put up for sale in April 2022 after Milne announced his retirement, which he later postponed in a bid to secure the firm's future. He said at the time: ""After considerable soul-searching, I have decided that the time is right to step back from the business I founded to prioritise my time for family, friends and other ventures."" His company was hit hard by the Covid pandemic, which saw construction firms forced to down tools for months. In the year to October 2020 Stewart Milne Group recorded a pre-tax loss of £71.5m on turnover of £269.7m. In December 2021, the firm sold its timber frame business to focus on housebuilding in its core markets in Scotland and north west England. By October 2022 it had recorded annual pre-tax profits of £16.5m. However, turnover fell to £172.4m as its house sales fell by nearly 30% to 583. The initial sale was suspended due to ""economic uncertainty"". It was relisted in July 2023, but failed to attract a viable buyer. It has now entered administration with the immediate loss of more than 200 jobs, with hundreds of other sub-contractors expected to be impacted. Lloyds Banking Group said it had attempted to find a solution that would place the business on a ""sounder financial footing"" and avoid insolvency. Mr Milne said that two bids were made to buy his firm after ""significant interest"", but Lloyds did not accept them and withdrew funding. ""I believe one of the bids could have delivered a comparable, financial return to administration and, crucially, allowed the business to continue to operate, safeguarding hundreds of jobs and protecting livelihoods,"" he added. ""I tried everything I could to find a way to achieve a better outcome for the business and the people who depend on it.""","['Scotland business', 'Construction industry', 'Aberdeen']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/18124/production/_132269589_milne.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10FDC/production/_132269596_stonehaven.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1640/production/_132269650_19605188.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B70/production/_132269653_castlewellan-002.jpg']","['By Paul Hastie', 'BBC Scotland']",UK,Scotland

Vinyl, which was formerly known as Club De Mar, became a favourite of clubbers after opening in December 1989. It became Ayrshire's oldest nightclub before closing in 2017. It has operated under the rebranded name of Vinyl for the last six years. Owners say they will now focus their efforts on hosting large-scale events. Under the Club De Mar name, it played host to acts such as the Bay City Rollers, Showaddywaddy and The Drifters. More recently it played host to up-and-coming DJs including Ayr's own Ewan McVicar. The platinum-selling DJ credits his time as a regular DJ in the town's ""legendary clubs"" Club De Mar and Furys as inspiration for a music festival he staged in the town last year. The venue played an important role in Ayrshire's rave scene back in the 90s and early noughties alongside clubs such as Hanger 13 inside the Ayr Pavilion and the Metro in Saltcoats. The club has blamed licensing regulations put in place by the local council for the sudden closure. On Facebook, a spokesperson said: ""We have not made this decision lightly but due to the nature of the statement of licensing policy set out by South Ayrshire Council Licensing Board, and the changing nature of nightlife in the post-Covid era, it has become increasingly difficult to operate as a 'nightclub'."" Current rules mean pubs and bars are permitted to stay open as late as nightclubs. The statement said a decision not to permit ""differential opening times"" between different types of licensed premises has made it ""no longer viable"" to operate a nightclub in the council area. As a event space the venue will work with promoters and artists to host one-off large-scale events, with the first, an evening with DJ Subterra: KIMMIC, due to take place on March 29. The statement of licensing policy approved by councillors in October noted a request to amend the policy to allow a distinct type of license for nightclubs to be introduced but felt the current policy didn't need to be amended. A South Ayrshire Council spokesperson said: ""The licensing board took a decision last autumn to maintain the current licensing policy. A public consultation informed their decision.""","['Nightclubs', 'Ayr']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4520/production/_132269671_picture2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B7F8/production/_130069074_ew-backtaeayr_background.png']",,UK,Scotland

It is a miserable situation for the housebuilding firm and its boss Stewart Milne - who was once hailed as a Scottish business success story. Starting out as a young electrician - with a love of football - Milne went on to dominate the construction business in the north east and serve as chairman of Aberdeen FC. The 73-year-old said he was ""devastated"" by the collapse of the company he founded in 1975 and was ""struggling to accept it"". Milne had postponed retirement in an attempt to secure a future for the firm that he poured his working life into. Raised in Alford, Aberdeenshire, he was the youngest of five boys. His father was a farm worker and his mother was an auxiliary nurse. ""It was a tough upbringing,"" Milne said in a 2004 interview with the Sunday Times. ""We lived in a tiny cottage with just three rooms and no electricity until I was 14."" Milne said he had little interest in studying at school but sport was his passion. He trained as an electrician and gained a City & Guilds qualification in 1971. In partnership with a plumber, Milne got his foothold in the industry by renovating flats in Aberdeen. He found he had no shortage of work in the 1970s as the city's tenement housing stock needed extensive modernisation. By 1975 he had set up himself as a housebuilder employing 30 people. His company pioneered rapid timber frame construction that gave them an advantage over his competitors at the time. Milne boasted that his teams could complete jobs in weeks that would take rival firms months. After the oil price slump hit the north east economy in the late-1980s, Milne expanded into central Scotland and it became his biggest area of operation. Stewart Milne Group eventually had offices in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester and a workforce of more than 1,000 people. Milne also became a major shareholder in Aberdeen FC. He joined the Pittodrie club's board of directors in 1994 and became chairman in 1998. He announced he was stepping down as chairman in 2019 but remains on the board. His departure from the club came just weeks after former manager Sir Alex Ferguson opened Cormack Park, a new £12m training facility. Aberdeen FC has confirmed that it has not been affected by the collapse of the Stewart Milne Group. Milne's career was recognised with a CBE for services to construction in 2008. He received honorary doctorates from Robert Gordon University, Napier University and Heriot-Watt University as well as a lifetime achievement award from industry body Homes for Scotland. Jane Wood, chief executive of Homes for Scotland, said she was ""surprised and saddened"" by the company's collapse. Stewart Milne Group was put up for sale in April 2022 after Milne announced his retirement, which he later postponed in a bid to secure the firm's future. He said at the time: ""After considerable soul-searching, I have decided that the time is right to step back from the business I founded to prioritise my time for family, friends and other ventures."" His company was hit hard by the Covid pandemic, which saw construction firms forced to down tools for months. In the year to October 2020 Stewart Milne Group recorded a pre-tax loss of £71.5m on turnover of £269.7m. In December 2021, the firm sold its timber frame business to focus on housebuilding in its core markets in Scotland and north west England. By October 2022 it had recorded annual pre-tax profits of £16.5m. However, turnover fell to £172.4m as its house sales fell by nearly 30% to 583. The initial sale was suspended due to ""economic uncertainty"". It was relisted in July 2023, but failed to attract a viable buyer. It has now entered administration with the immediate loss of more than 200 jobs, with hundreds of other sub-contractors expected to be impacted. Lloyds Banking Group said it had attempted to find a solution that would place the business on a ""sounder financial footing"" and avoid insolvency. Mr Milne said that two bids were made to buy his firm after ""significant interest"", but Lloyds did not accept them and withdrew funding. ""I believe one of the bids could have delivered a comparable, financial return to administration and, crucially, allowed the business to continue to operate, safeguarding hundreds of jobs and protecting livelihoods,"" he added.

Katie Allan, 21, was found dead in her cell at Polmont Young Offenders Institute on 4 June 2018. She was convicted in March 2018 after admitting a drink driving offence. The inquiry is looking into whether the deaths of Ms Allan and 16-year-old William Brown, also known as William Lindsay, could have been prevented. Mr Brown took his own life in October 2018, four months after Ms Allan. He had been remanded in custody after being deemed a ""potential risk to public safety"" three days before his death. Polmont prison officer Heather Morrison was allocated as a personal officer to Ms Allan and described her as ""lovely and open"".

Ms Morrison said she could not remember if any verbal abuse was directed at Ms Allan, and added that it was ""just part of the culture"" in Polmont. Ms Morrison told the inquiry how Ms Allan had a positive effect on one of the young women in her hall who was a ""difficult individual"". The inquiry also heard how she had denied any thoughts of suicide during a transfer to the young offenders institution, near Falkirk. She was remanded in Cornton Vale women's prison and sent to Polmont to complete her 16-month sentence. Ms Allan took her own life three months later. Alan MacFarlane spoke to Ms Allan when she was transferred. The inquiry previously heard how she had a history of self-harming but this was not noted on the transfer form.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67932569,Craft beer giant Brewdog abandons real living wage for employees,Craft beer giant Brewdog will no longer pay its employees the real living wage.,2024-01-10,"Craft beer giant Brewdog will no longer pay its employees the real living wage. Workers will receive the UK government's national minimum wage of £11.44 an hour from April - below the £12 cost of living-based rate. The Aberdeenshire-based firm said the move was ""necessary"" as part of an effort to return to profitability after making a £24m operating loss last year. But former staff have accused the company of ""abandoning its principles"" over the move. A letter to employees, seen by BBC Scotland News, said ""hard decisions"" had to be taken in order to maintain financial stability despite a ""bumper"" festive period. Brewdog, founded by James Watt and Martin Dickie, had paid the voluntary wage since 2015. Bryan Simpson, hospitality organiser of Unite, said: ""To withdraw the real living wage now, during the most acute cost of living crisis in a generation is outrageous. ""We are already working with our Brewdog members across the country to collectively challenge this awful decision and force the senior management of the company to do the right thing by the workers who have made them millions."" The real living wage is independently calculated based on living standards in the UK and is separate from the government's national living wage. The rate will increase to £12 an hour outside London and £13.15 for workers in the English capital on 1 April in line with inflation. Brewdog staff over the age of 23 will receive a slight pay rise, but only from £10.90 to £11.44. Those working in London will see no increase from their current rate of £11.95. Blog posts on the brewer's website referencing its status as a living wage employer have been removed. The Punks with Purpose campaign group for ex-workers, set up amid mistreatment allegations in 2021, said: ""The real Living Wage has been a cornerstone of BrewDog's public identity for years. ""This real-terms pay cut for hard-working front line staff proves there is no principle too dearly held for them to abandon and is directly opposed to BrewDog's previous claim that their 'crew are their most important resource' and giving them fair pay for the work they do is one of their 'core beliefs'."" Brewdog's revenue grew to £321.2m in the 2022-23 financial year, but the firm blamed a £24m operating loss on increased production costs for its most popular product, Punk IPA, and rising energy bills at its Ellon plant. Its co-founder, Mr Watt, previously apologised to staff after a BBC Disclosure documentary in 2022 heard claims of inappropriate behaviour A spokesperson for the company said: ""As a result of the changes we're making - and despite unprecedented challenges in the hospitality sector - our staff outside London will be getting a 4.95% increase in base pay, and crew currently working in London will be paid 4.5% above the National Living Wage. ""We have always been fully committed to doing the best we can for our people, and our benefits package is far more generous than the industry average.""","['Scotland business', 'Companies', 'Ellon', 'BrewDog']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5554/production/_125544812_gettyimages-1216607911.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1136B/production/_132270507_jameswatt.png']",,UK,Scotland

The court was told the first victim was aged eight or nine at the time of the offences and the second aged six or seven. Hathway had denied a series of charges during an earlier trial. But he was found guilty of five offences - one of indecent conduct, three of rape and one of attempted rape. Defence solicitor advocate Kris Gilmartin said Hathway had previous convictions but they were not for sexual offending. And he told the High Court in Edinburgh 25 years had elapsed with no similar offending occurring.

Vinyl, which was formerly known as Club De Mar, became a favourite of clubbers after opening in December 1989. It became Ayrshire's oldest nightclub before closing in 2017. It has operated under the rebranded name of Vinyl for the last six years. Owners say they will now focus their efforts on hosting large-scale events. Under the Club De Mar name, it played host to acts such as the Bay City Rollers, Showaddywaddy and The Drifters. More recently it played host to up-and-coming DJs including Ayr's own Ewan McVicar. The platinum-selling DJ credits his time as a regular DJ in the town's ""legendary clubs"" Club De Mar and Furys as inspiration for a music festival he staged in the town last year. The venue played an important role in Ayrshire's rave scene back in the 90s and early noughties alongside clubs such as Hanger 13 inside the Ayr Pavilion and the Metro in Saltcoats. The club has blamed licensing regulations put in place by the local council for the sudden closure. On Facebook, a spokesperson said: ""We have not made this decision lightly but due to the nature of the statement of licensing policy set out by South Ayrshire Council Licensing Board, and the changing nature of nightlife in the post-Covid era, it has become increasingly difficult to operate as a 'nightclub'."" Current rules mean pubs and bars are permitted to stay open as late as nightclubs. The statement said a decision not to permit ""differential opening times"" between different types of licensed premises has made it ""no longer viable"" to operate a nightclub in the council area. As a event space the venue will work with promoters and artists to host one-off large-scale events, with the first, an evening with DJ Subterra: KIMMIC, due to take place on March 29. The statement of licensing policy approved by councillors in October noted a request to amend the policy to allow a distinct type of license for nightclubs to be introduced but felt the current policy didn't need to be amended. A South Ayrshire Council spokesperson said: ""The licensing board took a decision last autumn to maintain the current licensing policy. A public consultation informed their decision.""","['Nightclubs', 'Ayr']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4520/production/_132269671_picture2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B7F8/production/_130069074_ew-backtaeayr_background.png']",,UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67935857,Complaint lodged against new Police Scotland chief,"The most senior civilian member of the executive team at Police Scotland has lodged a grievance against the force's new Chief Constable, Jo Farrell.",2024-01-10,"The most senior civilian member of the executive team at Police Scotland has lodged a grievance against the force's new Chief Constable, Jo Farrell. David Page is the deputy chief officer at Police Scotland, with responsibility for corporate support. It is understood he made the complaint against the chief constable within weeks of her arrival last October and is currently on sick leave. Mr Page worked in the financial sector before joining the force in 2016. His complaint against Ms Farrell is being dealt with by the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), the body which oversees and governs the force. The SPA has not yet either upheld or dismissed the complaint, and has refused to comment. Mr Page began his career with the Army and spent 10 years in military intelligence before working in Scotland's financial sector for businesses including Standard Life and the Royal Bank of Scotland. When he joined Police Scotland as its deputy chief officer in 2016, he became its most senior civilian member of staff, in charge of areas including finance and people and development. Last year he played a prominent public role when the force was arguing for its budget to be increased. Ms Farrell joined from Durham Constabulary, which she had led since 2019. She was previously assistant chief constable at Northumbria Police. She is the first woman to lead Police Scotland. In November she apologised for an ""error of judgement"" after it emerged that a police officer drove her home to England when her train was cancelled. She was driven about 120 miles from Edinburgh to Northumberland during Storm Babet on 20 October. She had started in the role of Scotland's top police officer just 11 days earlier. It was reported that she was accompanied by the chief finance officer for Durham Constabulary, Gary Ridley. A Durham Constabulary spokesman confirmed that ""an experienced member of staff attended Police Scotland to advise the chief constable about finances and resources"". Police Scotland said the passenger was dropped off a further 15 miles south in Gateshead, Tyneside. While Jo Farrell is having a very bumpy start in her new role, no-one is suggesting her job is under threat. Any outsider taking charge of such a high-profile organisation is bound to ruffle some feathers and, within the force, Ms Farrell is said to have supporters as well as detractors. Her predecessor, Sir Iain Livingstone, was credited with steadying the ship after the premature departure of Police Scotland's first two chief constables, Sir Stephen House and Phil Gormley. Having appointed Ms Farrell, the SPA will be hoping for a similar period of calm as soon as possible. Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Russell Findlay said Police Scotland had often been accused of lacking transparency. He added: ""All public bodies have a duty to be candid about such important issues and I would urge ministers, Police Scotland and the SPA to come clean about exactly what is going on."" And Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said: ""This grievance must be swiftly resolved so that the senior leadership team are all pulling in the same direction.""",['Police Scotland'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/143BD/production/_107277828_jofarrell.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13EBC/production/_132269518_mediaitem132269517.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1682F/production/_132270229_police_pa.jpg']","['By David Cowan', 'Home affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland']",UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67932569,Craft beer giant Brewdog abandons real living wage for employees,Craft beer giant Brewdog will no longer pay its employees the real living wage.,2024-01-10,"Craft beer giant Brewdog will no longer pay its employees the real living wage. Workers will receive the UK government's national minimum wage of £11.44 an hour from April - below the £12 cost of living-based rate. The Aberdeenshire-based firm said the move was ""necessary"" as part of an effort to return to profitability after making a £24m operating loss last year. But former staff have accused the company of ""abandoning its principles"" over the move. A letter to employees, seen by BBC Scotland News, said ""hard decisions"" had to be taken in order to maintain financial stability despite a ""bumper"" festive period. Brewdog, founded by James Watt and Martin Dickie, had paid the voluntary wage since 2015. Bryan Simpson, hospitality organiser of Unite, said: ""To withdraw the real living wage now, during the most acute cost of living crisis in a generation is outrageous. ""We are already working with our Brewdog members across the country to collectively challenge this awful decision and force the senior management of the company to do the right thing by the workers who have made them millions."" The real living wage is independently calculated based on living standards in the UK and is separate from the government's national living wage. The rate will increase to £12 an hour outside London and £13.15 for workers in the English capital on 1 April in line with inflation. Brewdog staff over the age of 23 will receive a slight pay rise, but only from £10.90 to £11.44. Those working in London will see no increase from their current rate of £11.95. Blog posts on the brewer's website referencing its status as a living wage employer have been removed. The Punks with Purpose campaign group for ex-workers, set up amid mistreatment allegations in 2021, said: ""The real Living Wage has been a cornerstone of BrewDog's public identity for years. ""This real-terms pay cut for hard-working front line staff proves there is no principle too dearly held for them to abandon and is directly opposed to BrewDog's previous claim that their 'crew are their most important resource' and giving them fair pay for the work they do is one of their 'core beliefs'."" Brewdog's revenue grew to £321.2m in the 2022-23 financial year, but the firm blamed a £24m operating loss on increased production costs for its most popular product, Punk IPA, and rising energy bills at its Ellon plant. Its co-founder, Mr Watt, previously apologised to staff after a BBC Disclosure documentary in 2022 heard claims of inappropriate behaviour A spokesperson for the company said: ""As a result of the changes we're making - and despite unprecedented challenges in the hospitality sector - our staff outside London will be getting a 4.95% increase in base pay, and crew currently working in London will be paid 4.5% above the National Living Wage. ""We have always been fully committed to doing the best we can for our people, and our benefits package is far more generous than the industry average.""","['Scotland business', 'Companies', 'Ellon', 'BrewDog']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5554/production/_125544812_gettyimages-1216607911.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1136B/production/_132270507_jameswatt.png']",,UK,Scotland

Vinyl, which was formerly known as Club De Mar, became a favourite of clubbers after opening in December 1989. It became Ayrshire's oldest nightclub before closing in 2017. It has operated under the rebranded name of Vinyl for the last six years. Owners say they will now focus their efforts on hosting large-scale events. Under the Club De Mar name, it played host to acts such as the Bay City Rollers, Showaddywaddy and The Drifters. More recently it played host to up-and-coming DJs including Ayr's own Ewan McVicar. The platinum-selling DJ credits his time as a regular DJ in the town's ""legendary clubs"" Club De Mar and Furys as inspiration for a music festival he staged in the town last year. The venue played an important role in Ayrshire's rave scene back in the 90s and early noughties alongside clubs such as Hanger 13 inside the Ayr Pavilion and the Metro in Saltcoats. The club has blamed licensing regulations put in place by the local council for the sudden closure. On Facebook, a spokesperson said: ""We have not made this decision lightly but due to the nature of the statement of licensing policy set out by South Ayrshire Council Licensing Board, and the changing nature of nightlife in the post-Covid era, it has become increasingly difficult to operate as a 'nightclub'."" Current rules mean pubs and bars are permitted to stay open as late as nightclubs. The statement said a decision not to permit ""differential opening times"" between different types of licensed premises has made it ""no longer viable"" to operate a nightclub in the council area. As a event space the venue will work with promoters and artists to host one-off large-scale events, with the first, an evening with DJ Subterra: KIMMIC, due to take place on March 29. The statement of licensing policy approved by councillors in October noted a request to amend the policy to allow a distinct type of license for nightclubs to be introduced but felt the current policy didn't need to be amended. A South Ayrshire Council spokesperson said: ""The licensing board took a decision last autumn to maintain the current licensing policy. A public consultation informed their decision.""","['Nightclubs', 'Ayr']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4520/production/_132269671_picture2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B7F8/production/_130069074_ew-backtaeayr_background.png']",,UK,Scotland

Katie Allan, 21, was found dead in her cell at Polmont Young Offenders Institute on 4 June 2018. She was convicted in March 2018 after admitting a drink driving offence. The inquiry is looking into whether the deaths of Ms Allan and 16-year-old William Brown, also known as William Lindsay, could have been prevented. Mr Brown took his own life in October 2018, four months after Ms Allan. He had been remanded in custody after being deemed a ""potential risk to public safety"" three days before his death. Polmont prison officer Heather Morrison was allocated as a personal officer to Ms Allan and described her as ""lovely and open"". Ms Morrison told the inquiry at Falkirk Sheriff Court: ""To be honest she was different, and not built for prison. ""A lot of the young women have a background with the secure care system. ""They were already used to the kind of system that's in prison. Katie wasn't. ""She was more mature and more grounded than the other girls."" Ms Morrison also said that she did not know Ms Allan had a history of self-harming when she first met her. When asked if it would have been useful to know this, Ms Morrison said every young person who arrived at the facility was vulnerable and it would not have changed the way she worked with her. Ms Morrison was shown a log of intelligence reports which recorded an incident where Ms Allan had been bullied for tobacco in April, however she said she was not aware of this. And just before she died in June, it was recorded that Ms Allan was receiving abuse and threats from inside the prison. The logs also stated that two inmates from her hall were moved to other prisons after Ms Allan's death due to risk concerns. Ms Morrison said she could not remember if any verbal abuse was directed at Ms Allan, and added that it was ""just part of the culture"" in Polmont. Ms Morrison told the inquiry how Ms Allan had a positive effect on one of the young women in her hall who was a ""difficult individual"". The inquiry also heard how she had denied any thoughts of suicide during a transfer to the young offenders institution, near Falkirk. She was remanded in Cornton Vale women's prison and sent to Polmont to complete her 16-month sentence. Ms Allan took her own life three months later. Alan MacFarlane spoke to Ms Allan when she was transferred. The inquiry previously heard how she had a history of self-harming but this was not noted on the transfer form. The question on the form specifically asks ""if the individual has previously attempted suicide or self-harm or if they currently have any thoughts of suicide or self-harm."" Mr MacFarlane's notes read: ""No concerns noted or voiced. Denies strongly any thoughts of self harm or suicidal intentions."" This was recorded on documents which could be seen by prison officers as they did not have access to health records. He told the inquiry that he would observe a person's presentation, demeanour, eye contact, tone and speech during these meetings. The inquiry previously heard how Ms Allan was found to have traces of an antidepressant which was not prescribed to her during a post-mortem examination. At a family visit the day before she died, her mother had told prison officers Ms Allan was being ""berated"" by other prisoners and was ""terrified"".

Scott McGregor, 34, wildly swung a blade at PC Thomas Blair at the property in the city's Lambhill in October 2022. The officer and colleagues used pepper spray and a baton in an attempt to stop him. PC Blair suffered a minor hand injury before McGregor was tackled to the ground and handcuffed. The serial criminal had been due to stand trial at the High Court in Glasgow, but instead pleaded guilty to attempted murder. McGregor also admitted assaulting the two other officers, one of whom quit Police Scotland after the incident. Judge Douglas Brown told McGregor he had been ""completely indifferent"" to whether PC Blair lived or died. Officers had been called after it emerged McGregor's partner wanted him out of their flat. PC Blair, PC Daniel Hilditch and PC Magda Hawkins turned up and initially spotted the couple on the balcony. Prosecutor David Dickson said: ""Once they entered the hall, the front door closed and McGregor exited the bathroom with a knife in his right hand."" McGregor first lunged with the large kitchen knife at PC Hawkins, who used her baton to try and keep him away. He also swiped at PC Hilditch, but the court heard PC Blair was mainly the ""subject of McGregor's ire"". Mr Dickson said: ""He repeatedly attempted to strike him on the body and accepts now he was wickedly reckless in doing that."" The court was told that McGregor was on four bail orders at the time and facing a number of charges, including earlier assaults on police. He had previous convictions for violence, offensive weapons and disorder. The court also heard he was jailed for 18 months in November 2022. Judge Brown said the jail-term would have been 13 years, but for the late guilty plea. He told McGregor: ""Police officers, because of the nature of their duties, often have to go into situations where they are at risk of violence. ""The courts have to do what they can to protect them by imposing sentences that make it clear an assault of an officer is completely unacceptable.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67907644,How the Horizon Post Office scandal has affected Scotland,The Post Office Horizon scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history.,2024-01-10,"The Post Office Horizon scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. People running post offices were accused of crimes like theft, false accounting or embezzlement on the basis of a faulty IT system called Horizon. Some were convicted and sent to prison, others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Their plight has been highlighted in a new ITV drama called Mr Bates vs The Post Office. We don't know the exact number. In Scotland the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service holds sole responsibility for prosecutions. That's different to England where the Post Office prosecuted cases. In 2020 the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - which investigates possible miscarriages of justice - wrote to 73 potential victims of the Horizon scandal in Scotland. As of December 2023 only 16 people had come forward in Scotland to ask for their convictions to be reviewed. That number may rise in the coming days and weeks given the renewed publicity around the Horizon scandal. In November 2022 the SCCRC gave six people permission to appeal Horizon convictions in court. Of those initial six cases only two convictions have so far been overturned. The other four are still waiting for an outcome. In the UK as a whole 93 convictions have been quashed. It is possible there are hundreds of people across Scotland who were accused of stealing money from their post office branches who weren't convicted. A UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal is ongoing and in 2022 it came to Glasgow to hear evidence from affected sub-postmasters and mistresses in Scotland. None of those giving evidence had been convicted but they described the desperation they felt when their accounts repeatedly showed shortfalls. They talked about the dire impact being accused of stealing had on their reputations, finances and mental health. Some people who were accused but not convicted have received compensation: others are still waiting. We know that some sub-postmasters and mistresses died before the extent of the Horizon scandal was uncovered. People whose Horizon convictions are overturned are entitled to apply for £600,000 compensation. How the convictions are quashed is the subject of debate in Scotland and the UK. The UK government could ""pardon"" wrongly convicted postmasters and sub-postmasters, but that would not eliminate the original criminal conviction. This recognises an injustice has occurred, but does not exonerate them from criminal activity. A reversal or ""quashing"" of the conviction is an admission that no criminality took place. That is normally a time-consuming process but emergency laws could see victims have their names cleared this year. Under current Scots and UK law, victims of miscarriages of justice are only eligible for compensation if their conviction is reversed by an appeal court. This means each of about 80 suspected cases in Scotland would have to be heard individually. However, victims must apply for compensation within two years of being pardoned or having their conviction reversed in order to get it. In a letter to the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board in October 2023 the Crown Office said Scotland was ""very much closer to the start of its journey"" in addressing potential miscarriages of justice related to Horizon compared to other parts of the UK. The next court hearing in Scotland is on Friday. It is possible two more convictions will be overturned then because the Crown Office has indicated it won't oppose two of the cases. Once the initial six appeals have concluded the Crown Office said it anticipated that ""a streamlined and expedient process of review, appeal and disposal"" will be available for future cases. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from prosecutions in England. Police Scotland has said it isn't currently investigating but ""is liaising with other UK law enforcement partners and any information received will be assessed."" Hours after the UK government announced emergency laws to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"", First Minister Humza Yousaf confirmed victims in Scotland would also be cleared. Mr Yousaf said those affected by the scandal had waited too long for justice. The legislation, announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, would not normally affect Scotland, but Mr Yousaf said he was open to using a Legislative Consent Motion that would allow it to also apply north of the border. Mr Yousaf added that those affected ""can be absolutely assured"" they will be pardoned.

Dargavel primary school in Bishopton opened in 2022 with a capacity of 548 but forecasts suggest 1,100 spaces will be required in the next decade. The council has apologised for the miscalculations. An Audit Scotland report said the consequences of the error will be felt for some time. A document has been prepared by the controller of audit on the debacle, which has engulfed the local authority since November 2022. It will be considered by the Accounts Commission on Thursday. The paper focuses on the council's response to last year's damning investigation by David Bowles, a former chief executive of four councils. It exposed the ""gross incompetence"" behind the errors and made a series of recommendations. The report states the council has developed an action plan setting out its response to the issues identified. It concluded: ""The council faces a significant challenge to rebuild trust and confidence with the affected local communities and must take steps to assess the effectiveness of its community engagement programme. ""The council's appointed auditors will continue to monitor and report on progress in addressing the recommendations contained within the Bowles report through the annual audit process."" It said steps had been taken to respond to the recommendations of the independent report but there was still more to be done. The report added: ""Both the community and council will be dealing with the consequences of this error for some time."" It also said the local authority should have explained its process ""more clearly and transparently"" when finalising the decision to expand Park Mains High School in Erskine to a 2,000 capacity. Councillor James MacLaren, a Conservative representative for Bishopton, was pleased to see the matter would be discussed by the Accounts Commission. He said: ""I welcome the Accounts Commission's involvement in this. It's a case of the more eyes on it, the better. Mr MacLaren reiterated concerns that the planned extension at Park Mains - which currently has a 1,600 capacity - was not sufficient.

""There will be more uproar in the community. Their voices have been totally ignored."" The commission will consider the controller of audit's report and decide how it wants to proceed. A council spokesperson said: ""Our projections for Park Mains have been reviewed by external experts, based on their tried-and-tested modelling for large housing developments used across the UK. ""These suggest a 400-pupil extension to the existing school will provide enough permanent capacity to meet expected future demand.

Although it has been public knowledge for years with an inquiry ongoing, the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. The first minister was speaking after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced plans to introduce a new law that will quash convictions in England and Wales.

However while in England the Post Office acted as prosecutor, in Scotland all cases were the responsibility of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).

The couple eventually lost the sub-post office - and their shop where it was based - due to the claims. Ms Dar ""won't hold her breath"" regarding future compensation but she hopes the Scottish government will now support those affected. She added: ""The criminal convictions to be quashed, that's amazing work, but for everybody compensation needs to happen."" Myra Philp and her mother Mary ran a post office branch in Auchtermuchty, Fife. In 2007 Mary Philp was suspended over missing funds, but due to her age she was not prosecuted. She died in 2018, before the first case was overturned, and her daughter stated that she has only been offered a ""derisory"" amount of compensation since then. Myra Philp told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live: ""Today's decision is amazingly wonderful, but I haven't heard about the people who weren't convicted, and there were about 3,000 of them. ""We lost everything. We lost the premises. We lost our reputation. We lost our investment. We lost the earnings we would have had going forward. ""Emotionally, it was like a virtual prison sentence except without having your day in court."" Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Angela Constance has said she will speak with fellow ministers about the Scottish government's ongoing Fujitsu contracts. The Japanese company signed a deal in 2020 to support electronic vote counts for Scotland's local elections. The UK government has said Fujitsu - which has apologised for its role in the post office scandal - would be ""held accountable"" if it was found to have blundered in its handling of the affair. Fujitsu's website says the company has over 200 staff located in Scotland, and lists its customers as including the Scottish government and UK government departments based in Scotland.","['Scottish government', 'Humza Yousaf', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A601/production/_130879424_postoffice.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F379/production/_131592326_humza-pa.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FC67/production/_123251646_maryp.jpg']",,UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67907644,How the Horizon Post Office scandal has affected Scotland,The Post Office Horizon scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history.,2024-01-10,"The Post Office Horizon scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. People running post offices were accused of crimes like theft, false accounting or embezzlement on the basis of a faulty IT system called Horizon. Some were convicted and sent to prison, others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Their plight has been highlighted in a new ITV drama called Mr Bates vs The Post Office. We don't know the exact number. In Scotland the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service holds sole responsibility for prosecutions. That's different to England where the Post Office prosecuted cases. In 2020 the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - which investigates possible miscarriages of justice - wrote to 73 potential victims of the Horizon scandal in Scotland. As of December 2023 only 16 people had come forward in Scotland to ask for their convictions to be reviewed. That number may rise in the coming days and weeks given the renewed publicity around the Horizon scandal. In November 2022 the SCCRC gave six people permission to appeal Horizon convictions in court. Of those initial six cases only two convictions have so far been overturned. The other four are still waiting for an outcome. In the UK as a whole 93 convictions have been quashed. It is possible there are hundreds of people across Scotland who were accused of stealing money from their post office branches who weren't convicted. A UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal is ongoing and in 2022 it came to Glasgow to hear evidence from affected sub-postmasters and mistresses in Scotland. None of those giving evidence had been convicted but they described the desperation they felt when their accounts repeatedly showed shortfalls. They talked about the dire impact being accused of stealing had on their reputations, finances and mental health. Some people who were accused but not convicted have received compensation: others are still waiting. We know that some sub-postmasters and mistresses died before the extent of the Horizon scandal was uncovered. People whose Horizon convictions are overturned are entitled to apply for £600,000 compensation. How the convictions are quashed is the subject of debate in Scotland and the UK. The UK government could ""pardon"" wrongly convicted postmasters and sub-postmasters, but that would not eliminate the original criminal conviction. This recognises an injustice has occurred, but does not exonerate them from criminal activity. A reversal or ""quashing"" of the conviction is an admission that no criminality took place. That is normally a time-consuming process but emergency laws could see victims have their names cleared this year. Under current Scots and UK law, victims of miscarriages of justice are only eligible for compensation if their conviction is reversed by an appeal court. This means each of about 80 suspected cases in Scotland would have to be heard individually. However, victims must apply for compensation within two years of being pardoned or having their conviction reversed in order to get it. In a letter to the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board in October 2023 the Crown Office said Scotland was ""very much closer to the start of its journey"" in addressing potential miscarriages of justice related to Horizon compared to other parts of the UK. The next court hearing in Scotland is on Friday. It is possible two more convictions will be overturned then because the Crown Office has indicated it won't oppose two of the cases. Once the initial six appeals have concluded the Crown Office said it anticipated that ""a streamlined and expedient process of review, appeal and disposal"" will be available for future cases. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from prosecutions in England. Police Scotland has said it isn't currently investigating but ""is liaising with other UK law enforcement partners and any information received will be assessed."" Hours after the UK government announced emergency laws to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"", First Minister Humza Yousaf confirmed victims in Scotland would also be cleared. Mr Yousaf said those affected by the scandal had waited too long for justice. The legislation, announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, would not normally affect Scotland, but Mr Yousaf said he was open to using a Legislative Consent Motion that would allow it to also apply north of the border. Mr Yousaf added that those affected ""can be absolutely assured"" they will be pardoned. A Legislative Consent Motion would be the ""easiest and fastest"" solution but he stressed other options were also possible.","['Post offices', 'Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/161B4/production/_129884509_gettyimages-525140033.jpg'],"['By Katie Hunter', 'BBC Scotland reporter']",UK,Scotland

Scott McGregor, 34, wildly swung a blade at PC Thomas Blair at the property in the city's Lambhill in October 2022. The officer and colleagues used pepper spray and a baton in an attempt to stop him. PC Blair suffered a minor hand injury before McGregor was tackled to the ground and handcuffed. The serial criminal had been due to stand trial at the High Court in Glasgow, but instead pleaded guilty to attempted murder. McGregor also admitted assaulting the two other officers, one of whom quit Police Scotland after the incident. Judge Douglas Brown told McGregor he had been ""completely indifferent"" to whether PC Blair lived or died. Officers had been called after it emerged McGregor's partner wanted him out of their flat. PC Blair, PC Daniel Hilditch and PC Magda Hawkins turned up and initially spotted the couple on the balcony. Prosecutor David Dickson said: ""Once they entered the hall, the front door closed and McGregor exited the bathroom with a knife in his right hand."" McGregor first lunged with the large kitchen knife at PC Hawkins, who used her baton to try and keep him away. He also swiped at PC Hilditch, but the court heard PC Blair was mainly the ""subject of McGregor's ire"". Mr Dickson said: ""He repeatedly attempted to strike him on the body and accepts now he was wickedly reckless in doing that."" The court was told that McGregor was on four bail orders at the time and facing a number of charges, including earlier assaults on police. He had previous convictions for violence, offensive weapons and disorder. The court also heard he was jailed for 18 months in November 2022. Judge Brown said the jail-term would have been 13 years, but for the late guilty plea. He told McGregor: ""Police officers, because of the nature of their duties, often have to go into situations where they are at risk of violence. ""The courts have to do what they can to protect them by imposing sentences that make it clear an assault of an officer is completely unacceptable."" McGregor will be supervised for four years on his release.",['Glasgow'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D990/production/_132269655_jacketgetty.jpg'],,UK,Scotland

Dargavel primary school in Bishopton opened in 2022 with a capacity of 548 but forecasts suggest 1,100 spaces will be required in the next decade. The council has apologised for the miscalculations. An Audit Scotland report said the consequences of the error will be felt for some time. A document has been prepared by the controller of audit on the debacle, which has engulfed the local authority since November 2022. It will be considered by the Accounts Commission on Thursday. The paper focuses on the council's response to last year's damning investigation by David Bowles, a former chief executive of four councils. It exposed the ""gross incompetence"" behind the errors and made a series of recommendations. The report states the council has developed an action plan setting out its response to the issues identified. It concluded: ""The council faces a significant challenge to rebuild trust and confidence with the affected local communities and must take steps to assess the effectiveness of its community engagement programme. ""The council's appointed auditors will continue to monitor and report on progress in addressing the recommendations contained within the Bowles report through the annual audit process."" It said steps had been taken to respond to the recommendations of the independent report but there was still more to be done. The report added: ""Both the community and council will be dealing with the consequences of this error for some time."" It also said the local authority should have explained its process ""more clearly and transparently"" when finalising the decision to expand Park Mains High School in Erskine to a 2,000 capacity. Councillor James MacLaren, a Conservative representative for Bishopton, was pleased to see the matter would be discussed by the Accounts Commission. He said: ""I welcome the Accounts Commission's involvement in this. It's a case of the more eyes on it, the better. Mr MacLaren reiterated concerns that the planned extension at Park Mains - which currently has a 1,600 capacity - was not sufficient. He added: ""The problem isn't going away, it's sitting in the background. ""When we find the high school extension isn't big enough to accommodate all the pupils, what will happen then? ""There will be more uproar in the community. Their voices have been totally ignored."" The commission will consider the controller of audit's report and decide how it wants to proceed. A council spokesperson said: ""Our projections for Park Mains have been reviewed by external experts, based on their tried-and-tested modelling for large housing developments used across the UK. ""These suggest a 400-pupil extension to the existing school will provide enough permanent capacity to meet expected future demand.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67932569,Craft beer giant Brewdog abandons real living wage for employees,Craft beer giant Brewdog will no longer pay its employees the real living wage.,2024-01-10,"Craft beer giant Brewdog will no longer pay its employees the real living wage. Workers will receive the UK government's national minimum wage of £11.44 an hour from April - below the £12 cost of living-based rate. The Aberdeenshire-based firm said the move was ""necessary"" as part of an effort to return to profitability after making a £24m operating loss last year. But former staff have accused the company of ""abandoning its principles"" over the move. A letter to employees, seen by BBC Scotland News, said ""hard decisions"" had to be taken in order to maintain financial stability despite a ""bumper"" festive period. Brewdog, founded by James Watt and Martin Dickie, had paid the voluntary wage since 2015. Bryan Simpson, hospitality organiser of Unite, said: ""To withdraw the real living wage now, during the most acute cost of living crisis in a generation is outrageous. ""We are already working with our Brewdog members across the country to collectively challenge this awful decision and force the senior management of the company to do the right thing by the workers who have made them millions."" The real living wage is independently calculated based on living standards in the UK and is separate from the government's national living wage. The rate will increase to £12 an hour outside London and £13.15 for workers in the English capital on 1 April in line with inflation. Brewdog staff over the age of 23 will receive a slight pay rise, but only from £10.90 to £11.44. Those working in London will see no increase from their current rate of £11.95. Blog posts on the brewer's website referencing its status as a living wage employer have been removed. The Punks with Purpose campaign group for ex-workers, set up amid mistreatment allegations in 2021, said: ""The real Living Wage has been a cornerstone of BrewDog's public identity for years. ""This real-terms pay cut for hard-working front line staff proves there is no principle too dearly held for them to abandon and is directly opposed to BrewDog's previous claim that their 'crew are their most important resource' and giving them fair pay for the work they do is one of their 'core beliefs'."" Brewdog's revenue grew to £321.2m in the 2022-23 financial year, but the firm blamed a £24m operating loss on increased production costs for its most popular product, Punk IPA, and rising energy bills at its Ellon plant. Its co-founder, Mr Watt, previously apologised to staff after a BBC Disclosure documentary in 2022 heard claims of inappropriate behaviour A spokesperson for the company said: ""As a result of the changes we're making - and despite unprecedented challenges in the hospitality sector - our staff outside London will be getting a 4.95% increase in base pay, and crew currently working in London will be paid 4.5% above the National Living Wage. ""We have always been fully committed to doing the best we can for our people, and our benefits package is far more generous than the industry average.""","['Scotland business', 'Companies', 'Ellon', 'BrewDog']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5554/production/_125544812_gettyimages-1216607911.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1136B/production/_132270507_jameswatt.png']",,UK,Scotland

It is a miserable situation for the housebuilding firm and its boss Stewart Milne - who was once hailed as a Scottish business success story. Starting out as a young electrician - with a love of football - Milne went on to dominate the construction business in the north east and serve as chairman of Aberdeen FC. The 73-year-old said he was ""devastated"" by the collapse of the company he founded in 1975 and was ""struggling to accept it"". Milne had postponed retirement in an attempt to secure a future for the firm that he poured his working life into. Raised in Alford, Aberdeenshire, he was the youngest of five boys. His father was a farm worker and his mother was an auxiliary nurse. ""It was a tough upbringing,"" Milne said in a 2004 interview with the Sunday Times. ""We lived in a tiny cottage with just three rooms and no electricity until I was 14."" Milne said he had little interest in studying at school but sport was his passion. He trained as an electrician and gained a City & Guilds qualification in 1971. In partnership with a plumber, Milne got his foothold in the industry by renovating flats in Aberdeen. He found he had no shortage of work in the 1970s as the city's tenement housing stock needed extensive modernisation. By 1975 he had set up himself as a housebuilder employing 30 people. His company pioneered rapid timber frame construction that gave them an advantage over his competitors at the time. Milne boasted that his teams could complete jobs in weeks that would take rival firms months. After the oil price slump hit the north east economy in the late-1980s, Milne expanded into central Scotland and it became his biggest area of operation. Stewart Milne Group eventually had offices in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester and a workforce of more than 1,000 people. Milne also became a major shareholder in Aberdeen FC. He joined the Pittodrie club's board of directors in 1994 and became chairman in 1998. He announced he was stepping down as chairman in 2019 but remains on the board. His departure from the club came just weeks after former manager Sir Alex Ferguson opened Cormack Park, a new £12m training facility. Aberdeen FC has confirmed that it has not been affected by the collapse of the Stewart Milne Group. Milne's career was recognised with a CBE for services to construction in 2008. He received honorary doctorates from Robert Gordon University, Napier University and Heriot-Watt University as well as a lifetime achievement award from industry body Homes for Scotland. Jane Wood, chief executive of Homes for Scotland, said she was ""surprised and saddened"" by the company's collapse. Stewart Milne Group was put up for sale in April 2022 after Milne announced his retirement, which he later postponed in a bid to secure the firm's future. He said at the time: ""After considerable soul-searching, I have decided that the time is right to step back from the business I founded to prioritise my time for family, friends and other ventures."" His company was hit hard by the Covid pandemic, which saw construction firms forced to down tools for months. In the year to October 2020 Stewart Milne Group recorded a pre-tax loss of £71.5m on turnover of £269.7m. In December 2021, the firm sold its timber frame business to focus on housebuilding in its core markets in Scotland and north west England. By October 2022 it had recorded annual pre-tax profits of £16.5m. However, turnover fell to £172.4m as its house sales fell by nearly 30% to 583. The initial sale was suspended due to ""economic uncertainty"". It was relisted in July 2023, but failed to attract a viable buyer. It has now entered administration with the immediate loss of more than 200 jobs, with hundreds of other sub-contractors expected to be impacted. Lloyds Banking Group said it had attempted to find a solution that would place the business on a ""sounder financial footing"" and avoid insolvency. Mr Milne said that two bids were made to buy his firm after ""significant interest"", but Lloyds did not accept them and withdrew funding. ""I believe one of the bids could have delivered a comparable, financial return to administration and, crucially, allowed the business to continue to operate, safeguarding hundreds of jobs and protecting livelihoods,"" he added. ""I tried everything I could to find a way to achieve a better outcome for the business and the people who depend on it.""","['Scotland business', 'Construction industry', 'Aberdeen']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/18124/production/_132269589_milne.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10FDC/production/_132269596_stonehaven.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1640/production/_132269650_19605188.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B70/production/_132269653_castlewellan-002.jpg']","['By Paul Hastie', 'BBC Scotland']",UK,Scotland

Katie Allan, 21, was found dead in her cell at Polmont Young Offenders Institute on 4 June 2018. She was convicted in March 2018 after admitting a drink driving offence. The inquiry is looking into whether the deaths of Ms Allan and 16-year-old William Brown, also known as William Lindsay, could have been prevented. Mr Brown took his own life in October 2018, four months after Ms Allan. He had been remanded in custody after being deemed a ""potential risk to public safety"" three days before his death. Polmont prison officer Heather Morrison was allocated as a personal officer to Ms Allan and described her as ""lovely and open"". Ms Morrison told the inquiry at Falkirk Sheriff Court: ""To be honest she was different, and not built for prison. ""A lot of the young women have a background with the secure care system. ""They were already used to the kind of system that's in prison. Katie wasn't. ""She was more mature and more grounded than the other girls."" Ms Morrison also said that she did not know Ms Allan had a history of self-harming when she first met her. When asked if it would have been useful to know this, Ms Morrison said every young person who arrived at the facility was vulnerable and it would not have changed the way she worked with her. Ms Morrison was shown a log of intelligence reports which recorded an incident where Ms Allan had been bullied for tobacco in April, however she said she was not aware of this. And just before she died in June, it was recorded that Ms Allan was receiving abuse and threats from inside the prison. The logs also stated that two inmates from her hall were moved to other prisons after Ms Allan's death due to risk concerns. Ms Morrison said she could not remember if any verbal abuse was directed at Ms Allan, and added that it was ""just part of the culture"" in Polmont. Ms Morrison told the inquiry how Ms Allan had a positive effect on one of the young women in her hall who was a ""difficult individual"". The inquiry also heard how she had denied any thoughts of suicide during a transfer to the young offenders institution, near Falkirk. She was remanded in Cornton Vale women's prison and sent to Polmont to complete her 16-month sentence. Ms Allan took her own life three months later. Alan MacFarlane spoke to Ms Allan when she was transferred. The inquiry previously heard how she had a history of self-harming but this was not noted on the transfer form. The question on the form specifically asks ""if the individual has previously attempted suicide or self-harm or if they currently have any thoughts of suicide or self-harm."" Mr MacFarlane's notes read: ""No concerns noted or voiced. Denies strongly any thoughts of self harm or suicidal intentions."" This was recorded on documents which could be seen by prison officers as they did not have access to health records. He told the inquiry that he would observe a person's presentation, demeanour, eye contact, tone and speech during these meetings. The inquiry previously heard how Ms Allan was found to have traces of an antidepressant which was not prescribed to her during a post-mortem examination. At a family visit the day before she died, her mother had told prison officers Ms Allan was being ""berated"" by other prisoners and was ""terrified"". The inquiry continues.","['Polmont', 'Suicide prevention', 'Prisons']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5B52/production/_121887332_mediaitem120543963.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12E8/production/_90804840_7fb952c2-6523-4a24-a0c3-3a19f26f46b7.jpg']",,UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67935857,Complaint lodged against new Police Scotland chief,"The most senior civilian member of the executive team at Police Scotland has lodged a grievance against the force's new Chief Constable, Jo Farrell.",2024-01-10,"The most senior civilian member of the executive team at Police Scotland has lodged a grievance against the force's new Chief Constable, Jo Farrell. David Page is the deputy chief officer at Police Scotland, with responsibility for corporate support. It is understood he made the complaint against the chief constable within weeks of her arrival last October and is currently on sick leave. Mr Page worked in the financial sector before joining the force in 2016. His complaint against Ms Farrell is being dealt with by the Scottish Police Authority (SPA), the body which oversees and governs the force. The SPA has not yet either upheld or dismissed the complaint, and has refused to comment. Mr Page began his career with the Army and spent 10 years in military intelligence before working in Scotland's financial sector for businesses including Standard Life and the Royal Bank of Scotland. When he joined Police Scotland as its deputy chief officer in 2016, he became its most senior civilian member of staff, in charge of areas including finance and people and development. Last year he played a prominent public role when the force was arguing for its budget to be increased. Ms Farrell joined from Durham Constabulary, which she had led since 2019. She was previously assistant chief constable at Northumbria Police. She is the first woman to lead Police Scotland. In November she apologised for an ""error of judgement"" after it emerged that a police officer drove her home to England when her train was cancelled. She was driven about 120 miles from Edinburgh to Northumberland during Storm Babet on 20 October. She had started in the role of Scotland's top police officer just 11 days earlier. It was reported that she was accompanied by the chief finance officer for Durham Constabulary, Gary Ridley. A Durham Constabulary spokesman confirmed that ""an experienced member of staff attended Police Scotland to advise the chief constable about finances and resources"". Police Scotland said the passenger was dropped off a further 15 miles south in Gateshead, Tyneside. While Jo Farrell is having a very bumpy start in her new role, no-one is suggesting her job is under threat. Any outsider taking charge of such a high-profile organisation is bound to ruffle some feathers and, within the force, Ms Farrell is said to have supporters as well as detractors. Her predecessor, Sir Iain Livingstone, was credited with steadying the ship after the premature departure of Police Scotland's first two chief constables, Sir Stephen House and Phil Gormley. Having appointed Ms Farrell, the SPA will be hoping for a similar period of calm as soon as possible. Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Russell Findlay said Police Scotland had often been accused of lacking transparency. He added: ""All public bodies have a duty to be candid about such important issues and I would urge ministers, Police Scotland and the SPA to come clean about exactly what is going on."" And Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said: ""This grievance must be swiftly resolved so that the senior leadership team are all pulling in the same direction.""",['Police Scotland'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/143BD/production/_107277828_jofarrell.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13EBC/production/_132269518_mediaitem132269517.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1682F/production/_132270229_police_pa.jpg']","['By David Cowan', 'Home affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland']",UK,Scotland

Vinyl, which was formerly known as Club De Mar, became a favourite of clubbers after opening in December 1989. It became Ayrshire's oldest nightclub before closing in 2017. It has operated under the rebranded name of Vinyl for the last six years. Owners say they will now focus their efforts on hosting large-scale events. Under the Club De Mar name, it played host to acts such as the Bay City Rollers, Showaddywaddy and The Drifters. More recently it played host to up-and-coming DJs including Ayr's own Ewan McVicar. The platinum-selling DJ credits his time as a regular DJ in the town's ""legendary clubs"" Club De Mar and Furys as inspiration for a music festival he staged in the town last year. The venue played an important role in Ayrshire's rave scene back in the 90s and early noughties alongside clubs such as Hanger 13 inside the Ayr Pavilion and the Metro in Saltcoats. The club has blamed licensing regulations put in place by the local council for the sudden closure. On Facebook, a spokesperson said: ""We have not made this decision lightly but due to the nature of the statement of licensing policy set out by South Ayrshire Council Licensing Board, and the changing nature of nightlife in the post-Covid era, it has become increasingly difficult to operate as a 'nightclub'."" Current rules mean pubs and bars are permitted to stay open as late as nightclubs. The statement said a decision not to permit ""differential opening times"" between different types of licensed premises has made it ""no longer viable"" to operate a nightclub in the council area. As a event space the venue will work with promoters and artists to host one-off large-scale events, with the first, an evening with DJ Subterra: KIMMIC, due to take place on March 29. The statement of licensing policy approved by councillors in October noted a request to amend the policy to allow a distinct type of license for nightclubs to be introduced but felt the current policy didn't need to be amended. A South Ayrshire Council spokesperson said: ""The licensing board took a decision last autumn to maintain the current licensing policy. A public consultation informed their decision.""","['Nightclubs', 'Ayr']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4520/production/_132269671_picture2.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B7F8/production/_130069074_ew-backtaeayr_background.png']",,UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67932561,Steps to clear Scottish postmasters being considered,The Scottish government is considering its own legislation to clear people who were convicted in Scotland as part of the Post Office Horizon scandal.,2024-01-10,"The Scottish government is considering its own legislation to clear people who were convicted in Scotland as part of the Post Office Horizon scandal. More than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted across the UK, including up to 100 in Scotland, after wrongly being accused of embezzling money. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced a new law that will quash the convictions of all victims of the scandal in England and Wales. But it will not apply in Scotland. Downing Street has said it will work with the Scottish government to ensure sub-postmasters north of the border can also be cleared. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We want to work with relevant bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland on this matter. It is not something we can do cross-UK."" Angela Constance, Scotland's justice secretary, is currently considering how best to clear those who were pursued through the Scottish courts. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland ahead of the prime minister's announcement, she said: ""We recognise that the UK Horizon Post Office scandal as probably one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in our time across the UK. ""We want to play our part in standing up for those who have been impacted by this travesty in Scotland."" Ms Constance has also written to the UK justice secretary, Alex Chalk, seeking an urgent meeting to ensure any Scottish legislation would not have the unintended consequence of excluding sub-postmasters from the UK compensation scheme. At the moment, it appears that the scheme is only accessible to those who are cleared by the appeal courts or were among those who reached a group settlement with the Post Office in 2019. Holyrood has previously passed legislation pardoning gay and bisexual men with historic convictions for same sex relations and pardoning miners for convictions related to strike action in the 1980s. It is possible these laws could offer a model for pardoning sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for fraud and embezzlement in Scotland, if the Scottish and UK governments can agree a way to ensure that does not inadvertently block their route to compensation. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) had sole responsibility for prosecuting Horizon cases in Scotland, with only two convictions having been overturned so far. First Minister Humza Yousaf has previously backed calls for the mass exoneration of victims of the Post Office scandal. Post Office branch managers were accused of wrongdoing based on information from the faulty computer system between 1999 and 2015 The charges included false accounting, theft and fraud. Some of those convicted were jailed, while others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Others have since died. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) wrote to 73 potential victims in Scotland in 2020 but only 16 have come forward to have their convictions quashed. Six people were then given permission by the SCCRC to appeal Horizon convictions in court but only two have been overturned so far. The other four are still awaiting an outcome. Although it has been public knowledge for years with an inquiry ongoing, the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. It has emerged that the COPFS became aware of potential problems with the Horizon system - the faulty Fujitsu software for the Post Office which made it look made look as though money was missing - a decade ago. Ms Constance has said she will speak with fellow ministers about the Scottish government's ongoing Fujitsu contracts. The Japanese company signed a deal in 2020 to support electronic vote counts for Scotland's local elections. The UK government has said Fujitsu - which has apologised for its role in the post office scandal - would be ""held accountable"" if it was found to have blundered in its handling of the affair. Fujitsu's website says the company has over 200 staff located in Scotland, and lists its customers as including the Scottish government and UK government departments based in Scotland.","['Scottish government', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/985F/production/_132270093_23d0f9dfaee0f225624723b62d1e68a69a405f06.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/07A4/production/_132265910_2d5cd85628a98848b322847d2ca7548210b15f38.jpg']",,UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67933971,Hiut Denim jeans worn by Meghan Markle shares secrets,Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle.,2024-01-10,"Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle. That was the Duchess of Sussex's first official royal visit to Wales. Now the Welsh company Hiut Denim has opened its doors to TV cameras to reveal exactly what goes into making its version of the wardrobe staple. The company, founded and run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt in Cardigan, Ceredigion, has been making handmade jeans to order since 2012. It employs 25 people and is currently producing about 10,00 pairs a year. Clare said since the Meghan effect brought the small company 100 miles (106km) west of the Welsh capital to global attention its staff had become used to cameras. Presenter Gregg Wallace was given access to the factory for an episode of BBC 2's Inside the Factory: Jeans. ""When Meghan Markle wore our jeans we had the world's press on our doorstep, so our grand masters [workers], as we call them, have become used to being featured in things... it's good for business,"" added Clare. Cardigan has a long history of jeans making. For almost 40 years the town was home to a factory that made 35,000 pairs of jeans each week for giant UK retailer Marks & Spencer. In 2002 that plant closed with the loss of 400 jobs when production was moved to Morocco to cut costs. Then 10 years later, when the Hieatts were looking to open a factory to start making jeans, they chose Cardigan, employing machinists who had previously worked in the old factory. The company name is a combination of the first two letters of their surname - Hieatt - and the word ""utility"". The reference to its workers as ""grand masters"" acknowledges the fact that some of them have more than 40 years of jeans making experience. New joiners have to train for three years before they can start making jeans for customers. A single pair of jeans from the company can cost from £150 for their cheapest pair up to almost £300 for their most expensive pair. In addition to visiting the Hiut factory, in his BBC2 documentary Gregg Wallace also visited one of Hiut's Italian denim suppliers, Candiani Denim on the outskirts of Milan. There he saw the raw cotton being delivered, plucked, mixed, detangled, spun into yarn, dye and woven before the finished denim was dispatched to clients. Back in the Cardigan factory, the cameras showed the company's pride in its role in returning jeans manufacturing to the area, with ""our town is making jeans again"" emblazoned on the wall. Wallace also witnessed grand master cutter Claudio Belotti creating the 16 denim pieces that make up a pair of the company's jeans, before having a less successful go himself. He then moved into the assembly area where grand master sewer Amanda Humphry began to sew the pieces together with different sewers working on each stage of the 27-stage process. Copper buttons are added at one station, rivets at another, before the product is complete and ready to be sent out to the customer. Was Clare nervous about revealing company secrets? ""No, we're very happy to share how our jeans are made,"" she said. ""The process of how are jeans are made is not unique, it's just the skills and craftsmanship of our team which is unique for us because they've got so much experience and the way that we do it."" Since the programme aired on Tuesday the company has been enjoying another moment in the spotlight, so much so it had to stop selling on their website. ""We've been getting lots of emails and we stayed late in the factory last night answering all the chatbot queries, loads and loads of queries in fact,"" said Clare. ""We've learned previously after the Meghan Markle exposure and we were inundated with orders and people were waiting three or four months for a pair of jeans,"" said Clare. Instead they now release their slots for purchasing jeans in batches. So what are the company's plans for the future? With a more mature workforce, it wants to start a trainee jeans maker programme and is looking to take on two new recruits. ""Most of our makers are over 50 and we're very conscious we need new blood,"" said Clare. ""Hopefully they'll stay with us another 20 years.""

The Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce has compared 33 similarly wealthy nations in a survival league table. Wales ranks 32nd for stomach cancer, 31st for pancreatic and lung, 21st for liver and oesophageal and 12th for brain. The Welsh government said it is committed to improving cancer outcomes. The taskforce - a partnership of cancer charities including Tenovus Cancer Care - suggests Wales and the rest of the UK rank below most other countries for five-year survival rates. South Korea, Belgium, the United States, Australia and China were the countries that scored the highest. The six deadliest cancers are lung, liver, brain, oesophageal, pancreatic and stomach. More than 90,000 people are diagnosed with one of these six in the UK every year, and they account for 67,000 deaths - about half all cancer deaths. The chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, Judi Rhys, said people with these cancers had a ""shockingly low life expectancy"". Ms Rhys, who is also chairwoman of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce Wales subgroup, said: ""The actions we've repeatedly called for - targeted screening and monitoring those most at risk - would have a huge impact on survival. ""These latest statistics should be a strong reminder to Welsh government of the importance of prioritising and accelerating cancer survival initiatives.""

About 15,400 people survive five years in the UK but, if rates were the same as the best performing countries, that could be as many as 23,775 people.

That was the Duchess of Sussex's first official royal visit to Wales. Now the Welsh company Hiut Denim has opened its doors to TV cameras to reveal exactly what goes into making its version of the wardrobe staple. The company, founded and run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt in Cardigan, Ceredigion, has been making handmade jeans to order since 2012. It employs 25 people and is currently producing about 10,00 pairs a year. Clare said since the Meghan effect brought the small company 100 miles (106km) west of the Welsh capital to global attention its staff had become used to cameras. Presenter Gregg Wallace was given access to the factory for an episode of BBC 2's Inside the Factory: Jeans. ""When Meghan Markle wore our jeans we had the world's press on our doorstep, so our grand masters [workers], as we call them, have become used to being featured in things... it's good for business,"" added Clare. Cardigan has a long history of jeans making. For almost 40 years the town was home to a factory that made 35,000 pairs of jeans each week for giant UK retailer Marks & Spencer. In 2002 that plant closed with the loss of 400 jobs when production was moved to Morocco to cut costs. Then 10 years later, when the Hieatts were looking to open a factory to start making jeans, they chose Cardigan, employing machinists who had previously worked in the old factory. The company name is a combination of the first two letters of their surname - Hieatt - and the word ""utility"". The reference to its workers as ""grand masters"" acknowledges the fact that some of them have more than 40 years of jeans making experience. New joiners have to train for three years before they can start making jeans for customers. A single pair of jeans from the company can cost from £150 for their cheapest pair up to almost £300 for their most expensive pair. In addition to visiting the Hiut factory, in his BBC2 documentary Gregg Wallace also visited one of Hiut's Italian denim suppliers, Candiani Denim on the outskirts of Milan. There he saw the raw cotton being delivered, plucked, mixed, detangled, spun into yarn, dye and woven before the finished denim was dispatched to clients. Back in the Cardigan factory, the cameras showed the company's pride in its role in returning jeans manufacturing to the area, with ""our town is making jeans again"" emblazoned on the wall. Wallace also witnessed grand master cutter Claudio Belotti creating the 16 denim pieces that make up a pair of the company's jeans, before having a less successful go himself. He then moved into the assembly area where grand master sewer Amanda Humphry began to sew the pieces together with different sewers working on each stage of the 27-stage process. Copper buttons are added at one station, rivets at another, before the product is complete and ready to be sent out to the customer. Was Clare nervous about revealing company secrets? ""No, we're very happy to share how our jeans are made,"" she said. ""The process of how are jeans are made is not unique, it's just the skills and craftsmanship of our team which is unique for us because they've got so much experience and the way that we do it."" Since the programme aired on Tuesday the company has been enjoying another moment in the spotlight, so much so it had to stop selling on their website. ""We've been getting lots of emails and we stayed late in the factory last night answering all the chatbot queries, loads and loads of queries in fact,"" said Clare. ""We've learned previously after the Meghan Markle exposure and we were inundated with orders and people were waiting three or four months for a pair of jeans,"" said Clare. Instead they now release their slots for purchasing jeans in batches. So what are the company's plans for the future? With a more mature workforce, it wants to start a trainee jeans maker programme and is looking to take on two new recruits. ""Most of our makers are over 50 and we're very conscious we need new blood,"" said Clare. ""Hopefully they'll stay with us another 20 years.""

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokeswoman said on Wednesday it would be ""common sense"" to honour him after a mass quashing of convictions was announced. Mr Bates is said have refused an OBE while ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells still held a CBE. She received that in 2019, in spite of the scandal. MPs and campaigners have called for Mr Bates' honour to be re-submitted now Ms Vennells has agreed to relinquish her's in the face of a public outcry. There have also been a number of online petitions calling for Mr Bates, from Llandudno, Conwy, to be honoured, one of which has more than 80,000 signatures. The scandal has been brought to the fore by ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. It lasted from 1999 and 2015 and saw 736 sub-postmasters unfairly prosecuted due to a faulty IT system Senior minister Esther McVey said she wanted to see Mr Bates knighted ""as soon as possible"". ""Anybody can nominate him and I'm quite sure we will see Sir Alan as soon as possible,"" the Tory MP told GB News. The prime minister's press secretary argued it was ""hard to think of someone more deserving of being rewarded through the honours system than him"". Asked if she agreed with Ms McVey about the knighthood the official said: ""That sounds like common sense."" But Mr Bates told BBC Radio 4's World at One it was ""not about me"". ""It's about the whole group, and it's about getting this money out to people as soon as possible, so they can try and get on with their lives and try and put this behind them,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also backed the move. His spokesman said: ""Alan Bates clearly has emerged as a hero throughout this for the way in which he has led the campaign, the fortitude and resolve he was shown given everything that has been thrown at him throughout this process. ""Obviously honours have their own independent process, but I'm sure that is something the public would regard as entirely appropriate and we would support."" Meanwhile, a former sub-postmaster jailed in the Post Office scandal says he is not convinced by Rishi Sunak's latest plan. Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey, was locked up for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. Upon hearing that new legislation is to be rushed in to quash convictions he said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"". He added he has been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Plaid Cymru has called for a review of any contracts held by the Welsh government with Fujitsu - the Japanese company whose system was at the heart of the scandal.","['Wales', 'Llandudno', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/240A/production/_132162290_mediaitem132162289.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C04A/production/_132162294_tobyjones.jpg']","['By James McCarthy', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

Transport minister Lee Waters said Phil Jones, who chaired a task force on 20mph and whose company advised on the legislation, is leading the exercise. Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh government of marking its own homework. The Welsh government said Mr Jones is ""well-placed to assess whether clarifications... are needed"". It said the review will look at the implementation of the policy, rather than the policy itself. Plaid Cymru said the review should be independent of those who played any part in the legislation. The exercise is expected to look at how councils draw up 30mph exceptions to the limit. The Welsh government has said for months it would hold a review, which has been backed by the two ministers running to replace Mark Drakeford - Vaughan Gething and Jeremy Miles. In the Senedd on Wednesday afternoon Mr Waters said: ""I've asked Phil Jones, who's leading the review for us, to consider whether further tweaks to the guidance on exceptions would be helpful, for example, by explicitly including major bus routes as one of the local criteria they can consider."" Mr Jones led a task force group formed by Mr Waters in 2019, which said a default 20mph speed limit should be introduced ""as quickly as possible"". It made recommendations about how Welsh ministers should introduce the law, which came into effect last September. A Freedom of Information Act request said that Phil Jones Associates, his company, was engaged by Welsh government to offer advice on the legislation. After the Senedd voted, in July 2020, in favour of a national default 20mph speed limit, Mr Jones issued a press release saying he was ""naturally delighted"". ""A 20mph speed limit will mean safer streets and will also encourage more walking and cycling for everyday journeys - which is especially important during the Covid-19 pandemic where people are being discouraged from using public transport,"" he said. On Monday the first minister Mr Drakeford accepted that the policy needed to be fine-tuned because of inconsistencies in approach between different councils. Mr Waters has said that the proportion of roads still at 30mph varied greatly between councils - ""from over 10% in Swansea and Bridgend, to under one per cent in four north Wales authorities."" Natasha Asghar, Conservative shadow transport minister, said: ""The Welsh government is marking its own homework on the hugely unpopular 20mph speed limit. ""Surely the same people who recommended the Welsh government should implement this policy should not be leading the review into it, as it will hardly be impartial and a true reflection of reality."" A Plaid Cymru spokesman said: ""This appointment will no doubt be seen by many as Welsh government wanting to play judge and jury. For its own credibility the review should be independent of those who played any part with the legislation."" ""We need detail about how this review will be conducted, and how it intends to ensure that the further necessary exemptions are implemented promptly."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This review, as we set out in October, is looking at how the new default 20mph speed limit has been implemented across Wales. It is not a review into the policy itself which has been overwhelmingly supported by Senedd members from three parties. ""As Phil Jones - a highly regarded transport planner and engineer - chaired the Welsh 20mph task force group, he is well-placed to assess whether clarifications in the policy are needed to encourage greater consistency.""","['Wales', 'Lee Waters', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16A3D/production/_125833729_20signcaldy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1639D/production/_132273019_mediaitem132273018.jpg']","['By David Deans & Gareth Lewis', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Wales

That was the Duchess of Sussex's first official royal visit to Wales. Now the Welsh company Hiut Denim has opened its doors to TV cameras to reveal exactly what goes into making its version of the wardrobe staple. The company, founded and run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt in Cardigan, Ceredigion, has been making handmade jeans to order since 2012. It employs 25 people and is currently producing about 10,00 pairs a year. Clare said since the Meghan effect brought the small company 100 miles (106km) west of the Welsh capital to global attention its staff had become used to cameras. Presenter Gregg Wallace was given access to the factory for an episode of BBC 2's Inside the Factory: Jeans.

Millie-Rae, 11, has been home-educated by her mum Seana-lee in Merthyr Tydfil, since September. She is one of 5,330 children in Wales not being taught in school - the highest number on record. The Welsh government said it recognised the right of parents to teach their own children, but, in most cases, children were best served by attending school. Seana-lee originally took Millie-Rae out of school during the pandemic as she felt he daughter was not being provided with enough work. But within a few months of returning, she fell behind as she was struggling with the school environment, her mother said. When Millie-Rae began secondary school in September, she lasted just five days before refusing to go. Seana-lee said: ""Her confidence was slipping and she was starting not to go out with friends. She was getting tearful and stressed about not wanting to go back in. ""Her whole behaviour is totally different when she's in school."" Millie-Rae has recently been referred by a GP for ADHD investigations and struggled concentrating in a large, loud classroom. Seana-lee said: ""She lives in a daydream, which can be frustrating sometimes. She's very ditsy but also very clever. School didn't suit her as she needs that one-to-one attention. ""Home is a safe environment for her - she can fidget all she likes and as long as she's learning then I'm happy."" Seana-lee said she was nervous to homeschool Millie-Rae because her family were against it. ""You have to have thick skin to do this, it's not been easy,"" she said. ""Homeschooling has definitely brought her out of her shell and has given her the confidence I think she needed."" Millie-Rae said although she misses seeing her friends regularly, she goes to a weekly drama group to keep up her social life. ""Homeschooling is helping me to live and be happy. Finally, my mental health and my anxiety feels calmer,"" she said. Latest figures show that, from September 2022 to August 2023, 5,330 children were registered as being homeschooled in Wales, compared to 2,626 five years ago. There were fewer than 900 children identified as having their education at home a decade ago. Of the 22 councils in Wales, 17 have seen an increase with Carmarthenshire the highest - up from 457 two years before to 739. Figures may be inflated due to greater attempts from councils to find and record families who have opted against school. Victoria Williams, director of Smart Education Wales, a tuition centre based in Bridgend and Newport, said Covid was one of the main reasons behind the rise. ""Many are now suffering with mental health issues and social anxiety. They are struggling to fit back into society,"" she said. ""Children are also behind educationally and I think a lot of parents enjoyed the lockdowns and realised that they had the ability to educate their children themselves."" A Welsh government spokesman said about 1% of children in Wales were educated this way. ""The home educator's handbook provides advice to parents and carers who are home educating, or considering doing so,"" they added. ""We have also worked with every local authority to make sure that the most appropriate provision can be identified and put in place for each child.""","['Anxiety', 'Wales', 'Merthyr Tydfil', 'Mental health', 'Welsh government', 'Home education', 'Homeschooling']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D093/production/_132259335_mediaitem132086729.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/183D6/production/_132268299_homeschoolfamily.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135B6/production/_132268297_millieraeschool.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E885/production/_132252595_mediaitem132252590.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/C175/production/_132252594_mediaitem132252593.jpg']","['By Eleri Griffiths', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

It included a cut of £16.1m to the childcare offer which provides 30-hours of care a week for three and four-year-olds. The government said the money was available after updated forecasts of demand from parents. Another £11.2m will be taken out of the policy next year, again based on the latest forecasts, with the government saying it will have ""no anticipated direct impact to delivery"". But Jessica Laimann of WEN said the reduced demand was ""most likely a mismatch between what families need and what is actually available"". ""Cutting the budget is certainly the wrong reaction to that,"" she told the Senedd's finance committee. Research by Oxfam Cymru last year showed a ""critical need for affordable childcare in Wales"", she said. She added: ""High childcare costs are compounding the financial pressures for families, pushing parents - especially single mothers - into debt and poverty."" She also said women were more likely to work in and rely on care services. ""So if we are still seeing cuts to these provisions women are likely to bear the brunt of that."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The childcare offer is a demand-led programme and support is made available for all eligible parents that apply. ""We have prioritised communications across Wales to increase awareness and encourage take-up among eligible parents, and we will continue with this in 2024-25.""","['Wales', 'Childcare', 'Welsh government']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1363B/production/_128991497_gettyimages-494678785.jpg'],"['By Daniel Davies', 'BBC Wales political correspondent']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67933785,"Scandal-hit S4C needs new chair, say Welsh MPs","The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said.",2024-01-10,"The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said. MPs on the Welsh Affairs Committee said they were ""concerned"" by evidence given by the organisation's current chairman Rhodri Williams, on Wednesday. They accused the channel's board of an ""absence of cultural leadership"". Mr Williams' term ends on 1 April - it is up to UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to reinstate him, or appoint his replacement. Committee chairman Stephen Crabb told BBC Wales that Mr Williams should not be reappointed in April, rather than immediately replaced. S4C has been in turmoil after a string of bullying allegations and the sacking of two officers, including the chief executive. Both have denied accusations made of them. In committee on Wednesday, Mr Crabb accused Mr Williams of acting as ""judge, jury and executioner"" in his actions last autumn. The MP was speaking in relation to S4C chief executive Sian Doyle, who was sacked in November after bullying allegations which she denies were investigated by a law firm. Mr Williams clarified that the decision to dismiss Ms Doyle was made by S4C's board, but said he had personally sacked Llinos Griffin-Williams, a decision ratified by the board later. Former chief content officer Ms Griffin-Williams had allegedly criticising ex-Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips's Welsh language skills in Nantes during the Rugby World Cup. She denies this and has threatened legal action against S4C. Mr Williams defended his actions to MPs, saying they were in ""the best interest of the staff"", and that he would be ""very happy"" to continue for a second term as chair. In a letter to Ms Frazer, committee chairman and Conservative MP Stephen Crabb says: ""We are concerned at the approach Mr Williams and the board took in seeking advice and reaching assurance in relation to key decisions it made. Mr Crabb added that the committee was ""not satisfied by the assurances from Mr Williams"" and lead non-executive board member Chris Jones ""that the different complaints made against specific individuals had been handled equitably and with proper consideration of the fair treatment of all those involved"". He said the committee was ""concerned about the ability of the current leadership to oversee the changes required"". ""Given the importance of S4C and the scale of the challenges with respect to improving governance and culture within the organisation, we recommend that the government appoint a new chair to take this work forward,"" Mr Crabb added. At the committee session, Mr Williams said that the board had ""acted effectively and quickly"" once they were aware of the problem at the channel and put in place a process which ""gave safety and security"" to staff who wanted to speak up. Capital Law was commissioned to hold an investigation after a letter from the Bectu union claimed there was a ""culture of fear"" among staff. In the Cardiff law firm's report, participants said that Ms Doyle's leadership style was ""dictatorial, creating a culture of fear"". Mr Williams told the MPs that the report provided a ""damning indictment of the leadership culture"" over the last two years, which he claimed ""got even worse"" once the investigation was underway. ""Capital Law makes it very clear where responsibility for that lies, I don't think it is with me or the board,"" he said. The report, Mr Williams said, makes clear that the chief executive, Ms Doyle, acted in a ""confrontational, inconsiderate and abusive manner, and that is where the failure has been"". As a result, he says, the non-executive members of the board ""acted decisively and quickly to terminate the chief executive's employment"". ""I am confident that it was the right decision, and that we have done the best in the interest of the staff of S4C and also in the interest of the organisation as a whole,"" he added. Mr Crabb questioned whether the two senior leaders were treated fairly, compared to complaints made against the chair Mr Williams. Mr Jones said the accusations were ""of a very different nature and very different circumstances"" and that he believed that all cases have been dealt with in an ""appropriate manner"". Discussing the dismissal of Ms Griffin-Williams, Mr Williams said her actions ""created immediate detrimental effect to the reputation of S4C"" and that he had no doubt that what happened constituted ""gross misconduct"". Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake also raised concerns that neither Ms Doyle or Ms Griffin-Williams had received advance sight of the Capital Law report, despite being criticised in it. Although S4C has been without a permanent chief executive since November, chairman Rhodri Williams confirmed that the process to find a replacement for Sian Doyle had not started. He said there was ""no timeline for recruitment"", but that ""sooner rather than later would be best"". Mr Williams became S4C's chairman in 2020. Asked, by Mr Crabb, if it might be better for the channel to ""move on with new leadership"" in the role, Mr Williams replied: ""That's certainly not what I'm told by members of staff or by members of the production community."" The decision on whether he will be offered a second term was a matter for the culture secretary, he told the committee. Ms Doyle has said she does not ""recognise or accept the allegations made"" about her time at the Welsh language broadcaster.","['Wales', 'S4C', 'Welsh language', 'Stephen Crabb', 'Lucy Frazer']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C7A/production/_114922967_20201014_rhodri_williams_9758.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/462E/production/_132266971_mediaitem129577093.jpg']","['By Elliw Gwawr, Adrian Browne and David Deans', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Wales

A maths teacher at Pencoedtre High School in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said a decline in pupil behaviour left staff with ""no choice"" . NASUWT said six schools in Wales are now in disputes over classroom safety. The Vale of Glamorgan council said it was taking steps to ""improve the working environment"". ""We've seen a decline in pupil behaviour, especially truancy in classes, and physical and verbal abuse of teachers,"" said teacher Mark Adams, a NASUWT representative. ""My members are at risk, and we've decided enough is enough."" Mr Adams said nothing had come out of eight months of negotiations with school leaders on the issue. ""They don't seem to be taking the matter seriously,"" he said, and that abuse was adding to the strain on staff in a profession that is already becoming increasingly difficult. ""It's affecting the learning of the children, but also the physical and mental health of teachers at the school,"" he added. ""We've got a number of teachers off at present on work-related stress, and we'd rather get them back in the classroom. ""Long term we'll lose teachers, good teachers from this industry."" Strike action by staff affiliated to the NASUWT union meant Pencoedtre High School was closed to the majority of pupils on Wednesday, with another five days of strike action planned. NASUWT's national officer in Wales, Neil Butler, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that ""gangs of learners"" have been ""roaming the corridors"" of the school. ""They've got a serious internal truancy problem,"" he said, and that verbal abuse had become a daily occurrence in classrooms. ""We're getting to the point where its almost accepted practice in schools and that's got to stop,"" he said. ""Without respect for teachers there can't be learning in classrooms."" ""It's also bad in other schools as well,"" Mr Butler said. ""We've got disputes in six schools across Wales over this issue. ""We don't think employers are taking our health and safety concerns seriously enough and we will be taking action in any school that doesn't protect its teachers."" While assaults on teachers are ""mercifully reasonably rare"", he said they were happening. ""When physical assaults are committed on teachers we expect a robust response from employers such as permanent exclusion and the situation dealt with seriously and we're not seeing that,"" he said. ""We are striking because of our employer's response,"" said Sharron Daly, NASUWT's representative for south east Wales. ""What's happening here isn't different from any other school in Wales - what's different here is the management's response to that behaviour."" Ms Daly said teachers did not feel ""empowered"" by senior management to deal with troublesome behaviour, calling the lack of behaviour policy in the school ""ridiculous"". ""Our members are not supported by management when they try to deal with those incidents of indiscipline."" In a joint statement, the Vale of Glamorgan council and the school said they were ""fully aware of the issues affecting staff and are working with the NASUWT to resolve them. ""The work taking place has been discussed with the trade union in regular meetings and includes steps to improve the working environment and update the school's behaviour policy.""","['Wales', 'NASUWT', 'Teaching', 'Welsh government', 'Wales education', 'Barry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CC8E/production/_132266325_untitled-130.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0D26/production/_132266330_untitled-131.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CC40/production/_130088225_image.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15D20/production/_132267398_untitled-133.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['By Paul Pigott & Iolo Cheung in Barry', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67933971,Hiut Denim jeans worn by Meghan Markle shares secrets,Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle.,2024-01-10,"Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle. That was the Duchess of Sussex's first official royal visit to Wales. Now the Welsh company Hiut Denim has opened its doors to TV cameras to reveal exactly what goes into making its version of the wardrobe staple. The company, founded and run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt in Cardigan, Ceredigion, has been making handmade jeans to order since 2012. It employs 25 people and is currently producing about 10,00 pairs a year. Clare said since the Meghan effect brought the small company 100 miles (106km) west of the Welsh capital to global attention its staff had become used to cameras. Presenter Gregg Wallace was given access to the factory for an episode of BBC 2's Inside the Factory: Jeans. ""When Meghan Markle wore our jeans we had the world's press on our doorstep, so our grand masters [workers], as we call them, have become used to being featured in things... it's good for business,"" added Clare. Cardigan has a long history of jeans making. For almost 40 years the town was home to a factory that made 35,000 pairs of jeans each week for giant UK retailer Marks & Spencer. In 2002 that plant closed with the loss of 400 jobs when production was moved to Morocco to cut costs. Then 10 years later, when the Hieatts were looking to open a factory to start making jeans, they chose Cardigan, employing machinists who had previously worked in the old factory. The company name is a combination of the first two letters of their surname - Hieatt - and the word ""utility"". The reference to its workers as ""grand masters"" acknowledges the fact that some of them have more than 40 years of jeans making experience. New joiners have to train for three years before they can start making jeans for customers. A single pair of jeans from the company can cost from £150 for their cheapest pair up to almost £300 for their most expensive pair. In addition to visiting the Hiut factory, in his BBC2 documentary Gregg Wallace also visited one of Hiut's Italian denim suppliers, Candiani Denim on the outskirts of Milan. There he saw the raw cotton being delivered, plucked, mixed, detangled, spun into yarn, dye and woven before the finished denim was dispatched to clients. Back in the Cardigan factory, the cameras showed the company's pride in its role in returning jeans manufacturing to the area, with ""our town is making jeans again"" emblazoned on the wall. Wallace also witnessed grand master cutter Claudio Belotti creating the 16 denim pieces that make up a pair of the company's jeans, before having a less successful go himself. He then moved into the assembly area where grand master sewer Amanda Humphry began to sew the pieces together with different sewers working on each stage of the 27-stage process. Copper buttons are added at one station, rivets at another, before the product is complete and ready to be sent out to the customer. Was Clare nervous about revealing company secrets? ""No, we're very happy to share how our jeans are made,"" she said. ""The process of how are jeans are made is not unique, it's just the skills and craftsmanship of our team which is unique for us because they've got so much experience and the way that we do it."" Since the programme aired on Tuesday the company has been enjoying another moment in the spotlight, so much so it had to stop selling on their website. ""We've been getting lots of emails and we stayed late in the factory last night answering all the chatbot queries, loads and loads of queries in fact,"" said Clare. ""We've learned previously after the Meghan Markle exposure and we were inundated with orders and people were waiting three or four months for a pair of jeans,"" said Clare. Instead they now release their slots for purchasing jeans in batches. So what are the company's plans for the future? With a more mature workforce, it wants to start a trainee jeans maker programme and is looking to take on two new recruits. ""Most of our makers are over 50 and we're very conscious we need new blood,"" said Clare. ""Hopefully they'll stay with us another 20 years.""

Christopher Kapessa, 13, died after the incident at the River Cynon in Fernhill, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in 2019. Killian Haslam, 18, told the inquest he was one of the children who jumped in to try and save Christopher. Mr Haslam claims another teenager, then 14, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was stood behind Christopher and asked ""Shall I push him?"". Mr Haslam said he remembered Christopher, who was ""joking around with his friends"", taking off his clothes but being unsure whether he wanted to enter the water. ""He was saying he couldn't swim and then he was saying he was a great swimmer,"" he told South Wales Central Coroner's Court in Pontypridd. Mr Haslam added that he did not believe the unnamed teen's pushing comment was made in a serious way. ""It was more a jokey way... I just carried on getting changed, it was freezing, I didn't take much notice,"" he said. Mr Haslam told the court he was getting changed when he heard lots of noise and returned to the river and was then one of the children who jumped in to help Christopher but he could not be saved. The court heard that another teenager remembered Christopher's last words as ""Killian, save me"". Killian Haslam also told the court that, about a week after Christopher's death, he met the teenager who cannot be named in a local park. ""He asked me what I put in my statement and I said I was going off what I heard, that he tripped,"" he said. ""He thanked me and I was taken aback that he was thankful and that's when he told me he pushed him."" The court has heard from other teenagers who said they saw Christopher being pushed into the water. Millie Morgan, 18, told the inquest she also jumped in to help him after she realised he was in trouble. She said his head was ""going in and out"" of the water and that she ""could see he was giving up"". ""I tried to find him but the water was too black and muddy,"" she told the court. ""You couldn't see anything at all underneath the water. ""I looked for him for a while but I couldn't see him, and that's when the police came."" Ms Morgan also told the court that she was with a group of friends who met with the boy who allegedly pushed Christopher, after the incident. ""A couple of weeks after we went to his garage and he said something along the lines of he pushed him, he didn't slip,"" she added.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokeswoman said on Wednesday it would be ""common sense"" to honour him after a mass quashing of convictions was announced. Mr Bates is said have refused an OBE while ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells still held a CBE. She received that in 2019, in spite of the scandal. MPs and campaigners have called for Mr Bates' honour to be re-submitted now Ms Vennells has agreed to relinquish her's in the face of a public outcry. There have also been a number of online petitions calling for Mr Bates, from Llandudno, Conwy, to be honoured, one of which has more than 80,000 signatures. The scandal has been brought to the fore by ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. It lasted from 1999 and 2015 and saw 736 sub-postmasters unfairly prosecuted due to a faulty IT system Senior minister Esther McVey said she wanted to see Mr Bates knighted ""as soon as possible"". ""Anybody can nominate him and I'm quite sure we will see Sir Alan as soon as possible,"" the Tory MP told GB News. The prime minister's press secretary argued it was ""hard to think of someone more deserving of being rewarded through the honours system than him"". Asked if she agreed with Ms McVey about the knighthood the official said: ""That sounds like common sense."" But Mr Bates told BBC Radio 4's World at One it was ""not about me"". ""It's about the whole group, and it's about getting this money out to people as soon as possible, so they can try and get on with their lives and try and put this behind them,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also backed the move. His spokesman said: ""Alan Bates clearly has emerged as a hero throughout this for the way in which he has led the campaign, the fortitude and resolve he was shown given everything that has been thrown at him throughout this process. ""Obviously honours have their own independent process, but I'm sure that is something the public would regard as entirely appropriate and we would support.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67940087,Wales 20mph speed limit adviser to lead review,A transport consultant who told the Welsh government how to implement its default 20mph speed limit has been asked to review how it works.,2024-01-10,"A transport consultant who told the Welsh government how to implement its default 20mph speed limit has been asked to review how it works. Transport minister Lee Waters said Phil Jones, who chaired a task force on 20mph and whose company advised on the legislation, is leading the exercise. Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh government of marking its own homework. The Welsh government said Mr Jones is ""well-placed to assess whether clarifications... are needed"". It said the review will look at the implementation of the policy, rather than the policy itself. Plaid Cymru said the review should be independent of those who played any part in the legislation. The exercise is expected to look at how councils draw up 30mph exceptions to the limit. The Welsh government has said for months it would hold a review, which has been backed by the two ministers running to replace Mark Drakeford - Vaughan Gething and Jeremy Miles. In the Senedd on Wednesday afternoon Mr Waters said: ""I've asked Phil Jones, who's leading the review for us, to consider whether further tweaks to the guidance on exceptions would be helpful, for example, by explicitly including major bus routes as one of the local criteria they can consider."" Mr Jones led a task force group formed by Mr Waters in 2019, which said a default 20mph speed limit should be introduced ""as quickly as possible"". It made recommendations about how Welsh ministers should introduce the law, which came into effect last September. A Freedom of Information Act request said that Phil Jones Associates, his company, was engaged by Welsh government to offer advice on the legislation. After the Senedd voted, in July 2020, in favour of a national default 20mph speed limit, Mr Jones issued a press release saying he was ""naturally delighted"". ""A 20mph speed limit will mean safer streets and will also encourage more walking and cycling for everyday journeys - which is especially important during the Covid-19 pandemic where people are being discouraged from using public transport,"" he said. On Monday the first minister Mr Drakeford accepted that the policy needed to be fine-tuned because of inconsistencies in approach between different councils. Mr Waters has said that the proportion of roads still at 30mph varied greatly between councils - ""from over 10% in Swansea and Bridgend, to under one per cent in four north Wales authorities."" Natasha Asghar, Conservative shadow transport minister, said: ""The Welsh government is marking its own homework on the hugely unpopular 20mph speed limit. ""Surely the same people who recommended the Welsh government should implement this policy should not be leading the review into it, as it will hardly be impartial and a true reflection of reality."" A Plaid Cymru spokesman said: ""This appointment will no doubt be seen by many as Welsh government wanting to play judge and jury. For its own credibility the review should be independent of those who played any part with the legislation."" ""We need detail about how this review will be conducted, and how it intends to ensure that the further necessary exemptions are implemented promptly."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This review, as we set out in October, is looking at how the new default 20mph speed limit has been implemented across Wales. It is not a review into the policy itself which has been overwhelmingly supported by Senedd members from three parties.

The Japanese-owned IT company provided the system at the heart of the Post Office scandal. The party's leader Rhun ap Iorwerth asked whether the company was ""fit"" to have contracts with the government. The Welsh government has been asked to confirm whether a review will take place and how many contracts it holds. Fujitsu has said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Meanwhile Labour MS Jack Sergeant criticised an upfront compensation payment to sub-postmasters of £75,000 as ""not good enough"". In the Senedd on Wednesday Mr ap Iorwerth said he was aware that the Welsh government had had dealings with the company, including a five year support and maintenance contract for Transport for Wales. He asked Deputy Minister Hannah Blythyn for an update on the number of active contracts the Welsh government held with Fujitsu. He added: ""Could the minister tell us how the concerns regarding their [Fujitsu's] involvement in the Horizon scandal were taken into consideration before they were awarded Welsh government contracts? ""What additional due diligence will be applied to the government's relationship with Fujitsu now and in the future as a result of the public understanding of the scale of the scandal that Fujitsu was involved in? ""Are they fit to have contracts with Welsh government: is Welsh government comfortable having contracts with a company at the heart of such a scandal?"" Ms Blythyn said she did not have the number of contracts at her ""fingertips"" but would come back to the Senedd with more detail. Earlier, answering a Topical Question from Mr Sergeant, Ms Blythyn had told MSs that Counsel General Mick Antoniw - the Welsh government's top legal advisor - would shortly be meeting the other UK nations to discuss the miscarriage of justice and the ""fundamental changes needed to ensure the rule of law is more than just a soundbite"". Mr ap Iorwerth also paid tribute to two of his constituents in Ynys Mon - Noel Thomas and Lorraine Williams - who were caught up in the Post Office scandal.","['Wales', 'Welsh government']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1175D/production/_132271517_gettyimages-1238844287.jpg'],"['By Gareth Lewis', 'BBC Wales political editor']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67933785,"Scandal-hit S4C needs new chair, say Welsh MPs","The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said.",2024-01-10,"The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said. MPs on the Welsh Affairs Committee said they were ""concerned"" by evidence given by the organisation's current chairman Rhodri Williams, on Wednesday. They accused the channel's board of an ""absence of cultural leadership"". Mr Williams' term ends on 1 April - it is up to UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to reinstate him, or appoint his replacement. Committee chairman Stephen Crabb told BBC Wales that Mr Williams should not be reappointed in April, rather than immediately replaced. S4C has been in turmoil after a string of bullying allegations and the sacking of two officers, including the chief executive. Both have denied accusations made of them. In committee on Wednesday, Mr Crabb accused Mr Williams of acting as ""judge, jury and executioner"" in his actions last autumn. The MP was speaking in relation to S4C chief executive Sian Doyle, who was sacked in November after bullying allegations which she denies were investigated by a law firm. Mr Williams clarified that the decision to dismiss Ms Doyle was made by S4C's board, but said he had personally sacked Llinos Griffin-Williams, a decision ratified by the board later. Former chief content officer Ms Griffin-Williams had allegedly criticising ex-Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips's Welsh language skills in Nantes during the Rugby World Cup. She denies this and has threatened legal action against S4C. Mr Williams defended his actions to MPs, saying they were in ""the best interest of the staff"", and that he would be ""very happy"" to continue for a second term as chair. In a letter to Ms Frazer, committee chairman and Conservative MP Stephen Crabb says: ""We are concerned at the approach Mr Williams and the board took in seeking advice and reaching assurance in relation to key decisions it made. Mr Crabb added that the committee was ""not satisfied by the assurances from Mr Williams"" and lead non-executive board member Chris Jones ""that the different complaints made against specific individuals had been handled equitably and with proper consideration of the fair treatment of all those involved"". He said the committee was ""concerned about the ability of the current leadership to oversee the changes required"". ""Given the importance of S4C and the scale of the challenges with respect to improving governance and culture within the organisation, we recommend that the government appoint a new chair to take this work forward,"" Mr Crabb added. At the committee session, Mr Williams said that the board had ""acted effectively and quickly"" once they were aware of the problem at the channel and put in place a process which ""gave safety and security"" to staff who wanted to speak up. Capital Law was commissioned to hold an investigation after a letter from the Bectu union claimed there was a ""culture of fear"" among staff. In the Cardiff law firm's report, participants said that Ms Doyle's leadership style was ""dictatorial, creating a culture of fear"". Mr Williams told the MPs that the report provided a ""damning indictment of the leadership culture"" over the last two years, which he claimed ""got even worse"" once the investigation was underway. ""Capital Law makes it very clear where responsibility for that lies, I don't think it is with me or the board,"" he said. The report, Mr Williams said, makes clear that the chief executive, Ms Doyle, acted in a ""confrontational, inconsiderate and abusive manner, and that is where the failure has been"". As a result, he says, the non-executive members of the board ""acted decisively and quickly to terminate the chief executive's employment"". ""I am confident that it was the right decision, and that we have done the best in the interest of the staff of S4C and also in the interest of the organisation as a whole,"" he added. Mr Crabb questioned whether the two senior leaders were treated fairly, compared to complaints made against the chair Mr Williams. Mr Jones said the accusations were ""of a very different nature and very different circumstances"" and that he believed that all cases have been dealt with in an ""appropriate manner"". Discussing the dismissal of Ms Griffin-Williams, Mr Williams said her actions ""created immediate detrimental effect to the reputation of S4C"" and that he had no doubt that what happened constituted ""gross misconduct"". Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake also raised concerns that neither Ms Doyle or Ms Griffin-Williams had received advance sight of the Capital Law report, despite being criticised in it. Although S4C has been without a permanent chief executive since November, chairman Rhodri Williams confirmed that the process to find a replacement for Sian Doyle had not started. He said there was ""no timeline for recruitment"", but that ""sooner rather than later would be best"". Mr Williams became S4C's chairman in 2020. Asked, by Mr Crabb, if it might be better for the channel to ""move on with new leadership"" in the role, Mr Williams replied: ""That's certainly not what I'm told by members of staff or by members of the production community."" The decision on whether he will be offered a second term was a matter for the culture secretary, he told the committee. Ms Doyle has said she does not ""recognise or accept the allegations made"" about her time at the Welsh language broadcaster.","['Wales', 'S4C', 'Welsh language', 'Stephen Crabb', 'Lucy Frazer']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C7A/production/_114922967_20201014_rhodri_williams_9758.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/462E/production/_132266971_mediaitem129577093.jpg']","['By Elliw Gwawr, Adrian Browne and David Deans', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Wales

In England, most students who took exams in November will have been resitting English or maths. Their GCSEs will be graded using a numerical system from 9 to 1. Exams are graded differently in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland has a separate qualifications system to the rest of the UK, with no GCSEs. Senior examiners decide the minimum marks needed for each grade. In England, the summer 2023 grade boundaries were published via the following links for the different exam boards: The main exam board for Wales, WJEC, also published grade boundaries on its website. For those taking GCSEs in Northern Ireland, broad subject grade boundaries were published on the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA) website and the grade boundaries for specific papers were published here. The 9-1 grading scheme was brought in alongside an overhaul of the curriculum in England in 2014. The rollout began in 2017 with three subjects - English language, English literature and maths - being the first to be graded in numbers. By 2020, all subjects were using the new grading system. The highest grade is now 9, while 1 is the lowest. The U grade, meaning ""ungraded"", remains the same. The number scale is not directly equivalent to the old letter one. However, the two scales do meet in certain places: Exams watchdog Ofqual has said fewer grade 9s will have been awarded than A*s ""to identify exceptional performance"". Pupils will have needed a 4 for a ""standard pass"" and 5 for a ""strong pass"". This means that a candidate who gets nine grade-4s has, technically, passed all their exams. However, the government's school league tables are based on the percentage of pupils who achieve a 5 or above in English and maths GCSEs. Many sixth forms insist on a minimum number of 5s or 6s as a condition of entry for further study. The numerical grading scheme was introduced as part of a 2014 curriculum overhaul by then-education secretary, Michael Gove. It put less emphasis on GCSE coursework than before, with grades in almost all subjects decided in final exams. The qualifications were designed to be more challenging, with exams taken after two years of study. Previously pupils covered the syllabus through a series of modules with regular assessments throughout the course. At the time of the changes, the government argued that the new scale ""recognises more clearly the achievements of high-attaining students, as the additional grades allow for greater differentiation"". It also said that the move from letters to numbers would make it clear - for example to an employer - ""whether a student has taken a new, more challenging GCSE, or an old reformed GCSE"". Grades have changed in Northern Ireland too. In summer 2019, the CCEA introduced a new nine-category grade scale - A* to G, including a C*. Students may also get results with grades 9-1 if they take exams set by English boards. The Welsh government introduced new and revised GCSE courses in September 2015. The most significant changes were in English language, Welsh language and mathematics. Wales retained the letter-based grading structure A*- G.","['Exams', 'Wales', 'Young people', 'GCSEs', 'England']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7B05/production/_126039413_gettyimages-838244114.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/86AE/production/_130887443_new_gcse_grading_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/49B5/production/_125996881_6e2e4f7d-c67f-4626-bd44-429287959a41.jpg']",,UK,Wales

Funding for a childcare scheme has been cut by the Welsh government in an attempt to direct more money to frontline public services. The government says demand for care had been lower than expected. But the Women's Equality Network (WEN) charity said it was the ""wrong reaction"". The gender-equality group said the government should instead make sure families can access the service. In October, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans revealed cuts mid-way through the financial year so more funding could be switched to the NHS and rail operator Transport for Wales. It included a cut of £16.1m to the childcare offer which provides 30-hours of care a week for three and four-year-olds. The government said the money was available after updated forecasts of demand from parents. Another £11.2m will be taken out of the policy next year, again based on the latest forecasts, with the government saying it will have ""no anticipated direct impact to delivery"". But Jessica Laimann of WEN said the reduced demand was ""most likely a mismatch between what families need and what is actually available"". ""Cutting the budget is certainly the wrong reaction to that,"" she told the Senedd's finance committee. Research by Oxfam Cymru last year showed a ""critical need for affordable childcare in Wales"", she said. She added: ""High childcare costs are compounding the financial pressures for families, pushing parents - especially single mothers - into debt and poverty."" She also said women were more likely to work in and rely on care services. ""So if we are still seeing cuts to these provisions women are likely to bear the brunt of that."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The childcare offer is a demand-led programme and support is made available for all eligible parents that apply. ""We have prioritised communications across Wales to increase awareness and encourage take-up among eligible parents, and we will continue with this in 2024-25.""","['Wales', 'Childcare', 'Welsh government']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1363B/production/_128991497_gettyimages-494678785.jpg'],"['By Daniel Davies', 'BBC Wales political correspondent']",UK,Wales

Christopher Kapessa, 13, died after the incident at the River Cynon in Fernhill, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in 2019. Killian Haslam, 18, told the inquest he was one of the children who jumped in to try and save Christopher. Mr Haslam claims another teenager, then 14, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was stood behind Christopher and asked ""Shall I push him?"". Mr Haslam said he remembered Christopher, who was ""joking around with his friends"", taking off his clothes but being unsure whether he wanted to enter the water. ""He was saying he couldn't swim and then he was saying he was a great swimmer,"" he told South Wales Central Coroner's Court in Pontypridd. Mr Haslam added that he did not believe the unnamed teen's pushing comment was made in a serious way. ""It was more a jokey way... I just carried on getting changed, it was freezing, I didn't take much notice,"" he said. Mr Haslam told the court he was getting changed when he heard lots of noise and returned to the river and was then one of the children who jumped in to help Christopher but he could not be saved. The court heard that another teenager remembered Christopher's last words as ""Killian, save me"". Killian Haslam also told the court that, about a week after Christopher's death, he met the teenager who cannot be named in a local park. ""He asked me what I put in my statement and I said I was going off what I heard, that he tripped,"" he said. ""He thanked me and I was taken aback that he was thankful and that's when he told me he pushed him."" The court has heard from other teenagers who said they saw Christopher being pushed into the water. Millie Morgan, 18, told the inquest she also jumped in to help him after she realised he was in trouble. She said his head was ""going in and out"" of the water and that she ""could see he was giving up"". ""I tried to find him but the water was too black and muddy,"" she told the court. ""You couldn't see anything at all underneath the water. ""I looked for him for a while but I couldn't see him, and that's when the police came."" Ms Morgan also told the court that she was with a group of friends who met with the boy who allegedly pushed Christopher, after the incident.

A maths teacher at Pencoedtre High School in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said a decline in pupil behaviour left staff with ""no choice"" . NASUWT said six schools in Wales are now in disputes over classroom safety. The Vale of Glamorgan council said it was taking steps to ""improve the working environment"". ""We've seen a decline in pupil behaviour, especially truancy in classes, and physical and verbal abuse of teachers,"" said teacher Mark Adams, a NASUWT representative. ""My members are at risk, and we've decided enough is enough."" Mr Adams said nothing had come out of eight months of negotiations with school leaders on the issue. ""They don't seem to be taking the matter seriously,"" he said, and that abuse was adding to the strain on staff in a profession that is already becoming increasingly difficult. ""It's affecting the learning of the children, but also the physical and mental health of teachers at the school,"" he added. ""We've got a number of teachers off at present on work-related stress, and we'd rather get them back in the classroom. ""Long term we'll lose teachers, good teachers from this industry."" Strike action by staff affiliated to the NASUWT union meant Pencoedtre High School was closed to the majority of pupils on Wednesday, with another five days of strike action planned. NASUWT's national officer in Wales, Neil Butler, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that ""gangs of learners"" have been ""roaming the corridors"" of the school. ""They've got a serious internal truancy problem,"" he said, and that verbal abuse had become a daily occurrence in classrooms. ""We're getting to the point where its almost accepted practice in schools and that's got to stop,"" he said. ""Without respect for teachers there can't be learning in classrooms."" ""It's also bad in other schools as well,"" Mr Butler said. ""We've got disputes in six schools across Wales over this issue. ""We don't think employers are taking our health and safety concerns seriously enough and we will be taking action in any school that doesn't protect its teachers."" While assaults on teachers are ""mercifully reasonably rare"", he said they were happening. ""When physical assaults are committed on teachers we expect a robust response from employers such as permanent exclusion and the situation dealt with seriously and we're not seeing that,"" he said. ""We are striking because of our employer's response,"" said Sharron Daly, NASUWT's representative for south east Wales. ""What's happening here isn't different from any other school in Wales - what's different here is the management's response to that behaviour."" Ms Daly said teachers did not feel ""empowered"" by senior management to deal with troublesome behaviour, calling the lack of behaviour policy in the school ""ridiculous"".

Twenty-one local authorities have already implemented the ban, while Powys council has confirmed it will be joining them. It comes as part of the RSPCA's No Fun At The Fair campaign, which is calling for regulation on events which have historically given animals as rewards. But the charity says an outright Welsh government ban is needed to prevent the practice happening on private land. Sioned Nikolic, RSPCA Cymru's public affairs officer, said: ""Only a few months ago we were calling on 10 local authorities to take action and now we have all councils in agreement that this will not be happening on their land."" But the ban does not mean the practice cannot continue on private land. ""We know that this is something people care about, with many assuming it is already banned,"" she said. ""We would ultimately like to see pets being given away as prizes banned outrightly by the Welsh government."" Since 2020, there have been 42 reports about pets being given as prizes made to the RSPCA, but the charity fears many incidents go unreported. Goldfish are the animal most commonly associated with prize-giving, but the RSPCA says they are easily stressed and very often fish that are won as prizes suffer miserably from shock and oxygen starvation or die prematurely from changes in water temperature. Ms Nikolic added: ""They're misunderstood pets as they can make great companions, but can actually be challenging to look after. New owners must do their research before they acquire the fish, not afterwards. ""Before bringing a fish home for the first time, it's important to set the tank up at least two weeks in advance to make sure it's all running smoothly, and this just isn't possible for someone who's won a fish without being prepared for it.""","['Environment', 'RSPCA', 'Wales', 'Fish', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/863C/production/_125746343_gettyimages-131491177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F4/production/_125746350_gettyimages-88374868.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Catriona Aitken', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

A string of bullying accusations has left the organisation's leadership in turmoil. Jo Stevens and Thangam Debbonaire said that a ""damaging situation"" was continuing ""unchecked"" by the UK government. In response Ms Frazer said she is taking the matter ""very seriously"". In her first public comments on the matter issued late on Tuesday night, the minister said she expects S4C to address issues identified ""as a matter of urgency"". But Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said interference by the UK government by itself ""will not solve issues at S4C"". The chief executive of S4C, Sian Doyle, was sacked late last year ahead of the publication of allegations in a report that she behaved like a dictator - accusations she denied. Her father later blamed S4C and the UK government for his daughter taking an overdose, saying she had been the subject herself of ""constant"" bullying. Chief content officer Llinos Griffin-Williams was also fired after she allegedly told a rugby star that his Welsh skills were not good enough and that she could end his career. The broadcaster's chairman, Rhodri Williams, has also been accused of acting inappropriately by shouting at Ms Griffin-Williams. He was said to have apologised. Ultimate control over broadcasting in Wales lies in London. S4C is overseen by its board, the chair of which is appointed by the UK government. In a joint letter, shadow Welsh secretary Ms Stevens and shadow culture secretary Ms Debbonaire said S4C ""cannot be allowed to flounder any further"". Writing to Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, the frontbenchers wrote: ""Since its inception in 1982, S4C has been an important representation of Welsh society, its people and language."" They said that ""recent efforts to modernise the channel have been overshadowed by a series of crises that suggest deep-rooted problems with the organisation's leadership, management and culture, which should be of real concern to you as the responsible Cabinet Minister."" The MPs said ""questions remain"" about the process that led to the independent report and the sacking of the two senior officers, and whether the S4C board ""and interim leadership can swiftly deliver the fundamental changes which are clearly needed to transform the organisation and its working environment"". ""However, there has been total silence from you and your department as this unfortunate saga has unfolded. ""We are deeply concerned that this is allowing a damaging situation to continue unchecked."" The letter asked if Ms Frazer would consider ""an investigation or rapid review"", and that she would ""begin to take a more active interest in its situation. It comes ahead of Rhodri Williams' evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. A department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS] spokesperson said: ""Complaints relating to members of staff are a matter for S4C, which is independent of the government. ""Now that the results of the investigation by Capital Law have been published, we expect S4C to address the issues identified as a matter of urgency. ""As its sponsor department, DCMS has maintained regular contact with S4C throughout this investigation, as well as giving the allegations and concerns raised careful and appropriate consideration. We will continue to do so."" In a response, Ms Frazer said: ""We take the recent developments at S4C very seriously."" She said officials have been in regular contact with members of S4C's executive team throughout the work by Capital Law, which produced the report on S4C. ""I am concerned with the findings of the report and allegations that have been raised and, as I have made clear several times, I expect S4C to address the issues identified as a matter of urgency."" ""I have not met the chair of S4C but my officials regularly liaise with him."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Labour in Westminster should support the devolution of broadcasting. ""Interference by the UK Government by itself will not solve issues at S4C,"" she said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67933437,"Cardiff: Mice, poo and contaminated food at kebab shop","Mice, rodent droppings and raw meat in contact with cooked food were found at a kebab shop which failed to follow food hygiene advice.",2024-01-10,"Mice, rodent droppings and raw meat in contact with cooked food were found at a kebab shop which failed to follow food hygiene advice. Diar Ali, operator at Andalucia Kebab House on City Road, Cardiff, was handed a six-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, on Tuesday. He must also pay thousands of pounds worth of fines. Ali, 48, of Westland Close, Cardiff, was found guilty of 23 food hygiene-related offences. He was previously jailed for eight months in 2013 after an E. coli outbreak at the same premises - then called The Adonis - which affected nine people including a 12-year-old boy. Cardiff Crown Court heard how rodent droppings were discovered following one of several Shared Regulatory Service (SRS) visits in 2021 and there was evidence of raw meat coming into contact with cooked food. SRS told Ali he should close to address the issues, but he insisted he could resolve them quickly with a deep clean, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Officers revisited the premises in May 2021 and, while some efforts had been made to improve, more offences were discovered. Alexander Greenwood, prosecuting, said on one occasion inspectors witnessed raw chicken juice dripping onto an area where naan bread would be placed and that food was not being refrigerated at correct temperatures. He added there was ""no food safety management on site at all"" and the premises ""wasn't clean and in a general state of disrepair"", with glue having been put on the floor to catch mice. Mr Greenwood said an employee was seen picking up raw lamb and washing their hands in the wrong basin, while a mouse was spotted running under a Coca-Cola drinks machine. Visits in September and November 2021 revealed further offences. Mr Greenwood said there was no evidence of staff training in the Food Standards Agency's Safer Food, Better Business programme. The business was awarded a one out of five food hygiene rating but, in December 2021, further offences were found. The business was later given a three food hygiene rating, but has since closed permanently. Bethan Evans, defending Ali, said the kebab house was owned by a man called Mustafa Said who was only involved with the premises as an interpreter and her client ""regrets ever becoming involved in this shop"". She also told the court that Ali engaged with inspectors when they attended the premises and did make some improvements to the kebab shop, such as a new fridge which was purchased to address temperature control issues. Ms Evans said there was no evidence of illness or harm resulting from these offences and added: ""As a result of these convictions, he will have no further involvement in any food premises. ""He wishes to put this behind him."" But Recorder Andrew Hammond said it was clear that the premises had been kept in an ""appalling"" state and the food hygiene offences created a ""real risk"" to the health of members of the public. He said: ""Offences of this sort are serious. They create a real risk to the health of unsuspecting members of the public of all ages, some of whom may be vulnerable and the potential for widespread harm from food hygiene offences such as this is significant and obvious."" As well as the suspended sentence, Ali must complete 40 days of rehabilitation activity and pay a £1,000 fine, £128 victim surcharge and £2,000 in prosecution costs. A food hygiene order was imposed and he is now prohibited from participating in the management of any food business.","['Wales', 'Cardiff', 'Food']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FC36/production/_132266546_screenshot2024-01-10092539.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/171CA/production/_132266649_screenshot2024-01-10093503.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FC9A/production/_132266646_screenshot2024-01-10092922.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/17F0D/production/_127816089_sounds_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/2365/production/_127816090_sounds_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['By Ted Peskett & Catriona Aitken', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

Legislation is expected to be introduced to the Senedd before the end of the year. The Welsh government said it wanted the new rules to improve visitors' experiences and improve safety. It would do this by ensuring those letting accommodation met a set of standards. It would also mean there was, for the first time, a register of all visitor accommodation available across Wales, including details on who was operating it, where and how. It added that the move followed a public consultation and a survey which found 89% of visitors considered it important the accommodation they stayed in was operating safely. Councils have already been given powers to charge up to a 300% premium on second homes and holiday lets. Many parts of the world have already adopted licensing, certification or registration schemes across their visitor accommodation sectors. Northern Ireland has had a scheme in place since 1992, while Scotland recently introduced a licensing scheme for short-term lets and the UK government is also pursuing a registration approach for short term-lets. Deputy Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism Dawn Bowden said there were concerns about the impact of short-term lets on housing stock in communities.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67933971,Hiut Denim jeans worn by Meghan Markle shares secrets,Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle.,2024-01-10,"Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle. That was the Duchess of Sussex's first official royal visit to Wales. Now the Welsh company Hiut Denim has opened its doors to TV cameras to reveal exactly what goes into making its version of the wardrobe staple. The company, founded and run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt in Cardigan, Ceredigion, has been making handmade jeans to order since 2012. It employs 25 people and is currently producing about 10,00 pairs a year. Clare said since the Meghan effect brought the small company 100 miles (106km) west of the Welsh capital to global attention its staff had become used to cameras. Presenter Gregg Wallace was given access to the factory for an episode of BBC 2's Inside the Factory: Jeans. ""When Meghan Markle wore our jeans we had the world's press on our doorstep, so our grand masters [workers], as we call them, have become used to being featured in things... it's good for business,"" added Clare. Cardigan has a long history of jeans making. For almost 40 years the town was home to a factory that made 35,000 pairs of jeans each week for giant UK retailer Marks & Spencer. In 2002 that plant closed with the loss of 400 jobs when production was moved to Morocco to cut costs. Then 10 years later, when the Hieatts were looking to open a factory to start making jeans, they chose Cardigan, employing machinists who had previously worked in the old factory. The company name is a combination of the first two letters of their surname - Hieatt - and the word ""utility"". The reference to its workers as ""grand masters"" acknowledges the fact that some of them have more than 40 years of jeans making experience. New joiners have to train for three years before they can start making jeans for customers. A single pair of jeans from the company can cost from £150 for their cheapest pair up to almost £300 for their most expensive pair. In addition to visiting the Hiut factory, in his BBC2 documentary Gregg Wallace also visited one of Hiut's Italian denim suppliers, Candiani Denim on the outskirts of Milan. There he saw the raw cotton being delivered, plucked, mixed, detangled, spun into yarn, dye and woven before the finished denim was dispatched to clients. Back in the Cardigan factory, the cameras showed the company's pride in its role in returning jeans manufacturing to the area, with ""our town is making jeans again"" emblazoned on the wall. Wallace also witnessed grand master cutter Claudio Belotti creating the 16 denim pieces that make up a pair of the company's jeans, before having a less successful go himself. He then moved into the assembly area where grand master sewer Amanda Humphry began to sew the pieces together with different sewers working on each stage of the 27-stage process. Copper buttons are added at one station, rivets at another, before the product is complete and ready to be sent out to the customer. Was Clare nervous about revealing company secrets? ""No, we're very happy to share how our jeans are made,"" she said. ""The process of how are jeans are made is not unique, it's just the skills and craftsmanship of our team which is unique for us because they've got so much experience and the way that we do it."" Since the programme aired on Tuesday the company has been enjoying another moment in the spotlight, so much so it had to stop selling on their website. ""We've been getting lots of emails and we stayed late in the factory last night answering all the chatbot queries, loads and loads of queries in fact,"" said Clare. ""We've learned previously after the Meghan Markle exposure and we were inundated with orders and people were waiting three or four months for a pair of jeans,"" said Clare. Instead they now release their slots for purchasing jeans in batches. So what are the company's plans for the future? With a more mature workforce, it wants to start a trainee jeans maker programme and is looking to take on two new recruits. ""Most of our makers are over 50 and we're very conscious we need new blood,"" said Clare. ""Hopefully they'll stay with us another 20 years.""

Millie-Rae, 11, has been home-educated by her mum Seana-lee in Merthyr Tydfil, since September. She is one of 5,330 children in Wales not being taught in school - the highest number on record. The Welsh government said it recognised the right of parents to teach their own children, but, in most cases, children were best served by attending school. Seana-lee originally took Millie-Rae out of school during the pandemic as she felt he daughter was not being provided with enough work. But within a few months of returning, she fell behind as she was struggling with the school environment, her mother said. When Millie-Rae began secondary school in September, she lasted just five days before refusing to go. Seana-lee said: ""Her confidence was slipping and she was starting not to go out with friends. She was getting tearful and stressed about not wanting to go back in. ""Her whole behaviour is totally different when she's in school."" Millie-Rae has recently been referred by a GP for ADHD investigations and struggled concentrating in a large, loud classroom. Seana-lee said: ""She lives in a daydream, which can be frustrating sometimes. She's very ditsy but also very clever. School didn't suit her as she needs that one-to-one attention. ""Home is a safe environment for her - she can fidget all she likes and as long as she's learning then I'm happy."" Seana-lee said she was nervous to homeschool Millie-Rae because her family were against it. ""You have to have thick skin to do this, it's not been easy,"" she said. ""Homeschooling has definitely brought her out of her shell and has given her the confidence I think she needed."" Millie-Rae said although she misses seeing her friends regularly, she goes to a weekly drama group to keep up her social life. ""Homeschooling is helping me to live and be happy. Finally, my mental health and my anxiety feels calmer,"" she said. Latest figures show that, from September 2022 to August 2023, 5,330 children were registered as being homeschooled in Wales, compared to 2,626 five years ago. There were fewer than 900 children identified as having their education at home a decade ago. Of the 22 councils in Wales, 17 have seen an increase with Carmarthenshire the highest - up from 457 two years before to 739. Figures may be inflated due to greater attempts from councils to find and record families who have opted against school. Victoria Williams, director of Smart Education Wales, a tuition centre based in Bridgend and Newport, said Covid was one of the main reasons behind the rise. ""Many are now suffering with mental health issues and social anxiety. They are struggling to fit back into society,"" she said. ""Children are also behind educationally and I think a lot of parents enjoyed the lockdowns and realised that they had the ability to educate their children themselves."" A Welsh government spokesman said about 1% of children in Wales were educated this way. ""The home educator's handbook provides advice to parents and carers who are home educating, or considering doing so,"" they added. ""We have also worked with every local authority to make sure that the most appropriate provision can be identified and put in place for each child.""","['Anxiety', 'Wales', 'Merthyr Tydfil', 'Mental health', 'Welsh government', 'Home education', 'Homeschooling']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D093/production/_132259335_mediaitem132086729.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/183D6/production/_132268299_homeschoolfamily.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135B6/production/_132268297_millieraeschool.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E885/production/_132252595_mediaitem132252590.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/C175/production/_132252594_mediaitem132252593.jpg']","['By Eleri Griffiths', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

Transport minister Lee Waters said Phil Jones, who chaired a task force on 20mph and whose company advised on the legislation, is leading the exercise. Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh government of marking its own homework. The Welsh government said Mr Jones is ""well-placed to assess whether clarifications... are needed"". It said the review will look at the implementation of the policy, rather than the policy itself. Plaid Cymru said the review should be independent of those who played any part in the legislation. The exercise is expected to look at how councils draw up 30mph exceptions to the limit. The Welsh government has said for months it would hold a review, which has been backed by the two ministers running to replace Mark Drakeford - Vaughan Gething and Jeremy Miles. In the Senedd on Wednesday afternoon Mr Waters said: ""I've asked Phil Jones, who's leading the review for us, to consider whether further tweaks to the guidance on exceptions would be helpful, for example, by explicitly including major bus routes as one of the local criteria they can consider."" Mr Jones led a task force group formed by Mr Waters in 2019, which said a default 20mph speed limit should be introduced ""as quickly as possible"". It made recommendations about how Welsh ministers should introduce the law, which came into effect last September. A Freedom of Information Act request said that Phil Jones Associates, his company, was engaged by Welsh government to offer advice on the legislation. After the Senedd voted, in July 2020, in favour of a national default 20mph speed limit, Mr Jones issued a press release saying he was ""naturally delighted"". ""A 20mph speed limit will mean safer streets and will also encourage more walking and cycling for everyday journeys - which is especially important during the Covid-19 pandemic where people are being discouraged from using public transport,"" he said. On Monday the first minister Mr Drakeford accepted that the policy needed to be fine-tuned because of inconsistencies in approach between different councils. Mr Waters has said that the proportion of roads still at 30mph varied greatly between councils - ""from over 10% in Swansea and Bridgend, to under one per cent in four north Wales authorities."" Natasha Asghar, Conservative shadow transport minister, said: ""The Welsh government is marking its own homework on the hugely unpopular 20mph speed limit. ""Surely the same people who recommended the Welsh government should implement this policy should not be leading the review into it, as it will hardly be impartial and a true reflection of reality."" A Plaid Cymru spokesman said: ""This appointment will no doubt be seen by many as Welsh government wanting to play judge and jury. For its own credibility the review should be independent of those who played any part with the legislation."" ""We need detail about how this review will be conducted, and how it intends to ensure that the further necessary exemptions are implemented promptly."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This review, as we set out in October, is looking at how the new default 20mph speed limit has been implemented across Wales. It is not a review into the policy itself which has been overwhelmingly supported by Senedd members from three parties.

Millie-Rae, 11, has been home-educated by her mum Seana-lee in Merthyr Tydfil, since September. She is one of 5,330 children in Wales not being taught in school - the highest number on record. The Welsh government said it recognised the right of parents to teach their own children, but, in most cases, children were best served by attending school. Seana-lee originally took Millie-Rae out of school during the pandemic as she felt he daughter was not being provided with enough work. But within a few months of returning, she fell behind as she was struggling with the school environment, her mother said. When Millie-Rae began secondary school in September, she lasted just five days before refusing to go. Seana-lee said: ""Her confidence was slipping and she was starting not to go out with friends. She was getting tearful and stressed about not wanting to go back in. ""Her whole behaviour is totally different when she's in school."" Millie-Rae has recently been referred by a GP for ADHD investigations and struggled concentrating in a large, loud classroom. Seana-lee said: ""She lives in a daydream, which can be frustrating sometimes. She's very ditsy but also very clever. School didn't suit her as she needs that one-to-one attention. ""Home is a safe environment for her - she can fidget all she likes and as long as she's learning then I'm happy."" Seana-lee said she was nervous to homeschool Millie-Rae because her family were against it. ""You have to have thick skin to do this, it's not been easy,"" she said. ""Homeschooling has definitely brought her out of her shell and has given her the confidence I think she needed."" Millie-Rae said although she misses seeing her friends regularly, she goes to a weekly drama group to keep up her social life. ""Homeschooling is helping me to live and be happy.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67940087,Wales 20mph speed limit adviser to lead review,A transport consultant who told the Welsh government how to implement its default 20mph speed limit has been asked to review how it works.,2024-01-10,"A transport consultant who told the Welsh government how to implement its default 20mph speed limit has been asked to review how it works. Transport minister Lee Waters said Phil Jones, who chaired a task force on 20mph and whose company advised on the legislation, is leading the exercise. Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh government of marking its own homework. The Welsh government said Mr Jones is ""well-placed to assess whether clarifications... are needed"". It said the review will look at the implementation of the policy, rather than the policy itself. Plaid Cymru said the review should be independent of those who played any part in the legislation. The exercise is expected to look at how councils draw up 30mph exceptions to the limit. The Welsh government has said for months it would hold a review, which has been backed by the two ministers running to replace Mark Drakeford - Vaughan Gething and Jeremy Miles. In the Senedd on Wednesday afternoon Mr Waters said: ""I've asked Phil Jones, who's leading the review for us, to consider whether further tweaks to the guidance on exceptions would be helpful, for example, by explicitly including major bus routes as one of the local criteria they can consider."" Mr Jones led a task force group formed by Mr Waters in 2019, which said a default 20mph speed limit should be introduced ""as quickly as possible"". It made recommendations about how Welsh ministers should introduce the law, which came into effect last September. A Freedom of Information Act request said that Phil Jones Associates, his company, was engaged by Welsh government to offer advice on the legislation. After the Senedd voted, in July 2020, in favour of a national default 20mph speed limit, Mr Jones issued a press release saying he was ""naturally delighted"". ""A 20mph speed limit will mean safer streets and will also encourage more walking and cycling for everyday journeys - which is especially important during the Covid-19 pandemic where people are being discouraged from using public transport,"" he said. On Monday the first minister Mr Drakeford accepted that the policy needed to be fine-tuned because of inconsistencies in approach between different councils. Mr Waters has said that the proportion of roads still at 30mph varied greatly between councils - ""from over 10% in Swansea and Bridgend, to under one per cent in four north Wales authorities."" Natasha Asghar, Conservative shadow transport minister, said: ""The Welsh government is marking its own homework on the hugely unpopular 20mph speed limit. ""Surely the same people who recommended the Welsh government should implement this policy should not be leading the review into it, as it will hardly be impartial and a true reflection of reality."" A Plaid Cymru spokesman said: ""This appointment will no doubt be seen by many as Welsh government wanting to play judge and jury. For its own credibility the review should be independent of those who played any part with the legislation."" ""We need detail about how this review will be conducted, and how it intends to ensure that the further necessary exemptions are implemented promptly."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This review, as we set out in October, is looking at how the new default 20mph speed limit has been implemented across Wales. It is not a review into the policy itself which has been overwhelmingly supported by Senedd members from three parties. ""As Phil Jones - a highly regarded transport planner and engineer - chaired the Welsh 20mph task force group, he is well-placed to assess whether clarifications in the policy are needed to encourage greater consistency.""","['Wales', 'Lee Waters', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16A3D/production/_125833729_20signcaldy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1639D/production/_132273019_mediaitem132273018.jpg']","['By David Deans & Gareth Lewis', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67935209,"Wales among worst countries for people surviving cancers, data suggests","Wales is one of the worst countries for people surviving three of the six deadliest forms of cancer, according to new data.",2024-01-10,"Wales is one of the worst countries for people surviving three of the six deadliest forms of cancer, according to new data. The Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce has compared 33 similarly wealthy nations in a survival league table. Wales ranks 32nd for stomach cancer, 31st for pancreatic and lung, 21st for liver and oesophageal and 12th for brain. The Welsh government said it is committed to improving cancer outcomes. The taskforce - a partnership of cancer charities including Tenovus Cancer Care - suggests Wales and the rest of the UK rank below most other countries for five-year survival rates. South Korea, Belgium, the United States, Australia and China were the countries that scored the highest. The six deadliest cancers are lung, liver, brain, oesophageal, pancreatic and stomach. More than 90,000 people are diagnosed with one of these six in the UK every year, and they account for 67,000 deaths - about half all cancer deaths. The chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, Judi Rhys, said people with these cancers had a ""shockingly low life expectancy"". Ms Rhys, who is also chairwoman of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce Wales subgroup, said: ""The actions we've repeatedly called for - targeted screening and monitoring those most at risk - would have a huge impact on survival. ""These latest statistics should be a strong reminder to Welsh government of the importance of prioritising and accelerating cancer survival initiatives."" She said ""exciting developments going on"" included a breath test that helps detect pancreatic cancer, which she wants more research done on. ""Similarly some of the tests that can be used for things like Barrett's oesophagus - which is the precursor often to throat cancer - we have some very simple, well tolerated tools that can be used which would be able to detect those cancers earlier. ""We're not rolling those out across Wales at the moment and that is a real concern to us."" About 15,400 people survive five years in the UK but, if rates were the same as the best performing countries, that could be as many as 23,775 people. The taskforce's report suggests delayed diagnosis and slow access to treatment could be to blame. Many patients were only diagnosed after an emergency admission to hospital or an urgent referral after their symptoms become severe. The Wales Cancer Network published a three-year cancer improvement plan last year, including plans for rapid diagnostic centres. The most recent NHS performance figures showed 56% of patients were treated within the target 62-days of cancer being suspected. The Welsh government said cancer is one of the six planning priorities for the NHS and it is committed to improving cancer outcomes. It said: ""The NHS Executive has introduced a national intervention that specifically targets improvement in service provision for gynaecological, urological, and lower gastrointestinal cancers - the cancers with the most challenging cancer performance.""","['Wales', 'Cancer', 'Welsh government', 'NHS Wales', 'Health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D8D3/production/_132270555_2e32df131590af55a7c84074e89e1b55c271355f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8AB3/production/_132270553_judirhystenovuscancercarenew.jpg']","['By Jenny Rees', 'BBC Wales health correspondent']",UK,Wales

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67933971,Hiut Denim jeans worn by Meghan Markle shares secrets,Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle.,2024-01-10,"Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle. That was the Duchess of Sussex's first official royal visit to Wales. Now the Welsh company Hiut Denim has opened its doors to TV cameras to reveal exactly what goes into making its version of the wardrobe staple. The company, founded and run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt in Cardigan, Ceredigion, has been making handmade jeans to order since 2012. It employs 25 people and is currently producing about 10,00 pairs a year. Clare said since the Meghan effect brought the small company 100 miles (106km) west of the Welsh capital to global attention its staff had become used to cameras. Presenter Gregg Wallace was given access to the factory for an episode of BBC 2's Inside the Factory: Jeans. ""When Meghan Markle wore our jeans we had the world's press on our doorstep, so our grand masters [workers], as we call them, have become used to being featured in things... it's good for business,"" added Clare. Cardigan has a long history of jeans making. For almost 40 years the town was home to a factory that made 35,000 pairs of jeans each week for giant UK retailer Marks & Spencer. In 2002 that plant closed with the loss of 400 jobs when production was moved to Morocco to cut costs. Then 10 years later, when the Hieatts were looking to open a factory to start making jeans, they chose Cardigan, employing machinists who had previously worked in the old factory. The company name is a combination of the first two letters of their surname - Hieatt - and the word ""utility"". The reference to its workers as ""grand masters"" acknowledges the fact that some of them have more than 40 years of jeans making experience. New joiners have to train for three years before they can start making jeans for customers. A single pair of jeans from the company can cost from £150 for their cheapest pair up to almost £300 for their most expensive pair. In addition to visiting the Hiut factory, in his BBC2 documentary Gregg Wallace also visited one of Hiut's Italian denim suppliers, Candiani Denim on the outskirts of Milan. There he saw the raw cotton being delivered, plucked, mixed, detangled, spun into yarn, dye and woven before the finished denim was dispatched to clients. Back in the Cardigan factory, the cameras showed the company's pride in its role in returning jeans manufacturing to the area, with ""our town is making jeans again"" emblazoned on the wall. Wallace also witnessed grand master cutter Claudio Belotti creating the 16 denim pieces that make up a pair of the company's jeans, before having a less successful go himself. He then moved into the assembly area where grand master sewer Amanda Humphry began to sew the pieces together with different sewers working on each stage of the 27-stage process. Copper buttons are added at one station, rivets at another, before the product is complete and ready to be sent out to the customer. Was Clare nervous about revealing company secrets? ""No, we're very happy to share how our jeans are made,"" she said. ""The process of how are jeans are made is not unique, it's just the skills and craftsmanship of our team which is unique for us because they've got so much experience and the way that we do it."" Since the programme aired on Tuesday the company has been enjoying another moment in the spotlight, so much so it had to stop selling on their website. ""We've been getting lots of emails and we stayed late in the factory last night answering all the chatbot queries, loads and loads of queries in fact,"" said Clare. ""We've learned previously after the Meghan Markle exposure and we were inundated with orders and people were waiting three or four months for a pair of jeans,"" said Clare. Instead they now release their slots for purchasing jeans in batches. So what are the company's plans for the future? With a more mature workforce, it wants to start a trainee jeans maker programme and is looking to take on two new recruits. ""Most of our makers are over 50 and we're very conscious we need new blood,"" said Clare. ""Hopefully they'll stay with us another 20 years.""

MPs and campaigners have called for Mr Bates' honour to be re-submitted now Ms Vennells has agreed to relinquish her's in the face of a public outcry. There have also been a number of online petitions calling for Mr Bates, from Llandudno, Conwy, to be honoured, one of which has more than 80,000 signatures. The scandal has been brought to the fore by ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. It lasted from 1999 and 2015 and saw 736 sub-postmasters unfairly prosecuted due to a faulty IT system Senior minister Esther McVey said she wanted to see Mr Bates knighted ""as soon as possible"". ""Anybody can nominate him and I'm quite sure we will see Sir Alan as soon as possible,"" the Tory MP told GB News. The prime minister's press secretary argued it was ""hard to think of someone more deserving of being rewarded through the honours system than him"". Asked if she agreed with Ms McVey about the knighthood the official said: ""That sounds like common sense."" But Mr Bates told BBC Radio 4's World at One it was ""not about me"". ""It's about the whole group, and it's about getting this money out to people as soon as possible, so they can try and get on with their lives and try and put this behind them,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also backed the move. His spokesman said: ""Alan Bates clearly has emerged as a hero throughout this for the way in which he has led the campaign, the fortitude and resolve he was shown given everything that has been thrown at him throughout this process. ""Obviously honours have their own independent process, but I'm sure that is something the public would regard as entirely appropriate and we would support."" Meanwhile, a former sub-postmaster jailed in the Post Office scandal says he is not convinced by Rishi Sunak's latest plan. Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey, was locked up for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. Upon hearing that new legislation is to be rushed in to quash convictions he said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"". He added he has been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Plaid Cymru has called for a review of any contracts held by the Welsh government with Fujitsu - the Japanese company whose system was at the heart of the scandal.","['Wales', 'Llandudno', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/240A/production/_132162290_mediaitem132162289.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C04A/production/_132162294_tobyjones.jpg']","['By James McCarthy', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67940087,Wales 20mph speed limit adviser to lead review,A transport consultant who told the Welsh government how to implement its default 20mph speed limit has been asked to review how it works.,2024-01-10,"A transport consultant who told the Welsh government how to implement its default 20mph speed limit has been asked to review how it works. Transport minister Lee Waters said Phil Jones, who chaired a task force on 20mph and whose company advised on the legislation, is leading the exercise. Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh government of marking its own homework. The Welsh government said Mr Jones is ""well-placed to assess whether clarifications... are needed"". It said the review will look at the implementation of the policy, rather than the policy itself. Plaid Cymru said the review should be independent of those who played any part in the legislation. The exercise is expected to look at how councils draw up 30mph exceptions to the limit. The Welsh government has said for months it would hold a review, which has been backed by the two ministers running to replace Mark Drakeford - Vaughan Gething and Jeremy Miles. In the Senedd on Wednesday afternoon Mr Waters said: ""I've asked Phil Jones, who's leading the review for us, to consider whether further tweaks to the guidance on exceptions would be helpful, for example, by explicitly including major bus routes as one of the local criteria they can consider."" Mr Jones led a task force group formed by Mr Waters in 2019, which said a default 20mph speed limit should be introduced ""as quickly as possible"". It made recommendations about how Welsh ministers should introduce the law, which came into effect last September. A Freedom of Information Act request said that Phil Jones Associates, his company, was engaged by Welsh government to offer advice on the legislation. After the Senedd voted, in July 2020, in favour of a national default 20mph speed limit, Mr Jones issued a press release saying he was ""naturally delighted"". ""A 20mph speed limit will mean safer streets and will also encourage more walking and cycling for everyday journeys - which is especially important during the Covid-19 pandemic where people are being discouraged from using public transport,"" he said. On Monday the first minister Mr Drakeford accepted that the policy needed to be fine-tuned because of inconsistencies in approach between different councils. Mr Waters has said that the proportion of roads still at 30mph varied greatly between councils - ""from over 10% in Swansea and Bridgend, to under one per cent in four north Wales authorities."" Natasha Asghar, Conservative shadow transport minister, said: ""The Welsh government is marking its own homework on the hugely unpopular 20mph speed limit. ""Surely the same people who recommended the Welsh government should implement this policy should not be leading the review into it, as it will hardly be impartial and a true reflection of reality."" A Plaid Cymru spokesman said: ""This appointment will no doubt be seen by many as Welsh government wanting to play judge and jury. For its own credibility the review should be independent of those who played any part with the legislation."" ""We need detail about how this review will be conducted, and how it intends to ensure that the further necessary exemptions are implemented promptly."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This review, as we set out in October, is looking at how the new default 20mph speed limit has been implemented across Wales. It is not a review into the policy itself which has been overwhelmingly supported by Senedd members from three parties. ""As Phil Jones - a highly regarded transport planner and engineer - chaired the Welsh 20mph task force group, he is well-placed to assess whether clarifications in the policy are needed to encourage greater consistency.""","['Wales', 'Lee Waters', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16A3D/production/_125833729_20signcaldy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1639D/production/_132273019_mediaitem132273018.jpg']","['By David Deans & Gareth Lewis', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Wales

Funding for a childcare scheme has been cut by the Welsh government in an attempt to direct more money to frontline public services. The government says demand for care had been lower than expected. But the Women's Equality Network (WEN) charity said it was the ""wrong reaction"". The gender-equality group said the government should instead make sure families can access the service. In October, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans revealed cuts mid-way through the financial year so more funding could be switched to the NHS and rail operator Transport for Wales. It included a cut of £16.1m to the childcare offer which provides 30-hours of care a week for three and four-year-olds. The government said the money was available after updated forecasts of demand from parents. Another £11.2m will be taken out of the policy next year, again based on the latest forecasts, with the government saying it will have ""no anticipated direct impact to delivery"". But Jessica Laimann of WEN said the reduced demand was ""most likely a mismatch between what families need and what is actually available"". ""Cutting the budget is certainly the wrong reaction to that,"" she told the Senedd's finance committee. Research by Oxfam Cymru last year showed a ""critical need for affordable childcare in Wales"", she said. She added: ""High childcare costs are compounding the financial pressures for families, pushing parents - especially single mothers - into debt and poverty."" She also said women were more likely to work in and rely on care services. ""So if we are still seeing cuts to these provisions women are likely to bear the brunt of that."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The childcare offer is a demand-led programme and support is made available for all eligible parents that apply. ""We have prioritised communications across Wales to increase awareness and encourage take-up among eligible parents, and we will continue with this in 2024-25.""","['Wales', 'Childcare', 'Welsh government']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1363B/production/_128991497_gettyimages-494678785.jpg'],"['By Daniel Davies', 'BBC Wales political correspondent']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67933785,"Scandal-hit S4C needs new chair, say Welsh MPs","The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said.",2024-01-10,"The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said. MPs on the Welsh Affairs Committee said they were ""concerned"" by evidence given by the organisation's current chairman Rhodri Williams, on Wednesday. They accused the channel's board of an ""absence of cultural leadership"". Mr Williams' term ends on 1 April - it is up to UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to reinstate him, or appoint his replacement. Committee chairman Stephen Crabb told BBC Wales that Mr Williams should not be reappointed in April, rather than immediately replaced. S4C has been in turmoil after a string of bullying allegations and the sacking of two officers, including the chief executive. Both have denied accusations made of them. In committee on Wednesday, Mr Crabb accused Mr Williams of acting as ""judge, jury and executioner"" in his actions last autumn. The MP was speaking in relation to S4C chief executive Sian Doyle, who was sacked in November after bullying allegations which she denies were investigated by a law firm. Mr Williams clarified that the decision to dismiss Ms Doyle was made by S4C's board, but said he had personally sacked Llinos Griffin-Williams, a decision ratified by the board later. Former chief content officer Ms Griffin-Williams had allegedly criticising ex-Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips's Welsh language skills in Nantes during the Rugby World Cup. She denies this and has threatened legal action against S4C. Mr Williams defended his actions to MPs, saying they were in ""the best interest of the staff"", and that he would be ""very happy"" to continue for a second term as chair. In a letter to Ms Frazer, committee chairman and Conservative MP Stephen Crabb says: ""We are concerned at the approach Mr Williams and the board took in seeking advice and reaching assurance in relation to key decisions it made. Mr Crabb added that the committee was ""not satisfied by the assurances from Mr Williams"" and lead non-executive board member Chris Jones ""that the different complaints made against specific individuals had been handled equitably and with proper consideration of the fair treatment of all those involved"". He said the committee was ""concerned about the ability of the current leadership to oversee the changes required"". ""Given the importance of S4C and the scale of the challenges with respect to improving governance and culture within the organisation, we recommend that the government appoint a new chair to take this work forward,"" Mr Crabb added. At the committee session, Mr Williams said that the board had ""acted effectively and quickly"" once they were aware of the problem at the channel and put in place a process which ""gave safety and security"" to staff who wanted to speak up. Capital Law was commissioned to hold an investigation after a letter from the Bectu union claimed there was a ""culture of fear"" among staff. In the Cardiff law firm's report, participants said that Ms Doyle's leadership style was ""dictatorial, creating a culture of fear"". Mr Williams told the MPs that the report provided a ""damning indictment of the leadership culture"" over the last two years, which he claimed ""got even worse"" once the investigation was underway. ""Capital Law makes it very clear where responsibility for that lies, I don't think it is with me or the board,"" he said. The report, Mr Williams said, makes clear that the chief executive, Ms Doyle, acted in a ""confrontational, inconsiderate and abusive manner, and that is where the failure has been"". As a result, he says, the non-executive members of the board ""acted decisively and quickly to terminate the chief executive's employment"". ""I am confident that it was the right decision, and that we have done the best in the interest of the staff of S4C and also in the interest of the organisation as a whole,"" he added. Mr Crabb questioned whether the two senior leaders were treated fairly, compared to complaints made against the chair Mr Williams. Mr Jones said the accusations were ""of a very different nature and very different circumstances"" and that he believed that all cases have been dealt with in an ""appropriate manner"". Discussing the dismissal of Ms Griffin-Williams, Mr Williams said her actions ""created immediate detrimental effect to the reputation of S4C"" and that he had no doubt that what happened constituted ""gross misconduct"". Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake also raised concerns that neither Ms Doyle or Ms Griffin-Williams had received advance sight of the Capital Law report, despite being criticised in it. Although S4C has been without a permanent chief executive since November, chairman Rhodri Williams confirmed that the process to find a replacement for Sian Doyle had not started. He said there was ""no timeline for recruitment"", but that ""sooner rather than later would be best"". Mr Williams became S4C's chairman in 2020. Asked, by Mr Crabb, if it might be better for the channel to ""move on with new leadership"" in the role, Mr Williams replied: ""That's certainly not what I'm told by members of staff or by members of the production community."" The decision on whether he will be offered a second term was a matter for the culture secretary, he told the committee. Ms Doyle has said she does not ""recognise or accept the allegations made"" about her time at the Welsh language broadcaster.","['Wales', 'S4C', 'Welsh language', 'Stephen Crabb', 'Lucy Frazer']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C7A/production/_114922967_20201014_rhodri_williams_9758.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/462E/production/_132266971_mediaitem129577093.jpg']","['By Elliw Gwawr, Adrian Browne and David Deans', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Wales

A maths teacher at Pencoedtre High School in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said a decline in pupil behaviour left staff with ""no choice"" . NASUWT said six schools in Wales are now in disputes over classroom safety. The Vale of Glamorgan council said it was taking steps to ""improve the working environment"". ""We've seen a decline in pupil behaviour, especially truancy in classes, and physical and verbal abuse of teachers,"" said teacher Mark Adams, a NASUWT representative. ""My members are at risk, and we've decided enough is enough."" Mr Adams said nothing had come out of eight months of negotiations with school leaders on the issue. ""They don't seem to be taking the matter seriously,"" he said, and that abuse was adding to the strain on staff in a profession that is already becoming increasingly difficult. ""It's affecting the learning of the children, but also the physical and mental health of teachers at the school,"" he added. ""We've got a number of teachers off at present on work-related stress, and we'd rather get them back in the classroom. ""Long term we'll lose teachers, good teachers from this industry."" Strike action by staff affiliated to the NASUWT union meant Pencoedtre High School was closed to the majority of pupils on Wednesday, with another five days of strike action planned. NASUWT's national officer in Wales, Neil Butler, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that ""gangs of learners"" have been ""roaming the corridors"" of the school. ""They've got a serious internal truancy problem,"" he said, and that verbal abuse had become a daily occurrence in classrooms. ""We're getting to the point where its almost accepted practice in schools and that's got to stop,"" he said. ""Without respect for teachers there can't be learning in classrooms."" ""It's also bad in other schools as well,"" Mr Butler said. ""We've got disputes in six schools across Wales over this issue. ""We don't think employers are taking our health and safety concerns seriously enough and we will be taking action in any school that doesn't protect its teachers."" While assaults on teachers are ""mercifully reasonably rare"", he said they were happening. ""When physical assaults are committed on teachers we expect a robust response from employers such as permanent exclusion and the situation dealt with seriously and we're not seeing that,"" he said. ""We are striking because of our employer's response,"" said Sharron Daly, NASUWT's representative for south east Wales. ""What's happening here isn't different from any other school in Wales - what's different here is the management's response to that behaviour."" Ms Daly said teachers did not feel ""empowered"" by senior management to deal with troublesome behaviour, calling the lack of behaviour policy in the school ""ridiculous"". ""Our members are not supported by management when they try to deal with those incidents of indiscipline."" In a joint statement, the Vale of Glamorgan council and the school said they were ""fully aware of the issues affecting staff and are working with the NASUWT to resolve them.

Killian Haslam, 18, told the inquest he was one of the children who jumped in to try and save Christopher. Mr Haslam claims another teenager, then 14, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was stood behind Christopher and asked ""Shall I push him?"". Mr Haslam said he remembered Christopher, who was ""joking around with his friends"", taking off his clothes but being unsure whether he wanted to enter the water. ""He was saying he couldn't swim and then he was saying he was a great swimmer,"" he told South Wales Central Coroner's Court in Pontypridd. Mr Haslam added that he did not believe the unnamed teen's pushing comment was made in a serious way. ""It was more a jokey way... I just carried on getting changed, it was freezing, I didn't take much notice,"" he said. Mr Haslam told the court he was getting changed when he heard lots of noise and returned to the river and was then one of the children who jumped in to help Christopher but he could not be saved. The court heard that another teenager remembered Christopher's last words as ""Killian, save me"". Killian Haslam also told the court that, about a week after Christopher's death, he met the teenager who cannot be named in a local park. ""He asked me what I put in my statement and I said I was going off what I heard, that he tripped,"" he said. ""He thanked me and I was taken aback that he was thankful and that's when he told me he pushed him.""

Millie Morgan, 18, told the inquest she also jumped in to help him after she realised he was in trouble. She said his head was ""going in and out"" of the water and that she ""could see he was giving up"". ""I tried to find him but the water was too black and muddy,"" she told the court. ""You couldn't see anything at all underneath the water. ""I looked for him for a while but I couldn't see him, and that's when the police came.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67933971,Hiut Denim jeans worn by Meghan Markle shares secrets,Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle.,2024-01-10,"Their jeans hit the fashion pages in 2018 when Meghan Markle wore a pair to Cardiff Castle. That was the Duchess of Sussex's first official royal visit to Wales. Now the Welsh company Hiut Denim has opened its doors to TV cameras to reveal exactly what goes into making its version of the wardrobe staple. The company, founded and run by husband and wife team David and Clare Hieatt in Cardigan, Ceredigion, has been making handmade jeans to order since 2012. It employs 25 people and is currently producing about 10,00 pairs a year. Clare said since the Meghan effect brought the small company 100 miles (106km) west of the Welsh capital to global attention its staff had become used to cameras. Presenter Gregg Wallace was given access to the factory for an episode of BBC 2's Inside the Factory: Jeans. ""When Meghan Markle wore our jeans we had the world's press on our doorstep, so our grand masters [workers], as we call them, have become used to being featured in things... it's good for business,"" added Clare. Cardigan has a long history of jeans making. For almost 40 years the town was home to a factory that made 35,000 pairs of jeans each week for giant UK retailer Marks & Spencer. In 2002 that plant closed with the loss of 400 jobs when production was moved to Morocco to cut costs. Then 10 years later, when the Hieatts were looking to open a factory to start making jeans, they chose Cardigan, employing machinists who had previously worked in the old factory. The company name is a combination of the first two letters of their surname - Hieatt - and the word ""utility"". The reference to its workers as ""grand masters"" acknowledges the fact that some of them have more than 40 years of jeans making experience. New joiners have to train for three years before they can start making jeans for customers. A single pair of jeans from the company can cost from £150 for their cheapest pair up to almost £300 for their most expensive pair. In addition to visiting the Hiut factory, in his BBC2 documentary Gregg Wallace also visited one of Hiut's Italian denim suppliers, Candiani Denim on the outskirts of Milan. There he saw the raw cotton being delivered, plucked, mixed, detangled, spun into yarn, dye and woven before the finished denim was dispatched to clients. Back in the Cardigan factory, the cameras showed the company's pride in its role in returning jeans manufacturing to the area, with ""our town is making jeans again"" emblazoned on the wall. Wallace also witnessed grand master cutter Claudio Belotti creating the 16 denim pieces that make up a pair of the company's jeans, before having a less successful go himself. He then moved into the assembly area where grand master sewer Amanda Humphry began to sew the pieces together with different sewers working on each stage of the 27-stage process. Copper buttons are added at one station, rivets at another, before the product is complete and ready to be sent out to the customer. Was Clare nervous about revealing company secrets? ""No, we're very happy to share how our jeans are made,"" she said. ""The process of how are jeans are made is not unique, it's just the skills and craftsmanship of our team which is unique for us because they've got so much experience and the way that we do it."" Since the programme aired on Tuesday the company has been enjoying another moment in the spotlight, so much so it had to stop selling on their website. ""We've been getting lots of emails and we stayed late in the factory last night answering all the chatbot queries, loads and loads of queries in fact,"" said Clare. ""We've learned previously after the Meghan Markle exposure and we were inundated with orders and people were waiting three or four months for a pair of jeans,"" said Clare. Instead they now release their slots for purchasing jeans in batches. So what are the company's plans for the future? With a more mature workforce, it wants to start a trainee jeans maker programme and is looking to take on two new recruits. ""Most of our makers are over 50 and we're very conscious we need new blood,"" said Clare. ""Hopefully they'll stay with us another 20 years.""

The pair from St Asaph in Denbighshire say it is ""pure luck"" the fire was spotted in time before  spreading to the rest of the house. Electrical retailer Currys have apologised and say they will be monitoring other models closely. The company is also reassuring others with similar machines that it hasn't found any cause for concern. Alyn London-Smith was relaxing at home on Saturday, 2 December, just before heading out to collect his wife Ellen from her work Christmas party. But, having smelled smoke, he went to investigate. ""I suddenly thought to myself that something wasn't right,"" he said. ""When I got to the kitchen all I could see was a smoky haze which seemed to be coming from the dishwasher. ""I opened the door and saw flames coming out of the bottom of the machine. ""It was pure luck that I hadn't gone to collect my wife already - 20 minutes later and the house would have been empty."" Mr London-Smith turned the dishwasher off and unsuccessfully attempted to put the fire out with water from the sink. ""Then I remembered that a friend had given me an old fire extinguisher a few years ago which was still in a shed in the garden,"" he said. ""I aimed it at the hole where the flames were coming through and it worked."" But the couple's kitchen ended up covered in soot and extinguisher powder. Ellen London-Smith added: ""It took us the rest of the weekend to clear the mess up - both of us working flat out with help from my mum. ""We bought the dishwasher, a Kenwood KID45S17, from Currys in December 2019 - almost exactly four years to the day it caught fire. ""They sent an engineer to look at it who confirmed that it couldn't be repaired and he seemed to think there'd been a wiring fault. ""Currys have also asked to have the fire-damaged dishwasher back so they can do further checks on it to see what could have gone wrong."" Currys initially offered the couple £79.86 in compensation as the dishwasher was out of warranty, but when approached by BBC Wales, agreed to cover the cost of a new one. A Currys spokesperson said: ""We were extremely shocked to hear about Mr and Mrs London-Smith's case and treat situations like these with the upmost seriousness. ""Our product safety experts have not discovered any inherent issues with this model of dishwasher which should cause other owners concern.

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now."" She said there were many people who ""thoroughly and richly deserve these awards"" but the system was ""devalued"" by others. ""The fact is the honours is broken and needs a complete overhaul by No 10 and onwards to the monarch who rubber stamps what happens,"" she said. ""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said. ""I'm a tiny voice in all of this but I just wanted to stand in solidarity with these people who I can't even begin to comprehend what they've been through."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X  and Facebook.

It follows a push from a group of deputies to allow douzaines to give the food waste they collect to any company they want for processing. A proposal has been lodged for debate later this year. If approved it would direct the States' Trading Supervisory Board (STSB) to look at processing waste locally. STSB has been contacted for a response. It is due to complete a process to award a new contract to a company to deal with the island's food waste soon. The requête has been lodged by Deputy John Dyke and signed by Deputies Carl Meerveld, Chris Blin, Simon Vermeulen and Chris Le Tissier. Policy and Resources President Lyndon Trott and member John Gollop are also signatories. A requête is a political petition, similar to a private members bill in the UK and requires seven signatories to force a debate on an issue by the States assembly. Mr Dyke said ""more flexibility"" in the waste disposal system ""could lead to better outcomes"". He said some parishes had expressed an interest in having a food waste option which could be more economical and environmentally friendly. ""The proposal is to give the parishes more discretion to choose how to dispose of their waste by removing the power of the Waste Disposal Authority to direct them... freeing up decision-making for the parishes,"" he said. Those behind it have also said they want to ensure ""the States of Guernsey do not create de facto monopolies for waste disposal, preventing entrepreneurs from providing competitive offerings"". They have said they ""are aware of several proven approaches for disposing of waste cost-effectively and environmentally sensitively and more than one local company that wishes to provide commercial solutions for the disposal of local food and other waste"". The requête will likely be debated at the March States meeting, but could be discussed in February if the States assembly rules are suspended.

Policy and Finance Committee Chair John Guille said he was still ""open to the idea"" of buying Sark Electricity Limited, the island's only commercial power provider. Two firms have been selected to design a new system for Sark, at a cost of about £8.6m. Alan Witney-Price, Sark Electricity Ltd (SEL) boss, is against the plans. The proposed scheme could include two 30m (100ft) wind turbines at Les Laches and a new solar farm, alongside diesel generators for resilience. Nearly 100 people attended a public meeting about the future of energy provision. It comes after Mr Witney-Price labelled the scheme ""nonsense"" and in a post on social media urged politicians to ""sit down with SEL and seek a middle ground that achieves our collective aims at no risk to the residents of Sark"". The current electrical infrastructure has been deemed to be a health and safety risk by independent experts. Mr Guille said: ""Compulsory purchase is still an option to the island as part of this project. ""I can't see a scenario where we'll end up with two competing systems and I think it will be resolved a long time before that."" Shane Lynch, the island's electricity regulator, said: ""Having two grid owners wouldn't be sustainable in the long-term, it's overkill and a waste of money."" A number of financing schemes for the wider £8.6m project have been suggested by Communities for Renewables, including a private bond issue. Guernsey's Policy and Resources Committee has said it has not considered a request from Chief Pleas for any funding. Jason Salisbury who runs Sark's only commercial dairy, told the public meeting that electricity was his biggest cost. ""It's from the minute I turn up, it's the lights going on, to the milking of the cows, to the processing of the milk to the cooling of the milk, it's just absolutely everything,"" he added. ""We're just worried about what is going to happen if this goes down, what happens to us?"" Sark resident Katrin Gratz said: ""This is a huge sum and I hope the island can afford it. I seriously doubt it though"". Fellow meeting attendee Lucy Belfield added: ""I thought the presentation was very good. My opinion is we have to go ahead with what they are suggesting as I can't see another option."" Chief Pleas will vote on whether to approve a design phase, which is expected to cost about £175,000, at its Christmas meeting on 17 January 2023.

It follows a push from a group of deputies to allow douzaines to give the food waste they collect to any company they want for processing. A proposal has been lodged for debate later this year. If approved it would direct the States' Trading Supervisory Board (STSB) to look at processing waste locally. STSB has been contacted for a response. It is due to complete a process to award a new contract to a company to deal with the island's food waste soon. The requête has been lodged by Deputy John Dyke and signed by Deputies Carl Meerveld, Chris Blin, Simon Vermeulen and Chris Le Tissier. Policy and Resources President Lyndon Trott and member John Gollop are also signatories. A requête is a political petition, similar to a private members bill in the UK and requires seven signatories to force a debate on an issue by the States assembly. Mr Dyke said ""more flexibility"" in the waste disposal system ""could lead to better outcomes"". He said some parishes had expressed an interest in having a food waste option which could be more economical and environmentally friendly. ""The proposal is to give the parishes more discretion to choose how to dispose of their waste by removing the power of the Waste Disposal Authority to direct them... freeing up decision-making for the parishes,"" he said. Those behind it have also said they want to ensure ""the States of Guernsey do not create de facto monopolies for waste disposal, preventing entrepreneurs from providing competitive offerings"". They have said they ""are aware of several proven approaches for disposing of waste cost-effectively and environmentally sensitively and more than one local company that wishes to provide commercial solutions for the disposal of local food and other waste"". The requête will likely be debated at the March States meeting, but could be discussed in February if the States assembly rules are suspended.

Sarah Griffith, who received her honour while in Guernsey, has returned her medal to 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to more than 700 people being prosecuted after faulty software made it appear money was missing. Ms Griffith said the honours system was ""broken"" when a former Post Office boss had been awarded a CBE. Paula Vennells, who served as CEO between 2012 and 2019, received the honour for services to the Post Office and to charity in the 2019 New Year's Honours - despite ongoing legal action against Post Office having been launched by 555 sub-postmasters in 2017. The former Post Office boss confirmed on Tuesday that she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the Horizon IT scandal. Ms Griffith said not stripping Ms Vennells of her CBE was ""insulting and pays a massive disservice to sub-postmasters and mistresses whose lives have been destroyed"". But she added Ms Vennells' decision to hand the award back did not detract from her own message that the honours system was broken. ""It's a serious thing to do, but I have been questioning the honours system for quite some time now,"" she said. ""I've just had a very uncomfortable feeling. ""It just became clear to me that I needed to send it back because owning it somehow feels very hollow now."" She said there were many people who ""thoroughly and richly deserve these awards"" but the system was ""devalued"" by others. ""The fact is the honours is broken and needs a complete overhaul by No 10 and onwards to the monarch who rubber stamps what happens,"" she said. ""I completely respect people have been given awards for the wonderful work they do [but] this is a personal decision."" She had received her honour in 2014 for services to charity. Ms Griffith posted the medal back along with a separate letter to King Charles III. ""There are these sub-posters all around the country whose lives are completely and utterly broken,"" she said. ""I'm a tiny voice in all of this but I just wanted to stand in solidarity with these people who I can't even begin to comprehend what they've been through."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X  and Facebook.

Policy and Finance Committee Chair John Guille said he was still ""open to the idea"" of buying Sark Electricity Limited, the island's only commercial power provider. Two firms have been selected to design a new system for Sark, at a cost of about £8.6m. Alan Witney-Price, Sark Electricity Ltd (SEL) boss, is against the plans. The proposed scheme could include two 30m (100ft) wind turbines at Les Laches and a new solar farm, alongside diesel generators for resilience. Nearly 100 people attended a public meeting about the future of energy provision. It comes after Mr Witney-Price labelled the scheme ""nonsense"" and in a post on social media urged politicians to ""sit down with SEL and seek a middle ground that achieves our collective aims at no risk to the residents of Sark"". The current electrical infrastructure has been deemed to be a health and safety risk by independent experts. Mr Guille said: ""Compulsory purchase is still an option to the island as part of this project. ""I can't see a scenario where we'll end up with two competing systems and I think it will be resolved a long time before that."" Shane Lynch, the island's electricity regulator, said: ""Having two grid owners wouldn't be sustainable in the long-term, it's overkill and a waste of money."" A number of financing schemes for the wider £8.6m project have been suggested by Communities for Renewables, including a private bond issue. Guernsey's Policy and Resources Committee has said it has not considered a request from Chief Pleas for any funding. Jason Salisbury who runs Sark's only commercial dairy, told the public meeting that electricity was his biggest cost. ""It's from the minute I turn up, it's the lights going on, to the milking of the cows, to the processing of the milk to the cooling of the milk, it's just absolutely everything,"" he added. ""We're just worried about what is going to happen if this goes down, what happens to us?"" Sark resident Katrin Gratz said: ""This is a huge sum and I hope the island can afford it. I seriously doubt it though"". Fellow meeting attendee Lucy Belfield added: ""I thought the presentation was very good. My opinion is we have to go ahead with what they are suggesting as I can't see another option."" Chief Pleas will vote on whether to approve a design phase, which is expected to cost about £175,000, at its Christmas meeting on 17 January 2023.

""In these particular cases the scammers have used CryptoCom as the recipient company. ""The payment normally is something that the person wouldn’t recognise so scammers would tend to say crypto as people are unfamiliar with this."" Officers said scammers would usually explain that a victim's account had been compromised and that they must move money to other accounts.Alternatively they would tell them their account was blocked and to unfreeze it, they must provide personal details.SoJP said islanders should not trust caller ID or the number displayed on your phone, and to not to give any personal information - including security codes.It also said to end the call, wait five minutes, and to contact the service provider rather than the numbers provided.

The force said as the fraudsters were ""so convincing, victims are even by passing their one-time secure key and giving that to the scammers"".It said: ""Victims of these scams will either receive a fake text from an entity, in most cases the name of a high-street bank, claiming that a payment of a certain amount, was attempted on their account. ""In these particular cases the scammers have used CryptoCom as the recipient company. ""The payment normally is something that the person wouldn’t recognise so scammers would tend to say crypto as people are unfamiliar with this."" Officers said scammers would usually explain that a victim's account had been compromised and that they must move money to other accounts.Alternatively they would tell them their account was blocked and to unfreeze it, they must provide personal details.SoJP said islanders should not trust caller ID or the number displayed on your phone, and to not to give any personal information - including security codes.It also said to end the call, wait five minutes, and to contact the service provider rather than the numbers provided.

Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67930783,Rishi Sunak facing major Tory revolt over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.,2024-01-10,"Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Over 30 backbenchers on the right of the party are backing plans to change the bill next week to make it harder for people to appeal deportation. The amendments underline the scale of Tory division over the policy, which the PM has made a priority. Ministers insist the bill allows only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. Those backing the amendments include former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and a clutch of former cabinet ministers, including former home secretary Suella Braverman. Ex-migration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the draft law last month and is a leading rebel, said the current bill would fail to prevent a ""merry-go-round"" of individual appeals. The Rwanda policy dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer arguing the prime minister had been ""taken hostage by his own party"". He added that reports over the weekend that he had doubts about the policy when he was chancellor showed Mr Sunak had been ""caught red handed"". ""He knows the Rwanda gimmick won't work - but he can't be honest about it because he's too scared of his own MPs,"" he added. In reply, the prime minister said the government would deliver on its promise to halt migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. Mr Sunak said Labour had not put forward a ""single practical idea"" to reduce illegal migration, and ""can never be trusted to stop the boats"". The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds. Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights. The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended. A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful. However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"". He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum. He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly. Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably. Ministers could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament. And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law. The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67933440,RSPCA: Pets as prizes banned by all 22 Welsh councils,All councils in Wales are banning pets as prizes at funfairs and events.,2024-01-10,"All councils in Wales are banning pets as prizes at funfairs and events. Twenty-one local authorities have already implemented the ban, while Powys council has confirmed it will be joining them. It comes as part of the RSPCA's No Fun At The Fair campaign, which is calling for regulation on events which have historically given animals as rewards. But the charity says an outright Welsh government ban is needed to prevent the practice happening on private land. Sioned Nikolic, RSPCA Cymru's public affairs officer, said: ""Only a few months ago we were calling on 10 local authorities to take action and now we have all councils in agreement that this will not be happening on their land."" But the ban does not mean the practice cannot continue on private land. ""We know that this is something people care about, with many assuming it is already banned,"" she said. ""We would ultimately like to see pets being given away as prizes banned outrightly by the Welsh government."" Since 2020, there have been 42 reports about pets being given as prizes made to the RSPCA, but the charity fears many incidents go unreported. Goldfish are the animal most commonly associated with prize-giving, but the RSPCA says they are easily stressed and very often fish that are won as prizes suffer miserably from shock and oxygen starvation or die prematurely from changes in water temperature. Ms Nikolic added: ""They're misunderstood pets as they can make great companions, but can actually be challenging to look after. New owners must do their research before they acquire the fish, not afterwards. ""Before bringing a fish home for the first time, it's important to set the tank up at least two weeks in advance to make sure it's all running smoothly, and this just isn't possible for someone who's won a fish without being prepared for it.""","['Environment', 'RSPCA', 'Wales', 'Fish', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/863C/production/_125746343_gettyimages-131491177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F4/production/_125746350_gettyimages-88374868.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Catriona Aitken', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

Sir Jonathan Thompson said a rise in the cost of materials such as concrete and steel over the past few years have added £8bn to £10bn. In October the government cancelled the sections between the West Midlands, Manchester, and the East Midlands. Now HS2 Ltd and the government disagree on the cost of building the rest. The company's latest estimate for the London to Birmingham stretch is between £49bn and £56.6bn in 2019 prices. The government thinks it should be delivered at the lower end of £45bn to £54bn. These estimates were put together before October's announcement. However, Sir Jonathan does not believe £45bn is possible. He said the price tag might be lower without the taxpayer funding a new station at Euston, but doubted that would bring down the cost as much as the government stated. He said the budget given for the overall programme had been too low to begin with. ""The cost of delivery is more than the government budgeted, and that is before you begin to account for the extraordinary construction inflation over the last three years or so."" Labour said the new cost projections were a direct result of the prime minister's ""weak leadership and mismanagement of HS2"". ""As chief secretary, chancellor and now PM Rishi Sunak has allowed costs to soar and public money go down the drain. This is a government with no direction, no plan and no regard for taxpayers' money,"" shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said. HS2: End of the line? Watch on BBC iPlayer how the story of HS2 unfolded. Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) The firm's executive chair said HS2's costs had risen so much over the past decade because of poor cost estimating, changes to the project's scope, some poor delivery and the impact of inflation. He added that decisions to delay parts of the project for cashflow reasons, could end up meaning they cost more, and that the Covid pandemic had added £500m to £600m. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 trains will travel more slowly than existing Pendolino trains when they travel on conventional tracks between Birmingham and Manchester, because they cannot tilt on bends. He said he expects fewer seats to be available on HS2 north of Birmingham now the legs to Manchester and Crewe have been scrapped, due to trains having to be shorter to fit existing platforms. HS2 trains of the same length as the current Pendolinos would be used, but would have fewer seats. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 was waiting for the government to make decisions on certain aspects of the project, including the tunnel south from Old Oak Common to Euston. Development of the railway's terminus at London Euston will depend on investment from private developers, with plans to develop housing around the station. The site for a station at Euston has already been cleared, with residents and businesses forced out. Until the new station is built, HS2 will end at Old Oak Common in West London, meaning people would have to change trains to reach the capital's heart. The government has said there has been interest from developers. However, in a BBC interview in November, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, would not say how soon he wanted to have a firm commitment from investors, or a new station design - arguing that an ""artificial deadline"" could damage the government's negotiating hand. Mr Harper also could not say whether the tunnel taking trains from Old Oak Common to Euston would be paid for by private investors or the taxpayer. He told the BBC that this would depend on ""how much private sector money we can get in"", and he wanted to ""get the possible deal for taxpayers"". He maintained that bringing in the private sector would help the scheme be delivered on time and budget. The government claims getting private investors to pay for Euston will save £6.5bn. Mr Harper told the BBC this figure had been reached by converting the £4.8bn cost of the latest 10-platform station design into 2023 prices. But ministers had already said that design was unaffordable. Work on Euston was paused in March 2023, with the time to be used for developing an ""affordable and deliverable station design"". In November, HS2 Ltd confirmed it would continue the process of buying more than 200 homes and businesses along the scrapped Manchester route on advice from the government. The figure includes sales under ""blight"", where owners ask the government to buy their property at the price they would have been worth if an infrastructure project such as road or rail works had not lowered its market value. A spokesperson said at the time that such acquisitions may continue ""where the claimant wishes to proceed and there is a compelling case to do so"", including where applications were submitted before the government announcement. ""We have also identified a limited number of locations and properties where the compulsory purchase process is well advanced and needs to continue until it's completed,"" the spokesperson added. Meanwhile people whose land or properties had already been purchased have been left in limbo, as the government develops a plan for selling back land that's no longer needed. Ministers have said this will not be quick.

Twenty-one local authorities have already implemented the ban, while Powys council has confirmed it will be joining them. It comes as part of the RSPCA's No Fun At The Fair campaign, which is calling for regulation on events which have historically given animals as rewards. But the charity says an outright Welsh government ban is needed to prevent the practice happening on private land. Sioned Nikolic, RSPCA Cymru's public affairs officer, said: ""Only a few months ago we were calling on 10 local authorities to take action and now we have all councils in agreement that this will not be happening on their land."" But the ban does not mean the practice cannot continue on private land. ""We know that this is something people care about, with many assuming it is already banned,"" she said. ""We would ultimately like to see pets being given away as prizes banned outrightly by the Welsh government."" Since 2020, there have been 42 reports about pets being given as prizes made to the RSPCA, but the charity fears many incidents go unreported. Goldfish are the animal most commonly associated with prize-giving, but the RSPCA says they are easily stressed and very often fish that are won as prizes suffer miserably from shock and oxygen starvation or die prematurely from changes in water temperature. Ms Nikolic added: ""They're misunderstood pets as they can make great companions, but can actually be challenging to look after. New owners must do their research before they acquire the fish, not afterwards. ""Before bringing a fish home for the first time, it's important to set the tank up at least two weeks in advance to make sure it's all running smoothly, and this just isn't possible for someone who's won a fish without being prepared for it.""","['Environment', 'RSPCA', 'Wales', 'Fish', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/863C/production/_125746343_gettyimages-131491177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F4/production/_125746350_gettyimages-88374868.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Catriona Aitken', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67930783,Rishi Sunak facing major Tory revolt over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.,2024-01-10,"Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Over 30 backbenchers on the right of the party are backing plans to change the bill next week to make it harder for people to appeal deportation. The amendments underline the scale of Tory division over the policy, which the PM has made a priority. Ministers insist the bill allows only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. Those backing the amendments include former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and a clutch of former cabinet ministers, including former home secretary Suella Braverman. Ex-migration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the draft law last month and is a leading rebel, said the current bill would fail to prevent a ""merry-go-round"" of individual appeals. The Rwanda policy dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer arguing the prime minister had been ""taken hostage by his own party"". He added that reports over the weekend that he had doubts about the policy when he was chancellor showed Mr Sunak had been ""caught red handed"". ""He knows the Rwanda gimmick won't work - but he can't be honest about it because he's too scared of his own MPs,"" he added. In reply, the prime minister said the government would deliver on its promise to halt migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. Mr Sunak said Labour had not put forward a ""single practical idea"" to reduce illegal migration, and ""can never be trusted to stop the boats"". The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds. Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights. The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended. A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful. However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"". He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum. He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly. Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably. Ministers could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament. And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law. The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda. ""We need a bill with a respectable legal argument and one which does not collapse the scheme,"" they added.","['Robert Jenrick', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Rwanda']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/21F6/production/_131849680_71e87bb3-11d8-4f40-bd0f-8abcc9f442e0.jpg'],"['By Paul Seddon & Sam Francis', 'Politics reporters']",UK,Politics

Twenty-one local authorities have already implemented the ban, while Powys council has confirmed it will be joining them. It comes as part of the RSPCA's No Fun At The Fair campaign, which is calling for regulation on events which have historically given animals as rewards. But the charity says an outright Welsh government ban is needed to prevent the practice happening on private land. Sioned Nikolic, RSPCA Cymru's public affairs officer, said: ""Only a few months ago we were calling on 10 local authorities to take action and now we have all councils in agreement that this will not be happening on their land."" But the ban does not mean the practice cannot continue on private land. ""We know that this is something people care about, with many assuming it is already banned,"" she said. ""We would ultimately like to see pets being given away as prizes banned outrightly by the Welsh government."" Since 2020, there have been 42 reports about pets being given as prizes made to the RSPCA, but the charity fears many incidents go unreported. Goldfish are the animal most commonly associated with prize-giving, but the RSPCA says they are easily stressed and very often fish that are won as prizes suffer miserably from shock and oxygen starvation or die prematurely from changes in water temperature. Ms Nikolic added: ""They're misunderstood pets as they can make great companions, but can actually be challenging to look after. New owners must do their research before they acquire the fish, not afterwards. ""Before bringing a fish home for the first time, it's important to set the tank up at least two weeks in advance to make sure it's all running smoothly, and this just isn't possible for someone who's won a fish without being prepared for it.""","['Environment', 'RSPCA', 'Wales', 'Fish', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/863C/production/_125746343_gettyimages-131491177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F4/production/_125746350_gettyimages-88374868.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Catriona Aitken', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67940193,Can scheme to quash Post Office convictions work?,The government's plan to clear the names of hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the Post Office Horizon software scandal is truly unprecedented.,2024-01-10,"The government's plan to clear the names of hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the Post Office Horizon software scandal is truly unprecedented. It will be some weeks before the legislation is presented to Parliament, but we have a pretty clear idea of what the headlines translate to - and why, on a much deeper level, it represents a constitutional leap into the dark, albeit for a noble cause. In short, the Bill won't list name-by-name the individuals that the government proposes to clear of wrongdoing. There will be no long schedule of the innocent read out in the Houses of Parliament. Instead, the Bill will be a mechanism that declares that anyone found guilty of a Post Office scandal-related offence, during a specific time frame, will have their conviction quashed as soon as the legislation receives Royal Assent. In other words, exoneration will be a truly automatic process: no declaration in an appeal court, vindicating the innocent. Scotland, which runs a different legal system, is also planning a similar law. A blanket exoneration also means ministers have decided Parliament should, without considering the individual facts, overturn convictions of any one who was genuinely guilty. Faced with a moral dilemma of how to best see speedy justice done for the innocent, the government has made a political choice to live with that consequence. Policy officials and government lawyers have an awful lot to work though in the coming weeks to make the plan a reality. For a start, they have to work out how to make sure that UK criminal records are swiftly expunged and that there is a robust and trusted bureaucratic record of who has been exonerated. Ministers must also decide what to do with the small number of individuals who have so far failed in attempted appeals. It is not clear at present whether the legislation will need to deal with around 50 cases rejected by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the official miscarriages body that refused to send those appeals back to judges. Assuming all those issues can be solved, quashing the convictions then unlocks the door to compensation. The government has a standing offer of £600,000 to anyone who has their conviction quashed in relation to the scandal - but that money won't be paid out automatically once the Bill becomes law. Nobody cleared under the plan will receive that cash until they sign a declaration that they definitely were not guilty. That declaration will basically act as a promise they have not done anything wrong. And that means that anyone who was genuinely guilty could be later prosecuted for attempting to defraud the government by taking advantage of the scheme. This sounds neat in practice because it tries to minimise the risk of repeat fraud. But the question is whether some of those who are genuinely innocent have enough trust in the state to sign the form, given they may fear being wrongfully convicted again. The only realistic alternative to all of this was to find some way to speed up the Court of Appeals process. The former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, told the BBC earlier this week that the courts could handle the workload. There are, for instance, recently retired highly experienced Court of Appeal judges who could help run the cases in large batches. Serving judges don't comment on Parliament and politics - but there is a lot of nervousness in the legal world from which they are drawn. Constitutionally, Parliament and politicians have no business interfering with the decisions of courts - that is how power is separated and balanced in the UK. This plan tips that delicate balance. ""What we have is Parliament seizing from the courts and the judges the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty,"" Lord Ken MacDonald, the former Director of Public Prosecutions told The BBC. ""And the problem is that once this dam is burst - we can all see it's being done for the best of reasons here - who's to say how such a process might be used in the future?"" Will another government, on another day, be once again tempted to override the independent courts? The government will be under pressure to make sure that this legislation is truly a one-off exceptional step to correct the most exceptional injustice in British legal history.","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4F03/production/_132272202_gettyimages-93286126.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']",,UK,Politics

Millie-Rae, 11, has been home-educated by her mum Seana-lee in Merthyr Tydfil, since September. She is one of 5,330 children in Wales not being taught in school - the highest number on record. The Welsh government said it recognised the right of parents to teach their own children, but, in most cases, children were best served by attending school. Seana-lee originally took Millie-Rae out of school during the pandemic as she felt he daughter was not being provided with enough work. But within a few months of returning, she fell behind as she was struggling with the school environment, her mother said. When Millie-Rae began secondary school in September, she lasted just five days before refusing to go. Seana-lee said: ""Her confidence was slipping and she was starting not to go out with friends. She was getting tearful and stressed about not wanting to go back in. ""Her whole behaviour is totally different when she's in school."" Millie-Rae has recently been referred by a GP for ADHD investigations and struggled concentrating in a large, loud classroom. Seana-lee said: ""She lives in a daydream, which can be frustrating sometimes. She's very ditsy but also very clever. School didn't suit her as she needs that one-to-one attention. ""Home is a safe environment for her - she can fidget all she likes and as long as she's learning then I'm happy."" Seana-lee said she was nervous to homeschool Millie-Rae because her family were against it. ""You have to have thick skin to do this, it's not been easy,"" she said. ""Homeschooling has definitely brought her out of her shell and has given her the confidence I think she needed."" Millie-Rae said although she misses seeing her friends regularly, she goes to a weekly drama group to keep up her social life. ""Homeschooling is helping me to live and be happy. Finally, my mental health and my anxiety feels calmer,"" she said. Latest figures show that, from September 2022 to August 2023, 5,330 children were registered as being homeschooled in Wales, compared to 2,626 five years ago. There were fewer than 900 children identified as having their education at home a decade ago. Of the 22 councils in Wales, 17 have seen an increase with Carmarthenshire the highest - up from 457 two years before to 739. Figures may be inflated due to greater attempts from councils to find and record families who have opted against school. Victoria Williams, director of Smart Education Wales, a tuition centre based in Bridgend and Newport, said Covid was one of the main reasons behind the rise. ""Many are now suffering with mental health issues and social anxiety. They are struggling to fit back into society,"" she said. ""Children are also behind educationally and I think a lot of parents enjoyed the lockdowns and realised that they had the ability to educate their children themselves."" A Welsh government spokesman said about 1% of children in Wales were educated this way. ""The home educator's handbook provides advice to parents and carers who are home educating, or considering doing so,"" they added. ""We have also worked with every local authority to make sure that the most appropriate provision can be identified and put in place for each child.""","['Anxiety', 'Wales', 'Merthyr Tydfil', 'Mental health', 'Welsh government', 'Home education', 'Homeschooling']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D093/production/_132259335_mediaitem132086729.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/183D6/production/_132268299_homeschoolfamily.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135B6/production/_132268297_millieraeschool.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E885/production/_132252595_mediaitem132252590.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/C175/production/_132252594_mediaitem132252593.jpg']","['By Eleri Griffiths', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

More than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted across the UK, including up to 100 in Scotland, after wrongly being accused of embezzling money. Humza Yousaf said he would work with Westminster to ensure victims across the UK are exonerated. Mr Yousaf said people had already had to wait too long for justice. Although it has been public knowledge for years with an inquiry ongoing, the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. The first minister was speaking after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced plans to introduce a new law that will quash convictions in England and Wales. The legislation would not normally affect Scotland, but Mr Yousaf said he was open to using a Legislative Consent Motion that would allow it to also apply north of the border. Mr Yousaf added that those affected ""can be absolutely assured"" they will be pardoned. A Legislative Consent Motion would be the ""easiest and fastest"" solution, the first minister added. He stressed other options were also possible. Post Office branch managers were accused of wrongdoing based on information from the faulty computer system between 1999 and 2015, with charges including theft and fraud. However while in England the Post Office acted as prosecutor, in Scotland all cases were the responsibility of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). Only two Scottish cases have been overturned so far but the Crown Office estimated up to 100 Scottish cases may be affected. Mr Yousaf said: ""The Post Office absolutely have to be held to account. It is important that we get the answers for those who have waited far too long for justice."" In a letter sent from Mr Yousaf to the prime minister, he stated: ""Given the unique circumstances arising from the Post Office Horizon scandal, it is right that normal processes for appeals are set aside to ensure that justice can now be delivered for those whose lives were greatly impacted by their wrongful conviction."" BBC Scotland News previously reported that the Crown Office knew about potential problems with the  Horizon IT system in May 2013. Asked if this had been raised with him when he served as justice secretary, Mr Yousaf said: ""I don't recall anybody getting in touch with me directly"". Louise Dar was forced to pay £44,000 which was wrongly deemed to have gone missing from her sub-post office in Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire. Although not convicted of a crime, she told BBC Scotland News the experience was ""soul-destroying"" for her and her husband. The couple eventually lost the sub-post office - and their shop where it was based - due to the claims. Ms Dar ""won't hold her breath"" regarding future compensation but she hopes the Scottish government will now support those affected. She added: ""The criminal convictions to be quashed, that's amazing work, but for everybody compensation needs to happen."" Myra Philp and her mother Mary ran a post office branch in Auchtermuchty, Fife. In 2007 Mary Philp was suspended over missing funds, but due to her age she was not prosecuted. She died in 2018, before the first case was overturned, and her daughter stated that she has only been offered a ""derisory"" amount of compensation since then. Myra Philp told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live: ""Today's decision is amazingly wonderful, but I haven't heard about the people who weren't convicted, and there were about 3,000 of them. ""We lost everything. We lost the premises. We lost our reputation. We lost our investment. We lost the earnings we would have had going forward. ""Emotionally, it was like a virtual prison sentence except without having your day in court."" Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Angela Constance has said she will speak with fellow ministers about the Scottish government's ongoing Fujitsu contracts. The Japanese company signed a deal in 2020 to support electronic vote counts for Scotland's local elections. The UK government has said Fujitsu - which has apologised for its role in the post office scandal - would be ""held accountable"" if it was found to have blundered in its handling of the affair. Fujitsu's website says the company has over 200 staff located in Scotland, and lists its customers as including the Scottish government and UK government departments based in Scotland.","['Scottish government', 'Humza Yousaf', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A601/production/_130879424_postoffice.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F379/production/_131592326_humza-pa.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FC67/production/_123251646_maryp.jpg']",,UK,Politics

The Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce has compared 33 similarly wealthy nations in a survival league table. Wales ranks 32nd for stomach cancer, 31st for pancreatic and lung, 21st for liver and oesophageal and 12th for brain. The Welsh government said it is committed to improving cancer outcomes. The taskforce - a partnership of cancer charities including Tenovus Cancer Care - suggests Wales and the rest of the UK rank below most other countries for five-year survival rates. South Korea, Belgium, the United States, Australia and China were the countries that scored the highest. The six deadliest cancers are lung, liver, brain, oesophageal, pancreatic and stomach. More than 90,000 people are diagnosed with one of these six in the UK every year, and they account for 67,000 deaths - about half all cancer deaths. The chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, Judi Rhys, said people with these cancers had a ""shockingly low life expectancy"". Ms Rhys, who is also chairwoman of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce Wales subgroup, said: ""The actions we've repeatedly called for - targeted screening and monitoring those most at risk - would have a huge impact on survival. ""These latest statistics should be a strong reminder to Welsh government of the importance of prioritising and accelerating cancer survival initiatives."" She said ""exciting developments going on"" included a breath test that helps detect pancreatic cancer, which she wants more research done on. ""Similarly some of the tests that can be used for things like Barrett's oesophagus - which is the precursor often to throat cancer - we have some very simple, well tolerated tools that can be used which would be able to detect those cancers earlier. ""We're not rolling those out across Wales at the moment and that is a real concern to us."" About 15,400 people survive five years in the UK but, if rates were the same as the best performing countries, that could be as many as 23,775 people. The taskforce's report suggests delayed diagnosis and slow access to treatment could be to blame. Many patients were only diagnosed after an emergency admission to hospital or an urgent referral after their symptoms become severe. The Wales Cancer Network published a three-year cancer improvement plan last year, including plans for rapid diagnostic centres. The most recent NHS performance figures showed 56% of patients were treated within the target 62-days of cancer being suspected. The Welsh government said cancer is one of the six planning priorities for the NHS and it is committed to improving cancer outcomes.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokeswoman said on Wednesday it would be ""common sense"" to honour him after a mass quashing of convictions was announced. Mr Bates is said have refused an OBE while ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells still held a CBE. She received that in 2019, in spite of the scandal. MPs and campaigners have called for Mr Bates' honour to be re-submitted now Ms Vennells has agreed to relinquish her's in the face of a public outcry. There have also been a number of online petitions calling for Mr Bates, from Llandudno, Conwy, to be honoured, one of which has more than 80,000 signatures. The scandal has been brought to the fore by ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. It lasted from 1999 and 2015 and saw 736 sub-postmasters unfairly prosecuted due to a faulty IT system Senior minister Esther McVey said she wanted to see Mr Bates knighted ""as soon as possible"". ""Anybody can nominate him and I'm quite sure we will see Sir Alan as soon as possible,"" the Tory MP told GB News. The prime minister's press secretary argued it was ""hard to think of someone more deserving of being rewarded through the honours system than him"". Asked if she agreed with Ms McVey about the knighthood the official said: ""That sounds like common sense."" But Mr Bates told BBC Radio 4's World at One it was ""not about me"". ""It's about the whole group, and it's about getting this money out to people as soon as possible, so they can try and get on with their lives and try and put this behind them,"" he said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also backed the move. His spokesman said: ""Alan Bates clearly has emerged as a hero throughout this for the way in which he has led the campaign, the fortitude and resolve he was shown given everything that has been thrown at him throughout this process.

Transport minister Lee Waters said Phil Jones, who chaired a task force on 20mph and whose company advised on the legislation, is leading the exercise. Welsh Conservatives accused the Welsh government of marking its own homework. The Welsh government said Mr Jones is ""well-placed to assess whether clarifications... are needed"". It said the review will look at the implementation of the policy, rather than the policy itself. Plaid Cymru said the review should be independent of those who played any part in the legislation. The exercise is expected to look at how councils draw up 30mph exceptions to the limit. The Welsh government has said for months it would hold a review, which has been backed by the two ministers running to replace Mark Drakeford - Vaughan Gething and Jeremy Miles. In the Senedd on Wednesday afternoon Mr Waters said: ""I've asked Phil Jones, who's leading the review for us, to consider whether further tweaks to the guidance on exceptions would be helpful, for example, by explicitly including major bus routes as one of the local criteria they can consider."" Mr Jones led a task force group formed by Mr Waters in 2019, which said a default 20mph speed limit should be introduced ""as quickly as possible"". It made recommendations about how Welsh ministers should introduce the law, which came into effect last September. A Freedom of Information Act request said that Phil Jones Associates, his company, was engaged by Welsh government to offer advice on the legislation. After the Senedd voted, in July 2020, in favour of a national default 20mph speed limit, Mr Jones issued a press release saying he was ""naturally delighted"". ""A 20mph speed limit will mean safer streets and will also encourage more walking and cycling for everyday journeys - which is especially important during the Covid-19 pandemic where people are being discouraged from using public transport,"" he said. On Monday the first minister Mr Drakeford accepted that the policy needed to be fine-tuned because of inconsistencies in approach between different councils. Mr Waters has said that the proportion of roads still at 30mph varied greatly between councils - ""from over 10% in Swansea and Bridgend, to under one per cent in four north Wales authorities."" Natasha Asghar, Conservative shadow transport minister, said: ""The Welsh government is marking its own homework on the hugely unpopular 20mph speed limit. ""Surely the same people who recommended the Welsh government should implement this policy should not be leading the review into it, as it will hardly be impartial and a true reflection of reality."" A Plaid Cymru spokesman said: ""This appointment will no doubt be seen by many as Welsh government wanting to play judge and jury. For its own credibility the review should be independent of those who played any part with the legislation."" ""We need detail about how this review will be conducted, and how it intends to ensure that the further necessary exemptions are implemented promptly."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""This review, as we set out in October, is looking at how the new default 20mph speed limit has been implemented across Wales. It is not a review into the policy itself which has been overwhelmingly supported by Senedd members from three parties. ""As Phil Jones - a highly regarded transport planner and engineer - chaired the Welsh 20mph task force group, he is well-placed to assess whether clarifications in the policy are needed to encourage greater consistency.""","['Wales', 'Lee Waters', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16A3D/production/_125833729_20signcaldy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1639D/production/_132273019_mediaitem132273018.jpg']","['By David Deans & Gareth Lewis', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Politics

Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey, was locked up for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. Upon hearing that new legislation is to be rushed in to quash convictions he said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"". He added he has been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru has called for a review of any contracts held by the Welsh government with Fujitsu - the Japanese company whose system was at the heart of the scandal. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Sunak revealed the UK government is to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal - it lasted from 1999 and 2015 and saw 736 sub-postmasters unfairly prosecuted due to a faulty IT system. More than 700 branch managers were given criminal convictions, only 93 of which have so far been overturned. Described in Prime Minister's Questions as a ""huge injustice"" by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, the scandal has recently been highlighted in the acclaimed ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. ""We will wait to see the small print because we have been promised a hell of a lot over the last 18 years and we have been set back,"" said Mr Thomas of the prime minister's announcement. ""So I'm not quite convinced, but if it does help fellow sub-postmasters up and down the country, it's sorely needed."" Mr Thomas, who finally had his conviction quashed in 2021, described the last few weeks as ""a whirlwind"". ""It's taken a TV drama like this to bring it home to the public,"" he said. After spending 13 weeks in prison for crime he did not commit, Mr Thomas added: ""I honestly did struggle for the first three years until I was told by a BBC journalist Sion Tecwyn that there were others like me also involved. ""And there are friends of mine across the country who have had it worse than me."" He said: ""I just hope he (Rishi Sunak) keeps to his word because we have heard promises before, only for things to then be put back in the drawer. ""I don't know why it's taken this long to do the right thing."" The business and trade minister has also apologised directly to Mr Thomas, when questioned by Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts in the Commons. Kevin Hollinrake said: ""Can I on behalf of the Government and the Post Office apologise for what happened to Mr Thomas. ""It was such a moving story and I think anyone watching would have been moved to tears by what happened to him and others."" Asked later whether he would meet with Mr Thomas if asked, Mr Hollinrake added he'd be ""delighted to"".","['Wales', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Liz Saville-Roberts', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9B10/production/_118169693_po_pa.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/64A8/production/_132186752_mr_bates_vs_the_post_office_03.jpg']","['By Nathan Bevan', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67933785,"Scandal-hit S4C needs new chair, say Welsh MPs","The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said.",2024-01-10,"The scandal-hit Welsh language broadcaster S4C needs a new chair, a cross-party group of MPs has said. MPs on the Welsh Affairs Committee said they were ""concerned"" by evidence given by the organisation's current chairman Rhodri Williams, on Wednesday. They accused the channel's board of an ""absence of cultural leadership"". Mr Williams' term ends on 1 April - it is up to UK Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to reinstate him, or appoint his replacement. Committee chairman Stephen Crabb told BBC Wales that Mr Williams should not be reappointed in April, rather than immediately replaced. S4C has been in turmoil after a string of bullying allegations and the sacking of two officers, including the chief executive. Both have denied accusations made of them. In committee on Wednesday, Mr Crabb accused Mr Williams of acting as ""judge, jury and executioner"" in his actions last autumn. The MP was speaking in relation to S4C chief executive Sian Doyle, who was sacked in November after bullying allegations which she denies were investigated by a law firm. Mr Williams clarified that the decision to dismiss Ms Doyle was made by S4C's board, but said he had personally sacked Llinos Griffin-Williams, a decision ratified by the board later. Former chief content officer Ms Griffin-Williams had allegedly criticising ex-Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips's Welsh language skills in Nantes during the Rugby World Cup. She denies this and has threatened legal action against S4C. Mr Williams defended his actions to MPs, saying they were in ""the best interest of the staff"", and that he would be ""very happy"" to continue for a second term as chair. In a letter to Ms Frazer, committee chairman and Conservative MP Stephen Crabb says: ""We are concerned at the approach Mr Williams and the board took in seeking advice and reaching assurance in relation to key decisions it made. Mr Crabb added that the committee was ""not satisfied by the assurances from Mr Williams"" and lead non-executive board member Chris Jones ""that the different complaints made against specific individuals had been handled equitably and with proper consideration of the fair treatment of all those involved"". He said the committee was ""concerned about the ability of the current leadership to oversee the changes required"". ""Given the importance of S4C and the scale of the challenges with respect to improving governance and culture within the organisation, we recommend that the government appoint a new chair to take this work forward,"" Mr Crabb added. At the committee session, Mr Williams said that the board had ""acted effectively and quickly"" once they were aware of the problem at the channel and put in place a process which ""gave safety and security"" to staff who wanted to speak up. Capital Law was commissioned to hold an investigation after a letter from the Bectu union claimed there was a ""culture of fear"" among staff. In the Cardiff law firm's report, participants said that Ms Doyle's leadership style was ""dictatorial, creating a culture of fear"". Mr Williams told the MPs that the report provided a ""damning indictment of the leadership culture"" over the last two years, which he claimed ""got even worse"" once the investigation was underway. ""Capital Law makes it very clear where responsibility for that lies, I don't think it is with me or the board,"" he said. The report, Mr Williams said, makes clear that the chief executive, Ms Doyle, acted in a ""confrontational, inconsiderate and abusive manner, and that is where the failure has been"". As a result, he says, the non-executive members of the board ""acted decisively and quickly to terminate the chief executive's employment"". ""I am confident that it was the right decision, and that we have done the best in the interest of the staff of S4C and also in the interest of the organisation as a whole,"" he added. Mr Crabb questioned whether the two senior leaders were treated fairly, compared to complaints made against the chair Mr Williams. Mr Jones said the accusations were ""of a very different nature and very different circumstances"" and that he believed that all cases have been dealt with in an ""appropriate manner"". Discussing the dismissal of Ms Griffin-Williams, Mr Williams said her actions ""created immediate detrimental effect to the reputation of S4C"" and that he had no doubt that what happened constituted ""gross misconduct"". Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake also raised concerns that neither Ms Doyle or Ms Griffin-Williams had received advance sight of the Capital Law report, despite being criticised in it. Although S4C has been without a permanent chief executive since November, chairman Rhodri Williams confirmed that the process to find a replacement for Sian Doyle had not started. He said there was ""no timeline for recruitment"", but that ""sooner rather than later would be best"". Mr Williams became S4C's chairman in 2020. Asked, by Mr Crabb, if it might be better for the channel to ""move on with new leadership"" in the role, Mr Williams replied: ""That's certainly not what I'm told by members of staff or by members of the production community."" The decision on whether he will be offered a second term was a matter for the culture secretary, he told the committee. Ms Doyle has said she does not ""recognise or accept the allegations made"" about her time at the Welsh language broadcaster.","['Wales', 'S4C', 'Welsh language', 'Stephen Crabb', 'Lucy Frazer']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C7A/production/_114922967_20201014_rhodri_williams_9758.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/462E/production/_132266971_mediaitem129577093.jpg']","['By Elliw Gwawr, Adrian Browne and David Deans', 'BBC Wales']",UK,Politics

She also refused to say whether the party would help Gerry Kelly pay costs from his failed libel case against writer Malachi O'Doherty. Mr Kelly sued over interviews in which it was said he had shot a prison officer during an escape in 1983. Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to decide whether to take a case. ""It's not about Sinn Féin supporting these cases,"" she added. ""It's about individuals defending their own names."" When asked whether Sinn Féin would contribute to Mr Kelly's legal costs, Ms O'Neill said it is for individuals to defend their own cases. When asked again, she said her previous response had answered the question. DUP assembly member David Brooks has called on Sinn Féin to answer ""categorically"" if it will be making any contribution towards the cost of the libel case brought by Mr Kelly. ""The truth will emerge which it becomes clear who is picking up the tab for Gerry Kelly's case as he will have his own legal costs as well as those of Dr O'Doherty,"" he added. The High Court in Belfast struck out Mr Kelly's case, describing it as ""scandalous, frivolous and vexatious"". The ruling went on to characterise Mr Kelly's case as what is known as a Slapp action - Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. It stated that on balance, the proceedings ""were initiated not for the genuine purposes of vindicating a reputation injured by defamatory statements, but rather for the purpose of stifling the voices of Mr Kelly's troublesome critics"". The case was one of a number of recent libel actions taken by Sinn Féin representatives against journalists and political opponents. Ms O'Neill herself took a case against a DUP councillor last year, but was awarded no damages as the judge said the comments were misogynistic but not defamatory. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said that ""everybody's entitled to defend their good name"". ""And if you feel if you've been defamed at any time then you are entitled as the law says to take a case, and I commend that to anybody who feels that's where they need to be,"" she said. ""I'm the Sinn Féin vice-president, I'm a senior member of the party, and I can assure you there is no joined-up, concerted effort to silence anybody - but I do defend anybody's right to defend their own name."" Mr Kelly, an assembly member for north Belfast, said the ruling, published on Monday, was a ""substantive judgement,"" which he would study with his lawyer. He was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze prison near Lisburn. During the break-out, prison officer John Adams was shot in the head. Mr Kelly has never admitted shooting him and was found not guilty at a trial in 1987. Mr Kelly had claimed Dr O'Doherty's comments, made in 2019, had gravely damaged his reputation and brought his standing as an assembly member into disrepute. However, Dr O'Doherty pointed out that the prison officer had claimed Mr Kelly fired the shot. He also argued there was no damage to Mr Kelly's reputation, as he had served prison sentences for the 1973 Old Bailey bombings and he is someone publicly identified as a former IRA member. Mr Kelly has also written books which deal with the escape, although they conceal who fired the shot. In the ruling, Master Evan Bell stated: ""What Mr Kelly has written in his books, in my view, makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to rebut the argument that he was not a joint tortfeasor in respect of the battery. ""Even if one accepts Mr Kelly has not explicitly admitted pulling the trigger, the content of his books appears to make Mr Kelly civilly liable, on the balance of probabilities, for the shooting of Mr Adams. ""In the light of that, these defamation proceedings against Dr O'Doherty are completely untenable. ""For that reason the court strikes them out on the basis that they are scandalous, frivolous and vexatious.""","['Belfast', 'Sinn Féin', ""Michelle O'Neill""]","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18532/production/_131643699_gettyimages-1255673174-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F41/production/_132252858_gettyimages-488147039-1.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1D65/production/_132252570_malachio'doherty02.jpg""]","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,Politics

The Japanese-owned IT company provided the system at the heart of the Post Office scandal. The party's leader Rhun ap Iorwerth asked whether the company was ""fit"" to have contracts with the government. The Welsh government has been asked to confirm whether a review will take place and how many contracts it holds. Fujitsu has said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Meanwhile Labour MS Jack Sergeant criticised an upfront compensation payment to sub-postmasters of £75,000 as ""not good enough"". In the Senedd on Wednesday Mr ap Iorwerth said he was aware that the Welsh government had had dealings with the company, including a five year support and maintenance contract for Transport for Wales. He asked Deputy Minister Hannah Blythyn for an update on the number of active contracts the Welsh government held with Fujitsu. He added: ""Could the minister tell us how the concerns regarding their [Fujitsu's] involvement in the Horizon scandal were taken into consideration before they were awarded Welsh government contracts? ""What additional due diligence will be applied to the government's relationship with Fujitsu now and in the future as a result of the public understanding of the scale of the scandal that Fujitsu was involved in? ""Are they fit to have contracts with Welsh government: is Welsh government comfortable having contracts with a company at the heart of such a scandal?"" Ms Blythyn said she did not have the number of contracts at her ""fingertips"" but would come back to the Senedd with more detail. Earlier, answering a Topical Question from Mr Sergeant, Ms Blythyn had told MSs that Counsel General Mick Antoniw - the Welsh government's top legal advisor - would shortly be meeting the other UK nations to discuss the miscarriage of justice and the ""fundamental changes needed to ensure the rule of law is more than just a soundbite"".

Funding for a childcare scheme has been cut by the Welsh government in an attempt to direct more money to frontline public services. The government says demand for care had been lower than expected. But the Women's Equality Network (WEN) charity said it was the ""wrong reaction"". The gender-equality group said the government should instead make sure families can access the service. In October, Finance Minister Rebecca Evans revealed cuts mid-way through the financial year so more funding could be switched to the NHS and rail operator Transport for Wales. It included a cut of £16.1m to the childcare offer which provides 30-hours of care a week for three and four-year-olds. The government said the money was available after updated forecasts of demand from parents. Another £11.2m will be taken out of the policy next year, again based on the latest forecasts, with the government saying it will have ""no anticipated direct impact to delivery"". But Jessica Laimann of WEN said the reduced demand was ""most likely a mismatch between what families need and what is actually available"". ""Cutting the budget is certainly the wrong reaction to that,"" she told the Senedd's finance committee. Research by Oxfam Cymru last year showed a ""critical need for affordable childcare in Wales"", she said. She added: ""High childcare costs are compounding the financial pressures for families, pushing parents - especially single mothers - into debt and poverty."" She also said women were more likely to work in and rely on care services. ""So if we are still seeing cuts to these provisions women are likely to bear the brunt of that."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The childcare offer is a demand-led programme and support is made available for all eligible parents that apply.

Over 30 backbenchers on the right of the party are backing plans to change the bill next week to make it harder for people to appeal deportation. The amendments underline the scale of Tory division over the policy, which the PM has made a priority. Ministers insist the bill allows only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. Those backing the amendments include former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and a clutch of former cabinet ministers, including former home secretary Suella Braverman. Ex-migration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the draft law last month and is a leading rebel, said the current bill would fail to prevent a ""merry-go-round"" of individual appeals. The Rwanda policy dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer arguing the prime minister had been ""taken hostage by his own party"". He added that reports over the weekend that he had doubts about the policy when he was chancellor showed Mr Sunak had been ""caught red handed"". ""He knows the Rwanda gimmick won't work - but he can't be honest about it because he's too scared of his own MPs,"" he added. In reply, the prime minister said the government would deliver on its promise to halt migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. Mr Sunak said Labour had not put forward a ""single practical idea"" to reduce illegal migration, and ""can never be trusted to stop the boats"". The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds. Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights. The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended. A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful. However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"". He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum. He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly. Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably. Ministers could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament. And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law. The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda. ""We need a bill with a respectable legal argument and one which does not collapse the scheme,"" they added.","['Robert Jenrick', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Rwanda']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/21F6/production/_131849680_71e87bb3-11d8-4f40-bd0f-8abcc9f442e0.jpg'],"['By Paul Seddon & Sam Francis', 'Politics reporters']",UK,Politics

More than 700 sub-postmasters were prosecuted across the UK, including up to 100 in Scotland, after wrongly being accused of embezzling money. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced a new law that will quash the convictions of all victims of the scandal in England and Wales. But it will not apply in Scotland. Downing Street has said it will work with the Scottish government to ensure sub-postmasters north of the border can also be cleared. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We want to work with relevant bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland on this matter. It is not something we can do cross-UK."" Angela Constance, Scotland's justice secretary, is currently considering how best to clear those who were pursued through the Scottish courts. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland ahead of the prime minister's announcement, she said: ""We recognise that the UK Horizon Post Office scandal as probably one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in our time across the UK. ""We want to play our part in standing up for those who have been impacted by this travesty in Scotland."" Ms Constance has also written to the UK justice secretary, Alex Chalk, seeking an urgent meeting to ensure any Scottish legislation would not have the unintended consequence of excluding sub-postmasters from the UK compensation scheme. At the moment, it appears that the scheme is only accessible to those who are cleared by the appeal courts or were among those who reached a group settlement with the Post Office in 2019. Holyrood has previously passed legislation pardoning gay and bisexual men with historic convictions for same sex relations and pardoning miners for convictions related to strike action in the 1980s. It is possible these laws could offer a model for pardoning sub-postmasters wrongly convicted for fraud and embezzlement in Scotland, if the Scottish and UK governments can agree a way to ensure that does not inadvertently block their route to compensation. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) had sole responsibility for prosecuting Horizon cases in Scotland, with only two convictions having been overturned so far. First Minister Humza Yousaf has previously backed calls for the mass exoneration of victims of the Post Office scandal. Post Office branch managers were accused of wrongdoing based on information from the faulty computer system between 1999 and 2015 The charges included false accounting, theft and fraud. Some of those convicted were jailed, while others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Others have since died. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) wrote to 73 potential victims in Scotland in 2020 but only 16 have come forward to have their convictions quashed. Six people were then given permission by the SCCRC to appeal Horizon convictions in court but only two have been overturned so far. The other four are still awaiting an outcome. Although it has been public knowledge for years with an inquiry ongoing, the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. It has emerged that the COPFS became aware of potential problems with the Horizon system - the faulty Fujitsu software for the Post Office which made it look made look as though money was missing - a decade ago. Ms Constance has said she will speak with fellow ministers about the Scottish government's ongoing Fujitsu contracts. The Japanese company signed a deal in 2020 to support electronic vote counts for Scotland's local elections. The UK government has said Fujitsu - which has apologised for its role in the post office scandal - would be ""held accountable"" if it was found to have blundered in its handling of the affair. Fujitsu's website says the company has over 200 staff located in Scotland, and lists its customers as including the Scottish government and UK government departments based in Scotland.","['Scottish government', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/985F/production/_132270093_23d0f9dfaee0f225624723b62d1e68a69a405f06.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/07A4/production/_132265910_2d5cd85628a98848b322847d2ca7548210b15f38.jpg']",,UK,Politics

Twenty-one local authorities have already implemented the ban, while Powys council has confirmed it will be joining them. It comes as part of the RSPCA's No Fun At The Fair campaign, which is calling for regulation on events which have historically given animals as rewards. But the charity says an outright Welsh government ban is needed to prevent the practice happening on private land. Sioned Nikolic, RSPCA Cymru's public affairs officer, said: ""Only a few months ago we were calling on 10 local authorities to take action and now we have all councils in agreement that this will not be happening on their land."" But the ban does not mean the practice cannot continue on private land. ""We know that this is something people care about, with many assuming it is already banned,"" she said. ""We would ultimately like to see pets being given away as prizes banned outrightly by the Welsh government."" Since 2020, there have been 42 reports about pets being given as prizes made to the RSPCA, but the charity fears many incidents go unreported. Goldfish are the animal most commonly associated with prize-giving, but the RSPCA says they are easily stressed and very often fish that are won as prizes suffer miserably from shock and oxygen starvation or die prematurely from changes in water temperature.

Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67930783,Rishi Sunak facing major Tory revolt over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.,2024-01-10,"Rishi Sunak is facing a significant rebellion from Tory MPs over legislation to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Over 30 backbenchers on the right of the party are backing plans to change the bill next week to make it harder for people to appeal deportation. The amendments underline the scale of Tory division over the policy, which the PM has made a priority. Ministers insist the bill allows only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. Those backing the amendments include former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and a clutch of former cabinet ministers, including former home secretary Suella Braverman. Ex-migration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the draft law last month and is a leading rebel, said the current bill would fail to prevent a ""merry-go-round"" of individual appeals. The Rwanda policy dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer arguing the prime minister had been ""taken hostage by his own party"". He added that reports over the weekend that he had doubts about the policy when he was chancellor showed Mr Sunak had been ""caught red handed"". ""He knows the Rwanda gimmick won't work - but he can't be honest about it because he's too scared of his own MPs,"" he added. In reply, the prime minister said the government would deliver on its promise to halt migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. Mr Sunak said Labour had not put forward a ""single practical idea"" to reduce illegal migration, and ""can never be trusted to stop the boats"". The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds. Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights. The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended. A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful. However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"". He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum. He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly. Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably. Ministers could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament. And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law. The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda. ""We need a bill with a respectable legal argument and one which does not collapse the scheme,"" they added.","['Robert Jenrick', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Rwanda']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/21F6/production/_131849680_71e87bb3-11d8-4f40-bd0f-8abcc9f442e0.jpg'],"['By Paul Seddon & Sam Francis', 'Politics reporters']",UK,Politics

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67932247,"HS2 to Birmingham may cost £65bn, railway boss says","The London to Birmingham stretch of the HS2 railway could cost more than £65bn in current prices, the boss of the company building it has said.",2024-01-10,"The London to Birmingham stretch of the HS2 railway could cost more than £65bn in current prices, the boss of the company building it has said. Sir Jonathan Thompson said a rise in the cost of materials such as concrete and steel over the past few years have added £8bn to £10bn. In October the government cancelled the sections between the West Midlands, Manchester, and the East Midlands. Now HS2 Ltd and the government disagree on the cost of building the rest. The company's latest estimate for the London to Birmingham stretch is between £49bn and £56.6bn in 2019 prices. The government thinks it should be delivered at the lower end of £45bn to £54bn. These estimates were put together before October's announcement. However, Sir Jonathan does not believe £45bn is possible. He said the price tag might be lower without the taxpayer funding a new station at Euston, but doubted that would bring down the cost as much as the government stated. He said the budget given for the overall programme had been too low to begin with. ""The cost of delivery is more than the government budgeted, and that is before you begin to account for the extraordinary construction inflation over the last three years or so."" Labour said the new cost projections were a direct result of the prime minister's ""weak leadership and mismanagement of HS2"". ""As chief secretary, chancellor and now PM Rishi Sunak has allowed costs to soar and public money go down the drain. This is a government with no direction, no plan and no regard for taxpayers' money,"" shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said. HS2: End of the line? Watch on BBC iPlayer how the story of HS2 unfolded. Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) The firm's executive chair said HS2's costs had risen so much over the past decade because of poor cost estimating, changes to the project's scope, some poor delivery and the impact of inflation. He added that decisions to delay parts of the project for cashflow reasons, could end up meaning they cost more, and that the Covid pandemic had added £500m to £600m. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 trains will travel more slowly than existing Pendolino trains when they travel on conventional tracks between Birmingham and Manchester, because they cannot tilt on bends. He said he expects fewer seats to be available on HS2 north of Birmingham now the legs to Manchester and Crewe have been scrapped, due to trains having to be shorter to fit existing platforms. HS2 trains of the same length as the current Pendolinos would be used, but would have fewer seats. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 was waiting for the government to make decisions on certain aspects of the project, including the tunnel south from Old Oak Common to Euston. Development of the railway's terminus at London Euston will depend on investment from private developers, with plans to develop housing around the station. The site for a station at Euston has already been cleared, with residents and businesses forced out. Until the new station is built, HS2 will end at Old Oak Common in West London, meaning people would have to change trains to reach the capital's heart. The government has said there has been interest from developers. However, in a BBC interview in November, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, would not say how soon he wanted to have a firm commitment from investors, or a new station design - arguing that an ""artificial deadline"" could damage the government's negotiating hand. Mr Harper also could not say whether the tunnel taking trains from Old Oak Common to Euston would be paid for by private investors or the taxpayer. He told the BBC that this would depend on ""how much private sector money we can get in"", and he wanted to ""get the possible deal for taxpayers"". He maintained that bringing in the private sector would help the scheme be delivered on time and budget. The government claims getting private investors to pay for Euston will save £6.5bn. Mr Harper told the BBC this figure had been reached by converting the £4.8bn cost of the latest 10-platform station design into 2023 prices. But ministers had already said that design was unaffordable. Work on Euston was paused in March 2023, with the time to be used for developing an ""affordable and deliverable station design"". In November, HS2 Ltd confirmed it would continue the process of buying more than 200 homes and businesses along the scrapped Manchester route on advice from the government. The figure includes sales under ""blight"", where owners ask the government to buy their property at the price they would have been worth if an infrastructure project such as road or rail works had not lowered its market value. A spokesperson said at the time that such acquisitions may continue ""where the claimant wishes to proceed and there is a compelling case to do so"", including where applications were submitted before the government announcement. ""We have also identified a limited number of locations and properties where the compulsory purchase process is well advanced and needs to continue until it's completed,"" the spokesperson added. Meanwhile people whose land or properties had already been purchased have been left in limbo, as the government develops a plan for selling back land that's no longer needed. Ministers have said this will not be quick. Mr Harper told the BBC in November land sales would be done in a ""careful, sensible way"" without ""rushing"".","['HS2', 'Rail travel', 'Housing', 'Department for Transport']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DEC8/production/_131323075_3c652462a217c2dc17113924a82c99f6a30cd179.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0253/production/_124659500_generic_banner_top.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2BC/production/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/12D10/production/_131327077_hs2_without_northernpowerhouse_v3_2x640-nc.png']","['By Katy Austin & Tom Espiner', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

Over 30 backbenchers on the right of the party are backing plans to change the bill next week to make it harder for people to appeal deportation. The amendments underline the scale of Tory division over the policy, which the PM has made a priority. Ministers insist the bill allows only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. Those backing the amendments include former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and a clutch of former cabinet ministers, including former home secretary Suella Braverman. Ex-migration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the draft law last month and is a leading rebel, said the current bill would fail to prevent a ""merry-go-round"" of individual appeals. The Rwanda policy dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer arguing the prime minister had been ""taken hostage by his own party"". He added that reports over the weekend that he had doubts about the policy when he was chancellor showed Mr Sunak had been ""caught red handed"". ""He knows the Rwanda gimmick won't work - but he can't be honest about it because he's too scared of his own MPs,"" he added. In reply, the prime minister said the government would deliver on its promise to halt migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. Mr Sunak said Labour had not put forward a ""single practical idea"" to reduce illegal migration, and ""can never be trusted to stop the boats"". The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court. The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds. Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights. The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended. A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful. However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"". He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum. He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly. Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably. Ministers could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament. And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law. The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67932595,Post Office scandal: Hundreds of victims to have convictions overturned,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"".",2024-01-10,"Hundreds wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal could have their names cleared this year, after emergency laws were announced to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"". Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said that hundreds fell victim to a ""brutal and arbitrary exercise of power"". There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal over 16 years. But only 93 of these convictions have since been overturned. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses based on the faulty Horizon IT system. Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates - who inspired the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office - told the BBC it was ""another positive step forward"". However, he said ""the devil is in the detail, and we've yet to see that"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The prime minister's spokesman said the government intends to ""introduce the legislation within weeks"" and is ""confident it will be well-supported"". Speaking in the Commons after the prime minister, Mr Hollinrake said evidence that emerged from the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal suggested the Post Office acted with ""incompetence and malevolence"". He described the decision to overturn the convictions through an Act of Parliament as ""unprecedented"" and said it had not been taken lightly, given its potential ramifications on the legal system. Mr Hollinrake said the move applying to England and Wales ""raises important constitutional issues"" around the independence of the courts, which are normally the authority that would overturn a conviction. The minister also accepted the new law would risk seeing people who were genuinely guilty of a crime pardoned - though the government estimates that to be a very small proportion of the total number affected. Asked by the BBC's PM programme why it had taken a TV drama to inspire action on a problem known about for over a decade, Mr Hollinrake said the show released this year had moved the public as well as people in government. ""We are people ourselves of course. We watch TV ourselves and see this stuff, and we and other people within government realise this is a situation we've got to resolve,"" he said. While the full detail of the law has not been published, Downing Street said it would amount to a blanket overturning of convictions tied to the faulty Horizon IT system. But the Department for Business told the BBC convictions would not be lifted until former sub-postmasters and postmistresses signed a declaration that they had not committed any crime. Mr Hollinrake said by signing the document, they will become eligible for the compensation payment of £600,000 already available to people who have cleared their names via the courts. The declaration is designed to prevent ""guilty people walking away with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money"", he said, adding: ""Anyone falsely signing this will be subject for prosecution for fraud."" The government has also confirmed it will: Mr Hollinrake said it may take ""some weeks"" to publish the fine details of the law, and a lawyer who has represented some former sub-postmasters and postmistresses said he was awaiting the full text before passing judgement. The lawyer who represented the 555 in their first legal action against the Post Office, James Hartley, described the compensation announcement as ""a sensible step forward"". He said it would give those affected the option to decide ""whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation"". The government is keenly aware that by moving to unpick decisions made by independent judges, it risks setting a constitutional convention which risks upsetting the independence of the courts. Lord Ken MacDonald, who was director of Crown Prosecution Service from 2003 to 2008, said the move amounted to ""parliament seizing from the courts and from the judges, the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty"". He continued: ""I think the government is going for a rather grand gesture here and I hope it doesn't come back to bite us."" Wednesday's announcement comes after a fortnight in which a scandal that had played out largely in the wings was thrust centre stage by the ITV drama series. Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, was portrayed in the drama. Mr Castleton said it cost him £321,000 to go through the legal process with the Post Office and his family was ""ostracised"" in their village in Yorkshire. ""People abused us in the street for being thieves and my children were bullied,"" he said. He told the BBC the compensation payment announced by the government was ""much appreciated"" but that he ""would just like to get to the end of this"". Noel Thomas, 77, from Anglesey in Wales, said he was not convinced by Mr Sunak's plan. Mr Thomas was jailed for false accounting in 2006 after his books fell short by £48,000. He said he would have to ""wait to see the small print"", and added he had been ""promised a hell of a lot"" so far only for nothing to come of it. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued prosecutions against people running branches of the business based on losses which were flagged by Horizon, an IT accounting programme designed by Japanese tech firm Fujitsu. Faults with the software meant it wrongly showed some sub-postmasters racking up losses, leading them to be accused of crimes like theft or false accounting - and losing their livelihoods and good names as a result. To date, only 93 people prosecuted by the Post Office over the period have had their convictions overturned in court. Some sub-postmasters caught up in the scandal have died or taken their own lives in the intervening years. Around 700 of the prosecutions were led by the Post Office, with others carried out by other bodies, including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the affair which was launched in 2021 is set to resume on Thursday. The Post Office said it aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"". The government has committed to holding Fujitsu to account if they are found to be culpable by the public inquiry. The firm has been awarded more than £6.5bn in public contracts since 2013, according to procurement analysts Tussell. A spokesperson for Fujitsu said the company recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/34CD/production/_132271531_postoffice-top-getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12315/production/_132271547_mediaitem132271546.jpg']","['By Sean Seddon & George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

While Ed was Minister, the scandal was not raised with Ed on the floor of the House of Commons."" In response to questions about Sir Ed's initial decision not to meet Alan Bates, the leading campaigner for postmasters, the draft email stresses that in October 2010 the pair did then meet, and that Sir Ed ""followed up, writing to him with answers he had been given by Post Office executives. However, the Post Office misled him, providing categorical assurances about Horizon which were untrue."" A Lib Dem spokesperson said: ""This is all open to the general public already and made clear on a page on our website."" Conservative MPs have seized on the controversy to call for Sir Ed to hand back his knighthood or even resign as Lib Dem leader. At Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson called on Sir Ed to ""clear his desk, clear his diary and clear off"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67932247,"HS2 to Birmingham may cost £65bn, railway boss says","The London to Birmingham stretch of the HS2 railway could cost more than £65bn in current prices, the boss of the company building it has said.",2024-01-10,"The London to Birmingham stretch of the HS2 railway could cost more than £65bn in current prices, the boss of the company building it has said. Sir Jonathan Thompson said a rise in the cost of materials such as concrete and steel over the past few years have added £8bn to £10bn. In October the government cancelled the sections between the West Midlands, Manchester, and the East Midlands. Now HS2 Ltd and the government disagree on the cost of building the rest. The company's latest estimate for the London to Birmingham stretch is between £49bn and £56.6bn in 2019 prices. The government thinks it should be delivered at the lower end of £45bn to £54bn. These estimates were put together before October's announcement. However, Sir Jonathan does not believe £45bn is possible. He said the price tag might be lower without the taxpayer funding a new station at Euston, but doubted that would bring down the cost as much as the government stated. He said the budget given for the overall programme had been too low to begin with. ""The cost of delivery is more than the government budgeted, and that is before you begin to account for the extraordinary construction inflation over the last three years or so."" Labour said the new cost projections were a direct result of the prime minister's ""weak leadership and mismanagement of HS2"". ""As chief secretary, chancellor and now PM Rishi Sunak has allowed costs to soar and public money go down the drain. This is a government with no direction, no plan and no regard for taxpayers' money,"" shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said. HS2: End of the line? Watch on BBC iPlayer how the story of HS2 unfolded. Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) The firm's executive chair said HS2's costs had risen so much over the past decade because of poor cost estimating, changes to the project's scope, some poor delivery and the impact of inflation. He added that decisions to delay parts of the project for cashflow reasons, could end up meaning they cost more, and that the Covid pandemic had added £500m to £600m. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 trains will travel more slowly than existing Pendolino trains when they travel on conventional tracks between Birmingham and Manchester, because they cannot tilt on bends. He said he expects fewer seats to be available on HS2 north of Birmingham now the legs to Manchester and Crewe have been scrapped, due to trains having to be shorter to fit existing platforms. HS2 trains of the same length as the current Pendolinos would be used, but would have fewer seats. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 was waiting for the government to make decisions on certain aspects of the project, including the tunnel south from Old Oak Common to Euston. Development of the railway's terminus at London Euston will depend on investment from private developers, with plans to develop housing around the station. The site for a station at Euston has already been cleared, with residents and businesses forced out. Until the new station is built, HS2 will end at Old Oak Common in West London, meaning people would have to change trains to reach the capital's heart. The government has said there has been interest from developers. However, in a BBC interview in November, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, would not say how soon he wanted to have a firm commitment from investors, or a new station design - arguing that an ""artificial deadline"" could damage the government's negotiating hand. Mr Harper also could not say whether the tunnel taking trains from Old Oak Common to Euston would be paid for by private investors or the taxpayer. He told the BBC that this would depend on ""how much private sector money we can get in"", and he wanted to ""get the possible deal for taxpayers"". He maintained that bringing in the private sector would help the scheme be delivered on time and budget. The government claims getting private investors to pay for Euston will save £6.5bn. Mr Harper told the BBC this figure had been reached by converting the £4.8bn cost of the latest 10-platform station design into 2023 prices.

The Lib Dem leader has been under pressure since it emerged he initially refused to meet campaigner Alan Bates when he was a minister. He says he ""deeply regrets not realising that the Post Office was lying to him"". The BBC has seen a draft response to emails about the issue. The document says that ""if asked about Ed's role"", Lib Dem MPs should reply by stressing that ""the scandal took place over many years from 1999, during which time different governments and ministers from all parties were in post"". The script continues: ""For 19 months, between 2010 and early 2012, the now Liberal Democrat Leader, Ed Davey, served as Postal Affairs Minister. While Ed was Minister, the scandal was not raised with Ed on the floor of the House of Commons."" In response to questions about Sir Ed's initial decision not to meet Alan Bates, the leading campaigner for postmasters, the draft email stresses that in October 2010 the pair did then meet, and that Sir Ed ""followed up, writing to him with answers he had been given by Post Office executives. However, the Post Office misled him, providing categorical assurances about Horizon which were untrue."" A Lib Dem spokesperson said: ""This is all open to the general public already and made clear on a page on our website."" Conservative MPs have seized on the controversy to call for Sir Ed to hand back his knighthood or even resign as Lib Dem leader. At Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson called on Sir Ed to ""clear his desk, clear his diary and clear off"". Lib Dem sources say Labour and Conservative ministers were also in positions of power during the long-running scandal.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67932247,"HS2 to Birmingham may cost £65bn, railway boss says","The London to Birmingham stretch of the HS2 railway could cost more than £65bn in current prices, the boss of the company building it has said.",2024-01-10,"The London to Birmingham stretch of the HS2 railway could cost more than £65bn in current prices, the boss of the company building it has said. Sir Jonathan Thompson said a rise in the cost of materials such as concrete and steel over the past few years have added £8bn to £10bn. In October the government cancelled the sections between the West Midlands, Manchester, and the East Midlands. Now HS2 Ltd and the government disagree on the cost of building the rest. The company's latest estimate for the London to Birmingham stretch is between £49bn and £56.6bn in 2019 prices. The government thinks it should be delivered at the lower end of £45bn to £54bn. These estimates were put together before October's announcement. However, Sir Jonathan does not believe £45bn is possible. He said the price tag might be lower without the taxpayer funding a new station at Euston, but doubted that would bring down the cost as much as the government stated. He said the budget given for the overall programme had been too low to begin with. ""The cost of delivery is more than the government budgeted, and that is before you begin to account for the extraordinary construction inflation over the last three years or so."" Labour said the new cost projections were a direct result of the prime minister's ""weak leadership and mismanagement of HS2"". ""As chief secretary, chancellor and now PM Rishi Sunak has allowed costs to soar and public money go down the drain. This is a government with no direction, no plan and no regard for taxpayers' money,"" shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said. HS2: End of the line? Watch on BBC iPlayer how the story of HS2 unfolded. Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) The firm's executive chair said HS2's costs had risen so much over the past decade because of poor cost estimating, changes to the project's scope, some poor delivery and the impact of inflation. He added that decisions to delay parts of the project for cashflow reasons, could end up meaning they cost more, and that the Covid pandemic had added £500m to £600m. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 trains will travel more slowly than existing Pendolino trains when they travel on conventional tracks between Birmingham and Manchester, because they cannot tilt on bends. He said he expects fewer seats to be available on HS2 north of Birmingham now the legs to Manchester and Crewe have been scrapped, due to trains having to be shorter to fit existing platforms. HS2 trains of the same length as the current Pendolinos would be used, but would have fewer seats. Sir Jonathan also said HS2 was waiting for the government to make decisions on certain aspects of the project, including the tunnel south from Old Oak Common to Euston. Development of the railway's terminus at London Euston will depend on investment from private developers, with plans to develop housing around the station. The site for a station at Euston has already been cleared, with residents and businesses forced out. Until the new station is built, HS2 will end at Old Oak Common in West London, meaning people would have to change trains to reach the capital's heart. The government has said there has been interest from developers. However, in a BBC interview in November, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, would not say how soon he wanted to have a firm commitment from investors, or a new station design - arguing that an ""artificial deadline"" could damage the government's negotiating hand. Mr Harper also could not say whether the tunnel taking trains from Old Oak Common to Euston would be paid for by private investors or the taxpayer. He told the BBC that this would depend on ""how much private sector money we can get in"", and he wanted to ""get the possible deal for taxpayers"". He maintained that bringing in the private sector would help the scheme be delivered on time and budget. The government claims getting private investors to pay for Euston will save £6.5bn. Mr Harper told the BBC this figure had been reached by converting the £4.8bn cost of the latest 10-platform station design into 2023 prices. But ministers had already said that design was unaffordable. Work on Euston was paused in March 2023, with the time to be used for developing an ""affordable and deliverable station design"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67940193,Can scheme to quash Post Office convictions work?,The government's plan to clear the names of hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the Post Office Horizon software scandal is truly unprecedented.,2024-01-10,"The government's plan to clear the names of hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the Post Office Horizon software scandal is truly unprecedented. It will be some weeks before the legislation is presented to Parliament, but we have a pretty clear idea of what the headlines translate to - and why, on a much deeper level, it represents a constitutional leap into the dark, albeit for a noble cause. In short, the Bill won't list name-by-name the individuals that the government proposes to clear of wrongdoing. There will be no long schedule of the innocent read out in the Houses of Parliament. Instead, the Bill will be a mechanism that declares that anyone found guilty of a Post Office scandal-related offence, during a specific time frame, will have their conviction quashed as soon as the legislation receives Royal Assent. In other words, exoneration will be a truly automatic process: no declaration in an appeal court, vindicating the innocent. Scotland, which runs a different legal system, is also planning a similar law. A blanket exoneration also means ministers have decided Parliament should, without considering the individual facts, overturn convictions of any one who was genuinely guilty. Faced with a moral dilemma of how to best see speedy justice done for the innocent, the government has made a political choice to live with that consequence. Policy officials and government lawyers have an awful lot to work though in the coming weeks to make the plan a reality. For a start, they have to work out how to make sure that UK criminal records are swiftly expunged and that there is a robust and trusted bureaucratic record of who has been exonerated. Ministers must also decide what to do with the small number of individuals who have so far failed in attempted appeals. It is not clear at present whether the legislation will need to deal with around 50 cases rejected by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the official miscarriages body that refused to send those appeals back to judges. Assuming all those issues can be solved, quashing the convictions then unlocks the door to compensation. The government has a standing offer of £600,000 to anyone who has their conviction quashed in relation to the scandal - but that money won't be paid out automatically once the Bill becomes law. Nobody cleared under the plan will receive that cash until they sign a declaration that they definitely were not guilty. That declaration will basically act as a promise they have not done anything wrong. And that means that anyone who was genuinely guilty could be later prosecuted for attempting to defraud the government by taking advantage of the scheme. This sounds neat in practice because it tries to minimise the risk of repeat fraud. But the question is whether some of those who are genuinely innocent have enough trust in the state to sign the form, given they may fear being wrongfully convicted again. The only realistic alternative to all of this was to find some way to speed up the Court of Appeals process. The former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, told the BBC earlier this week that the courts could handle the workload. There are, for instance, recently retired highly experienced Court of Appeal judges who could help run the cases in large batches. Serving judges don't comment on Parliament and politics - but there is a lot of nervousness in the legal world from which they are drawn. Constitutionally, Parliament and politicians have no business interfering with the decisions of courts - that is how power is separated and balanced in the UK. This plan tips that delicate balance. ""What we have is Parliament seizing from the courts and the judges the right to say who is guilty and who is not guilty,"" Lord Ken MacDonald, the former Director of Public Prosecutions told The BBC. ""And the problem is that once this dam is burst - we can all see it's being done for the best of reasons here - who's to say how such a process might be used in the future?"" Will another government, on another day, be once again tempted to override the independent courts? The government will be under pressure to make sure that this legislation is truly a one-off exceptional step to correct the most exceptional injustice in British legal history.","['Post Office Ltd', 'Post Office Inquiry']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4F03/production/_132272202_gettyimages-93286126.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']",,UK,Politics

Twenty-one local authorities have already implemented the ban, while Powys council has confirmed it will be joining them. It comes as part of the RSPCA's No Fun At The Fair campaign, which is calling for regulation on events which have historically given animals as rewards. But the charity says an outright Welsh government ban is needed to prevent the practice happening on private land. Sioned Nikolic, RSPCA Cymru's public affairs officer, said: ""Only a few months ago we were calling on 10 local authorities to take action and now we have all councils in agreement that this will not be happening on their land."" But the ban does not mean the practice cannot continue on private land. ""We know that this is something people care about, with many assuming it is already banned,"" she said. ""We would ultimately like to see pets being given away as prizes banned outrightly by the Welsh government."" Since 2020, there have been 42 reports about pets being given as prizes made to the RSPCA, but the charity fears many incidents go unreported. Goldfish are the animal most commonly associated with prize-giving, but the RSPCA says they are easily stressed and very often fish that are won as prizes suffer miserably from shock and oxygen starvation or die prematurely from changes in water temperature. Ms Nikolic added: ""They're misunderstood pets as they can make great companions, but can actually be challenging to look after. New owners must do their research before they acquire the fish, not afterwards. ""Before bringing a fish home for the first time, it's important to set the tank up at least two weeks in advance to make sure it's all running smoothly, and this just isn't possible for someone who's won a fish without being prepared for it.""","['Environment', 'RSPCA', 'Wales', 'Fish', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/863C/production/_125746343_gettyimages-131491177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F4/production/_125746350_gettyimages-88374868.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Catriona Aitken', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

Jo Stevens and Thangam Debbonaire said that a ""damaging situation"" was continuing ""unchecked"" by the UK government. In response Ms Frazer said she is taking the matter ""very seriously"". In her first public comments on the matter issued late on Tuesday night, the minister said she expects S4C to address issues identified ""as a matter of urgency"". But Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said interference by the UK government by itself ""will not solve issues at S4C"". The chief executive of S4C, Sian Doyle, was sacked late last year ahead of the publication of allegations in a report that she behaved like a dictator - accusations she denied. Her father later blamed S4C and the UK government for his daughter taking an overdose, saying she had been the subject herself of ""constant"" bullying. Chief content officer Llinos Griffin-Williams was also fired after she allegedly told a rugby star that his Welsh skills were not good enough and that she could end his career. The broadcaster's chairman, Rhodri Williams, has also been accused of acting inappropriately by shouting at Ms Griffin-Williams. He was said to have apologised. Ultimate control over broadcasting in Wales lies in London. S4C is overseen by its board, the chair of which is appointed by the UK government. In a joint letter, shadow Welsh secretary Ms Stevens and shadow culture secretary Ms Debbonaire said S4C ""cannot be allowed to flounder any further"". Writing to Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, the frontbenchers wrote: ""Since its inception in 1982, S4C has been an important representation of Welsh society, its people and language."" They said that ""recent efforts to modernise the channel have been overshadowed by a series of crises that suggest deep-rooted problems with the organisation's leadership, management and culture, which should be of real concern to you as the responsible Cabinet Minister."" The MPs said ""questions remain"" about the process that led to the independent report and the sacking of the two senior officers, and whether the S4C board ""and interim leadership can swiftly deliver the fundamental changes which are clearly needed to transform the organisation and its working environment"". ""However, there has been total silence from you and your department as this unfortunate saga has unfolded. ""We are deeply concerned that this is allowing a damaging situation to continue unchecked."" The letter asked if Ms Frazer would consider ""an investigation or rapid review"", and that she would ""begin to take a more active interest in its situation. It comes ahead of Rhodri Williams' evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. A department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS] spokesperson said: ""Complaints relating to members of staff are a matter for S4C, which is independent of the government. ""Now that the results of the investigation by Capital Law have been published, we expect S4C to address the issues identified as a matter of urgency. ""As its sponsor department, DCMS has maintained regular contact with S4C throughout this investigation, as well as giving the allegations and concerns raised careful and appropriate consideration. We will continue to do so."" In a response, Ms Frazer said: ""We take the recent developments at S4C very seriously."" She said officials have been in regular contact with members of S4C's executive team throughout the work by Capital Law, which produced the report on S4C. ""I am concerned with the findings of the report and allegations that have been raised and, as I have made clear several times, I expect S4C to address the issues identified as a matter of urgency."" ""I have not met the chair of S4C but my officials regularly liaise with him.""

""We've seen a decline in pupil behaviour, especially truancy in classes, and physical and verbal abuse of teachers,"" said teacher Mark Adams, a NASUWT representative. ""My members are at risk, and we've decided enough is enough."" Mr Adams said nothing had come out of eight months of negotiations with school leaders on the issue. ""They don't seem to be taking the matter seriously,"" he said, and that abuse was adding to the strain on staff in a profession that is already becoming increasingly difficult. ""It's affecting the learning of the children, but also the physical and mental health of teachers at the school,"" he added. ""We've got a number of teachers off at present on work-related stress, and we'd rather get them back in the classroom. ""Long term we'll lose teachers, good teachers from this industry.""

NASUWT's national officer in Wales, Neil Butler, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that ""gangs of learners"" have been ""roaming the corridors"" of the school. ""They've got a serious internal truancy problem,"" he said, and that verbal abuse had become a daily occurrence in classrooms. ""We're getting to the point where its almost accepted practice in schools and that's got to stop,"" he said. ""Without respect for teachers there can't be learning in classrooms."" ""It's also bad in other schools as well,"" Mr Butler said. ""We've got disputes in six schools across Wales over this issue. ""We don't think employers are taking our health and safety concerns seriously enough and we will be taking action in any school that doesn't protect its teachers."" While assaults on teachers are ""mercifully reasonably rare"", he said they were happening. ""When physical assaults are committed on teachers we expect a robust response from employers such as permanent exclusion and the situation dealt with seriously and we're not seeing that,"" he said. ""We are striking because of our employer's response,"" said Sharron Daly, NASUWT's representative for south east Wales. ""What's happening here isn't different from any other school in Wales - what's different here is the management's response to that behaviour.""

Mid and East Antrim Borough Council previously expressed concern about the impact on tourism. Northern Ireland has a legally-binding target of generating 80% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2030. A statement said ""due cognisance"" had been given to ""the contribution that renewable energy can make to both the economy and tackling climate change"".

Jennifer McCorry, the firm's senior development project manager, said it was extremely disappointed by the decision. She said that for Northern Ireland the project would help Northern Ireland to meet renewable energy targets and create up to £5m worth of wages in the 12-month construction period. The decision on the notice of opinion to refuse was taken by the department's permanent secretary under powers laid out in the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act 2022. It is legislation that allows officials to make certain decisions in the absence of ministers. The decision may be appealed up to six weeks after being made. It came as the NI Chamber of Commerce published proposals for the reform of the planning system. Its ideas include legal and regulatory changes alongside improving existing processes. It suggests that statutory consultees, which includes public bodies like NI Water, should face strict deadlines, after which it could be assumed they consent to a planning application. Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of NI Chamber, said: ""A well-performing planning function is key to instilling confidence in the market for potential investors and to enable the development of the required infrastructure, when it comes to connectivity, services, energy and reducing our carbon emissions.""","['Wind farms', 'NI economy', 'Wind power', 'Wind turbines', 'Renewable energy']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A858/production/_132269034_gettyimages-535137064.jpg'],"['By Louise Cullen', 'BBC NI agriculture and environment correspondent']",Business,New Tech Economy
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-67925436,Ralph Fiennes adds voice to campaign against 112-mile pylons route,Hollywood actor Ralph Fiennes has made a film campaigning against plans to install electricity hubs and pylons across the area where he grew up.,2024-01-10,"Hollywood actor Ralph Fiennes has made a film campaigning against plans to install electricity hubs and pylons across the area where he grew up. The Suffolk-born star created the four-minute film to back Suffolk Energy Action Solutions' (SEAS) call to build an offshore grid. ""The environmental legacy of any government is at stake,"" he said. However, National Grid has disputed Fiennes' claims that an offshore solution would be cheaper. Fiennes' four-minute film, called Coast, was launched on Tuesday alongside a SEAS nationwide petition to stop the current plans and push for a parliamentary debate. Opening with black-and-white footage of Fiennes as a toddler playing on Covehithe beach, the actor told how his father was a farmer in nearby Wangford. He spoke out against ""creating acres of steel and concrete in areas of profound natural beauty"". Fiennes, known for his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter franchise, said: ""[National Grid's] proposals involve a complex of electrical infrastructure with landfall at Aldeburgh, Walberswick, Southwold towards two vast electrical hubs, built inland destroying many acres of heathland and habitat, coastline and wetland irreversibly."" He also said neighbouring North Sea-sharing countries had harnessed wind power through integrated offshore networks. SEAS founder Fiona Gilmore said the star had offered to help before writing a script and filming with director Charles Sturridge. ""He feels passionately - he is a Suffolk lad and he could have been a farmer [but] he ended up being an actor,"" she said. ""We are incredibly grateful because it's the sort of film that makes me cry. ""We're hoping that hearing Ralph Fiennes talk about those offshore solutions and saying that they are viable, you can do them tomorrow... we think that people might sit up and listen."" Campaigners said they feared construction work on underground cables, a proposed energy hub at Friston and converter station near Saxmundham would not only be a blight to the countryside and residents, but also have a detrimental impact on tourism. They argued a better option was an offshore grid with substations on brownfield sites, such as Bradwell in Essex, and closer to demand. It could also mean proposals for 112-mile long (180km) route of pylons from Norwich in Norfolk via Bramford in Suffolk to Tilbury in Essex could be revised. Fiennes released his film on the same day National Grid met local politicians, MPs and community representatives in Friston. Jake Rigg, from National Grid's Electricity System Operator division, said the authority was conducting an independent study to look at all options and ""put some facts into the debate"". In a statement, National Grid disputed Fiennes' claims that an offshore solution would be cheaper, based on costs it published in 2023, and said an environmental impact assessment would be included in any plans. ""The existing electricity transmission network was built in the 1960s and was not designed to transport the clean, green, renewable energy from where it is generated out at sea, to homes and businesses across the country,"" the statement said. ""The Great Grid Upgrade is the largest overhaul of the grid in generations, and as electricity demand is set to double, it is a critical part of how the UK can lower energy bills, combat climate change, and reach net zero."" The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said householders living near any new infrastructure could receive up to £1,000 off their electricity bills. It said: ""Offshore wind will play a key part in delivering the transition to net zero, but without the development of necessary networks onshore, this ambition cannot be achieved, threatening energy security and increasing costs for hard-working families.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-67836727,Derbyshire farmer fears he will be turfed off land for solar farm,A Derbyshire farmer fears he could lose his livelihood if plans for a solar farm go ahead.,2024-01-10,"A Derbyshire farmer fears he could lose his livelihood if plans for a solar farm go ahead. Andrew Dakin is the third generation of tenant farmers who have worked the land at Kidsley Farm, near Heanor. But plans for a new solar farm could see all his farming land sold off and solar panels put in place instead. Mr Dakin said it would be impossible for him to continue farming if Amber Valley Borough Council granted permission for the solar farm. The solar farm, which would be built on Mr Dakin's land, is one of two applications for neighbouring solar farms north of Derby and Smalley, which would sit 500m apart and cover an area of 328 acres. Mr Dakin said the farm on his land, which would span 180 acres, would take away all the fields he uses to rear cattle for beef and leave only the house he lives in. He told the BBC he would be enormously sad if he was forced to stop farming. He said: ""It's a way of life. It means absolutely everything and it would be devastating to see it go for a solar farm. ""It's all I've ever done - I've never been on holiday since I was 15 because I love being on the farm and I don't want to be anywhere else."" A spokesman for the solar farm developer, Intelligent Alternatives, said issues relating to land ownership and tenancy were private commercial matters. He said building on greenbelt land was allowed in special circumstances, such as tackling climate change, and pledged the land would be reinstated for agriculture afterwards. The spokesman added the full planning applications would not be submitted until after January and the community and councils would be kept informed. Amy Wheelton, who is a tenant farmer and local councillor who also sits on South Derbyshire District Council's planning committee, said she was alarmed at the number of applications being made for solar farms on agricultural land. ""Solar can be good,"" she said. ""I've no argument with somebody wanting to put it on their chicken sheds or their business. ""But you can have farmers that have been three generations farming, as I have on my tenanted land - some have invested millions in their businesses - and like that it's gone. ""There's no security of tenure and it's just wrong."" Ms Wheelton has solar panels covering her office rooftops and said it was ""crackers"" to use agricultural land for solar farms, as there was enough south-facing roof space in the UK to produce half the country's energy needs. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said the issue of tenant farmers being turfed off their land for solar farms was a ""huge and growing issue"" and called for a national database of solar schemes to illustrate the scale of the issue. He said: ""People are losing their businesses here for a pittance in terms of compensation. ""We're worried that food security is being damaged by the amount of land we're potentially going to see lost to solar schemes. ""We would much prefer this being put on to roofs of buildings and farm buildings and having microgeneration rather than these huge schemes taking the best and most versatile agricultural land out of production."" However, Sam Richards of Britain Remade, said moving quickly to renewable energy ""simply has to happen"". He said: ""If we truly believe that we have a climate emergency, if we really want to cut our energy bills, then fundamentally we're going to need to build.""

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later deleted the post and said its account had been ""compromised"". The social media platform has said the compromised account was not due to a breach of its systems. US regulators are expected to make an announcement on the new ETFs this week. The false post appeared on the SEC's official X account shortly after 16:00 Washington time (21:00 GMT). It said the regulator ""grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges"". The post was immediately picked up and quoted by social media users and business news outlets. Within minutes the SEC's chair Gary Gensler posted a message refuting the erroneous announcement on his personal X account: ""The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products."" ""The SEC has determined that there was unauthorized access to and activity on the @SECGov x.com account by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET,"" an SEC spokesperson told the BBC. ""That unauthorized access has been terminated,"" they added. ""The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct."" Later on Tuesday, X said it had completed a preliminary probe into the false post on the SEC's account and found that it was not due to a breach of the social media platform's systems. ""We can confirm that the account @SECGov was compromised and we have completed a preliminary investigation,"" X said. ""Based on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X's systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party,"" it added. ""We can also confirm that the account did not have two-factor authentication enabled at the time the account was compromised."" Bitcoin jumped to almost $48,000 (£37,800) immediately after the erroneous post before falling back to around $46,000. Investors are hotly anticipating an SEC announcement on the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which is expected this week. It would mark a key milestone for the cryptocurrency market in gaining acceptance to mainstream financial markets. Several asset management firms have applied for SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs. ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time.

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67922303,Gaming voice actors blindsided by 'garbage' union AI deal,Prominent voice actors say they weren't told about a landmark deal setting out how voices generated by artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in games.,2024-01-10,"Prominent voice actors say they weren't told about a landmark deal setting out how voices generated by artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in games. It has been struck by US actors' union Sag-Aftra and AI firm Replica Studios. The union says it guarantees ""fully informed consent and fair compensation"" for its members. But many voice artists, who have long been concerned AI will replace them, have reacted with fury with one calling the deal ""garbage."" It comes after Sag-Aftra led a months-long strike in 2023 to fight for protections from film and television studios using AI. Many voice actors have suggested this new deal is at odds with the purpose of that industrial action, with Fallout and Mortal Kombat voice actor Sunil Malhotra saying he ""sacrificed to strike half of last year to keep my profession alive, not shop around my AI replica"". In a blog covering the announcement, Sag-Aftra said the deal was ""approved by affected members of the union's voiceover performer community"". ""Recent developments in AI technology have underscored the importance of protecting the rights of voice talent, particularly as game studios explore more efficient ways to create their games,"" said the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. ""With this agreement, we have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances."" But Steve Blum, a voice actor once credited by Guinness for being the most prolific in video games, said ""nobody"" he knew of had approved the deal. According to Sag-Aftra, the agreement lays out terms and conditions for AI-generated voices in video games, which can be licensed by Replica Studios both in gaming and other forms of media. It requires the AI firm to get consent from actors before it uses voices based on their likeness, and also gives voice actors the ability to deny their voice being used in perpetuity without their consent. But it has been met with consternation from the performers themselves, with World of Warcraft voice actor Andrew Russell calling it ""garbage"", while Shelby Young, who will provide the voice of Yuko in the upcoming Persona 3: Reload, said she was ""really disappointed"" in the union. Voice actors outside of gaming have also criticised the agreement, with Joshua Seth, known for voicing Tai in animated series Digimon, calling it a ""big mistake"", while audiobook narrator Paige Reisenfeld said she was ""ashamed"" that her union payments went towards it. And Veronica Taylor, who provided the voice for Ash in Pokemon, asked how the deal was made without being put to a vote. But Sag-Aftra president Fran Dresch said the deal was ""a great example of AI being done right"". Meanwhile, Replica Studios CEO Shreya Nivas said the deal was an ""ethical approach"" to AI. ""We are excited by the new opportunities this opens up for world-leading AAA studios who can now access the benefits of Replica's AI voice technology while knowing that talent is recognized and compensated fairly for the use of their likeness,"" he said.","['Artificial intelligence', 'Gaming']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1CD9/production/_132258370_mediaitem132258369.jpg'],"['By Tom Gerken', 'Technology reporter']",Tech,Tech
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67916142,Bitcoin: Crypto fans can now invest in exchange-traded funds - but what are they?,The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds.,2024-01-10,"The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds. It has approved what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which can be purchased by anyone from pension funds to ordinary investors. The announcement from the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission was accompanied by a stern warning about risks associated with the asset. But cryptocurrency fans reacted with glee - and memes about becoming rich. The US financial watchdog had repeatedly rebuffed earlier requests for approvals, citing concerns about potential for fraud and manipulation. But a US court said last year its justification was inadequate. The go-ahead comes after a false start on Tuesday, when the regulator had to rapidly withdraw an ""unauthorised"" post announcing the decision early. SEC chairman Gary Gensler said on Monday that investors should not mistake the new approvals for an endorsement of the currency. ""Bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,"" he said. ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."" But what is an ETF? ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. An ETF could comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mixture of shares in both top technology and insurance companies. Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day. Why is there such excitement? About a dozen investment companies, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have been waiting for months for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give them the green light to start buying Bitcoin for their own ETFs. And after weeks of wrangling over wording, the first have now been given the nod. This means a new group of investors can now enter the speculative world of Bitcoin, without having to worry about getting digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Billions of dollars are expected to pour into the Bitcoin market, as these financial companies start buying the digital coin. A minority of analysts say the cryptocurrency's price will be little affected, as spot Bitcoin ETFs are already established in other countries. But with the US giants entering the market, most people are expecting the value of bitcoins to rise with demand. The price is notoriously volatile, however. It rose to nearly $70,000 (£55,000) a coin in 2021, before falling to $16,000 in 2022 as scandals shook the industry. But in 2023, it rose steadily, partly due to the hype around the Bitcoin ETF approval, and is now at $44,000. Based on an idea published online in 2008, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most valuable and famous. Its price is often seen as a barometer for the whole industry of thousands of other coins, tokens and products built on the same blockchain technology. And with an influx of new money into the ecosystem, many expect a surge in interest in cryptocurrency technology in general. How will the decision affect cryptocurrency adoption? Some say this landmark decision shows the establishment is finally taking Bitcoin seriously, at least as a speculative asset. For those who consider Bitcoin legitimate ""digital gold"", what better proof could there be than the biggest wealth-management institutions flocking to buy, overseen by regulators? Others say cryptocurrency is about rejecting traditional financial systems in favour of a decentralised, people-powered alternative. And investment bankers buying Bitcoin just to get rich on US dollars is not what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. But judging from the excitement on social media, the prevailing sentiment is hope the cash injection will make existing Bitcoin investors rich. What are the risks to future investors? The price of Bitcoin can change rapidly and often without warning or explanation. So investors will have to weigh that up when they opt for ETFs linked to the digital coin. But ETFs are often sold as high-risk, high-reward products anyway. Another potential risk is cyber-crime. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to huge and costly attacks that have seen crypto companies drained of sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars overnight. And if the likes of Blackrock become major holders of Bitcoin, their cyber-security will be tested in ways to which they are unaccustomed. Another downside is the cost to the environment. Bitcoin relies on a huge number of powerful computers around the world, to process transactions and create coins. Renewable energy use is growing - but it remains to be seen how investment companies can square the potential environmental cost of Bitcoin with buyers worried about environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) compliance.","['Cryptocurrency', 'Investment management', 'Bitcoin']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11EAB/production/_131278337_gettyimages-1436167319.jpg'],"['By Joe Tidy', 'Cyber correspondent']",Tech,Tech
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67860456,All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.",2024-01-10,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique. In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant. It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180: £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more. But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam. Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman. So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others. But finding the victims has proved more tricky. ""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained. The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers. ""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me. The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate. They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived. ""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me. Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"". The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me. I ask him if he still trusts the scammers. ""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call. ""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

In an email to employees, Mr Clancy said he was taking the ""painful step to reduce our headcount"" to ""build a more sustainable business"". He added that the company paid out $1bn to streamers in 2023, but had ""conservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future."" Amazon made $9.9bn profit in July to September, according to its most recent earnings report. That was up from $2.9bn in the same period in 2022. In an email sent to staff at Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, senior vice president of the department Mike Hopkins wrote: ""We've identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investments and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact."" Mr Hopkins added that it was a ""difficult decision to make"". The email indicated that job losses affect staff in the US and around the world. Amazon bought the hundred-year-old MGM Studios for $8.45bn in 2021. In December, it announced it would start putting adverts on Prime Video from 5 February 2024. The reductions at Amazon are the latest in a long series of job cuts in the tech sector, which had expanded rapidly as people increasingly turned to digital services during the pandemic, before contracting as that enthusiasm waned. According to US career consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the tech sector cut 168,032 jobs in 2023 - up 73% compared to 2022.","['Streaming', 'Amazon', 'Twitch', 'Gaming']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/397D/production/_132271741_af47a2b27e46752dcfd23906531e980f6ff7748e.jpg'],,Tech,Tech
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67916142,Bitcoin: Crypto fans can now invest in exchange-traded funds - but what are they?,The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds.,2024-01-10,"The US has made the long-awaited decision to allow Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investing funds. It has approved what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which can be purchased by anyone from pension funds to ordinary investors. The announcement from the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission was accompanied by a stern warning about risks associated with the asset. But cryptocurrency fans reacted with glee - and memes about becoming rich. The US financial watchdog had repeatedly rebuffed earlier requests for approvals, citing concerns about potential for fraud and manipulation. But a US court said last year its justification was inadequate. The go-ahead comes after a false start on Tuesday, when the regulator had to rapidly withdraw an ""unauthorised"" post announcing the decision early. SEC chairman Gary Gensler said on Monday that investors should not mistake the new approvals for an endorsement of the currency. ""Bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,"" he said. ""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."" But what is an ETF? ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. An ETF could comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mixture of shares in both top technology and insurance companies. Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day. Why is there such excitement? About a dozen investment companies, including Blackrock and Fidelity, have been waiting for months for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give them the green light to start buying Bitcoin for their own ETFs. And after weeks of wrangling over wording, the first have now been given the nod. This means a new group of investors can now enter the speculative world of Bitcoin, without having to worry about getting digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Billions of dollars are expected to pour into the Bitcoin market, as these financial companies start buying the digital coin. A minority of analysts say the cryptocurrency's price will be little affected, as spot Bitcoin ETFs are already established in other countries. But with the US giants entering the market, most people are expecting the value of bitcoins to rise with demand. The price is notoriously volatile, however. It rose to nearly $70,000 (£55,000) a coin in 2021, before falling to $16,000 in 2022 as scandals shook the industry. But in 2023, it rose steadily, partly due to the hype around the Bitcoin ETF approval, and is now at $44,000. Based on an idea published online in 2008, by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most valuable and famous. Its price is often seen as a barometer for the whole industry of thousands of other coins, tokens and products built on the same blockchain technology. And with an influx of new money into the ecosystem, many expect a surge in interest in cryptocurrency technology in general. How will the decision affect cryptocurrency adoption? Some say this landmark decision shows the establishment is finally taking Bitcoin seriously, at least as a speculative asset. For those who consider Bitcoin legitimate ""digital gold"", what better proof could there be than the biggest wealth-management institutions flocking to buy, overseen by regulators? Others say cryptocurrency is about rejecting traditional financial systems in favour of a decentralised, people-powered alternative. And investment bankers buying Bitcoin just to get rich on US dollars is not what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. But judging from the excitement on social media, the prevailing sentiment is hope the cash injection will make existing Bitcoin investors rich. What are the risks to future investors? The price of Bitcoin can change rapidly and often without warning or explanation. So investors will have to weigh that up when they opt for ETFs linked to the digital coin. But ETFs are often sold as high-risk, high-reward products anyway. Another potential risk is cyber-crime. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to huge and costly attacks that have seen crypto companies drained of sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars overnight. And if the likes of Blackrock become major holders of Bitcoin, their cyber-security will be tested in ways to which they are unaccustomed. Another downside is the cost to the environment. Bitcoin relies on a huge number of powerful computers around the world, to process transactions and create coins. Renewable energy use is growing - but it remains to be seen how investment companies can square the potential environmental cost of Bitcoin with buyers worried about environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) compliance.","['Cryptocurrency', 'Investment management', 'Bitcoin']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11EAB/production/_131278337_gettyimages-1436167319.jpg'],"['By Joe Tidy', 'Cyber correspondent']",Tech,Tech

It has been struck by US actors' union Sag-Aftra and AI firm Replica Studios. The union says it guarantees ""fully informed consent and fair compensation"" for its members. But many voice artists, who have long been concerned AI will replace them, have reacted with fury with one calling the deal ""garbage."" It comes after Sag-Aftra led a months-long strike in 2023 to fight for protections from film and television studios using AI. Many voice actors have suggested this new deal is at odds with the purpose of that industrial action, with Fallout and Mortal Kombat voice actor Sunil Malhotra saying he ""sacrificed to strike half of last year to keep my profession alive, not shop around my AI replica"". In a blog covering the announcement, Sag-Aftra said the deal was ""approved by affected members of the union's voiceover performer community"". ""Recent developments in AI technology have underscored the importance of protecting the rights of voice talent, particularly as game studios explore more efficient ways to create their games,"" said the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. ""With this agreement, we have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances."" But Steve Blum, a voice actor once credited by Guinness for being the most prolific in video games, said ""nobody"" he knew of had approved the deal. According to Sag-Aftra, the agreement lays out terms and conditions for AI-generated voices in video games, which can be licensed by Replica Studios both in gaming and other forms of media. It requires the AI firm to get consent from actors before it uses voices based on their likeness, and also gives voice actors the ability to deny their voice being used in perpetuity without their consent. But it has been met with consternation from the performers themselves, with World of Warcraft voice actor Andrew Russell calling it ""garbage"", while Shelby Young, who will provide the voice of Yuko in the upcoming Persona 3: Reload, said she was ""really disappointed"" in the union. Voice actors outside of gaming have also criticised the agreement, with Joshua Seth, known for voicing Tai in animated series Digimon, calling it a ""big mistake"", while audiobook narrator Paige Reisenfeld said she was ""ashamed"" that her union payments went towards it. And Veronica Taylor, who provided the voice for Ash in Pokemon, asked how the deal was made without being put to a vote. But Sag-Aftra president Fran Dresch said the deal was ""a great example of AI being done right"". Meanwhile, Replica Studios CEO Shreya Nivas said the deal was an ""ethical approach"" to AI. ""We are excited by the new opportunities this opens up for world-leading AAA studios who can now access the benefits of Replica's AI voice technology while knowing that talent is recognized and compensated fairly for the use of their likeness,"" he said.","['Artificial intelligence', 'Gaming']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1CD9/production/_132258370_mediaitem132258369.jpg'],"['By Tom Gerken', 'Technology reporter']",Tech,Tech

It urged people interested to message the account for more details as well as showing times and dates. Joan Smithson, 62, said the post was convincing due to its ""good spelling"" and the fact it even had a sentence warning people of scams.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67860456,All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.",2024-01-10,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique. In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant. It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180: £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more. But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam. Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman. So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others. But finding the victims has proved more tricky. ""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained. The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers. ""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me. The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate. They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived. ""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me. Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"". The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me. I ask him if he still trusts the scammers. ""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call. ""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

The social media platform has said the compromised account was not due to a breach of its systems. US regulators are expected to make an announcement on the new ETFs this week. The false post appeared on the SEC's official X account shortly after 16:00 Washington time (21:00 GMT). It said the regulator ""grants approval for #Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities exchanges"". The post was immediately picked up and quoted by social media users and business news outlets. Within minutes the SEC's chair Gary Gensler posted a message refuting the erroneous announcement on his personal X account: ""The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products."" ""The SEC has determined that there was unauthorized access to and activity on the @SECGov x.com account by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4 pm ET,"" an SEC spokesperson told the BBC. ""That unauthorized access has been terminated,"" they added. ""The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct."" Later on Tuesday, X said it had completed a preliminary probe into the false post on the SEC's account and found that it was not due to a breach of the social media platform's systems. ""We can confirm that the account @SECGov was compromised and we have completed a preliminary investigation,"" X said. ""Based on our investigation, the compromise was not due to any breach of X's systems, but rather due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party,"" it added. ""We can also confirm that the account did not have two-factor authentication enabled at the time the account was compromised."" Bitcoin jumped to almost $48,000 (£37,800) immediately after the erroneous post before falling back to around $46,000. Investors are hotly anticipating an SEC announcement on the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, which is expected this week. It would mark a key milestone for the cryptocurrency market in gaining acceptance to mainstream financial markets. Several asset management firms have applied for SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs. ETFs are portfolios that allow investors to bet on multiple assets, without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. Some ETFs already contain Bitcoin indirectly - but a spot Bitcoin ETF will buy the cryptocurrency directly, ""on the spot"", at its current price, throughout the day.","['Cryptocurrency', 'Twitter', 'Bitcoin', 'US Securities and Exchange Commisson']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/06D2/production/_132264710_gettyimages-887657558.jpg'],"['By Peter Hoskins', 'Business reporter']",Tech,Tech
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67925490,Teenagers accused in half of child abuse cases,"Young people taking nude pictures are contributing to a rise in sexual offences committed by children in England and Wales, police figures show.",2024-01-10,"Young people taking nude pictures are contributing to a rise in sexual offences committed by children in England and Wales, police figures show. Potential offenders were aged under 18 in more than half of all reported child abuse cases, according to analysis. Senior officers say this abuse includes ""exploratory behaviour"" under-18s may not realise is illegal, and rape. Police blame the rise on a combination of mobile phone ownership and the availability of hardcore pornography. Ian Critchley, who leads the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) in tackling child abuse, said the new figures demonstrated the need for parents to have ""uncomfortable conversations"" with their children about the problem. The study is the first of its kind carried out by the police Vulnerability Knowledge and Practice Programme, which has been analysing child abuse in England and Wales to help senior officers understand the threat to children. According to the National Police Chiefs Council report, which looked at data from all 42 police forces in England and Wales: The greatest risk to children remains abuse within the family. Police say this now accounts for around a third of child sexual abuse and exploitation, but can often be more severe. Abuse by paedophile gangs, either on or offline, accounted for 5% of offences. But police say they are dealing with a ""growing and concerning trend"" in the number of offences committed by children themselves. The most serious include rape and sexual assault. A third category of offences involves indecent images of children, taken by children. Sometimes the subject has agreed, sometimes they have been coerced. ""It's a crime to take, make, share or distribute an indecent image of a child that is under 18,"" Ian Critchley said,""whether that's in a consensual relationship or not."" ""It's really important that young people understand that."" ""While they may be in a consensual relationship at that time, once that image is shared or unloaded onto a platform it's lost."" Images can be shared widely and used to blackmail the subject. ""That has huge consequences for the health and wellbeing of that individual."" However dealing with offences by children requires police to make difficult decisions. ""The public wouldn't expect us to criminalise young people which would have an impact on the rest of their lives, but it's important we understand the totality of this to make sure the police response is right,"" Mr Critchley said. The NPCC believes young men are now growing up ""three clicks away"" from watching violent, abusive or even illegal videos on pornography platforms. This, officers say, is encouraging them to adopt similar behaviour in sexual situations, or to demand videos and pictures from girls. Senior police officers want the government, which is carrying out a review, to more tightly control access to pornography. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of anti-abuse charity the Internet Watch Foundation said these were crimes that could ""happen in any family, to any child"". ""Having an internet connection and a webcam without supervision is like leaving a door open for the world's worst predators to approach, speak to, groom and ensnare your children,"" she said.","['Online abuse', 'Child abuse', 'Social media']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/32F6/production/_132264031_boyusingmobile.jpg'],"['By Tom Symonds', 'Home Affairs correspondent']",Tech,Tech

Adur and Worthing Council said the waste was expected to remain in its coastal waters until 11:00 GMT on Thursday.“The council is urging visitors to the area’s coastline not to go into the water at this time and to take care on the beach in case waste has been washed ashore,” a spokesman said. Emma Evans, cabinet member for environment and leisure, said the leak was “deeply concerning” and put “residents, visitors and animals at risk”.“We are demanding answers from Southern Water and assurances that this will not happen again,” she said. According to the council, an electrical issue caused two pumps to fail at SW's Shoreham wastewater treatment works, meaning it was unable to release treated waste through its long sea outfall pipe.Instead, it released screened wastewater through its short sea outfall pipe, which is located about 500m offshore in the Shoreham Harbour area, the council added. In a statement, SW said: ""Our teams worked hard through the night to install a temporary pump, which is releasing flows further out to sea via our long sea outfall. We also we have four tankers transferring flows to a nearby treatment works.""We are carrying out investigations on environmental impact. ""We are very sorry that this is happening and are doing everything we can to fix the issue and minimise impact.""Councillor Vicki Wells said she expected such infrastructure to be ""robust"".“Our communities and environment shouldn’t suffer as a consequence of failing equipment,"" she said.“It’s unacceptable for the area’s coastline to be polluted by releases of sewage because pumps have failed.”The Environment Agency has been informed about the leak.

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67410372,The last of the Moon men: the stories of the surviving Apollo astronauts,They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.,2024-01-10,"They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Now, more than 50 years on, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is set to heat up once again. A number of private companies are scheduled to send scientific craft to the Moon in 2024 - although the first of these, Peregrine, ran into trouble shortly after launch. And Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17, later this year but that date has slipped into 2025, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Nasa hopes the new programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. The programme's Ken Mattingly and Frank Borman died within a few days of each other late last year. Now only eight people who have voyaged beyond Earth orbit remain. Who are they, and what are their stories? On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement: many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars. ""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time. In December 1968, Bill Anders flew on Apollo 8, the first mission in which humans travelled beyond low Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for the fourth pass across its face, the crew witnessed an ""Earthrise"" for the first time in human history, Anders capturing the moment on film. The image is widely credited with motivating the global environmental movement and leading to the creation of Earth Day, an annual event to promote activism and awareness of caring for the planet. Speaking of the moment, Anders said: ""We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth."" Following his retirement from the space programme in 1969, Anders largely worked in the aerospace industry for several decades. He also served as US Ambassador to Norway for a year in the 1970s. There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC. In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Lovell, Borman and Anders made history when they undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. Jim Lovell is one of only three men to have travelled to the Moon twice, and following Frank Borman's death in November 2023, he became the oldest living astronaut. Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott, the commander of the Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon. As commander of Apollo 10 in May 1969, Tom Stafford led the final test mission for the programme before the planned landing of Apollo 11. On that mission, Stafford and pilot Eugene Cernan became the first crew to fly the lunar landing module outside Earth orbit. Shortly after his return, Stafford was appointed chief of the Astronaut Office, a role he held for almost two years. In 1975 he was Nasa's commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, the first joint space mission between the US and then-Soviet Union, and a precursor to the International Space Station. His Soviet counterpart, Alexey Leonov, became a lifelong friend. Together they had participated in the momentous handshake in orbit, something that would have been unimaginable at the height of the space race.

Preparatory works have been taking place on a greenfield site on the outskirts of Marske. A councillor claimed evidence of a Roman villa and outbuildings had been unearthed. However, the developers, while confirming some ""Romano-British remains""had been discovered, said no villas or outbuildings had been found. The controversial 812-home development first received outline planning permission in 2017, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Permission was given for a convenience store, primary school, nursery, GP surgery and pharmacy, community hall, petrol filling station, drive-thru restaurant, pub and hotel. Local councillor Dr Tristan Learoyd claimed evidence of a Roman villa and outbuildings had been discovered along a right of way known locally as Plummers Lane. He said he understood the archaeological finds had occurred earlier last year, but he had only found out last week after visiting the site and speaking directly to contractors working on behalf of a local archaeological services company. Mr Learoyd believes there could be more to unearth and has written to the secretary of state to ""demand a halt to the development until the full site has been excavated"". A spokeswoman for the developers Taylor Wimpey and Miller Homes said the pre-start work on the site had revealed some Romano-British remains, ""including ditched enclosures, pottery and worked flints"". However, she said no Roman villas or outbuildings have been found to date. A Historic England spokesman said: ""We are aware that there has been an archaeological discovery at a housing development site in Marske-by-the-Sea and we are providing technical advice to the developer's archaeological contractor.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67917294,Scientists crack mystery of how MS gene spread,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts?",2024-01-10,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts? An international team of scientists say they have unearthed the answer in the DNA of ancient teeth and bones. The genes which protected our ancestors from animal diseases now raise the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The researchers call their discovery ""a quantum leap"" in understanding the evolution of the disease. And they say it could change opinions on what causes MS, and have an impact on the way it is treated. There are about twice as many cases of multiple sclerosis per 100,000 people in north-western Europe, including the UK and Scandinavia, compared with southern Europe. Researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Copenhagen and Oxford spent more than 10 years delving into archaeology to investigate why. MS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms like muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking. They discovered that genes which increase the risk of MS entered into north-western Europe about 5,000 years ago via a massive migration of cattle herders called Yamnaya. The Yamnaya came from western Russia, Ukraine and Kazhakstan, and moved west into Europe, says one of four Nature journal papers published on the topic. The findings ""astounded us all"", said Dr William Barrie, paper author and expert in computational analysis of ancient DNA at University of Cambridge. At the time, the gene variants carried by the herding people were an advantage, helping to protect them against diseases in their sheep and cattle. Nowadays, however, with modern lifestyles, diets and better hygiene, these gene variants have taken on a different role. In the present day, these same traits mean a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as MS. The research project was a huge undertaking - genetic information was extracted from ancient human remains found in Europe and Western Asia, and compared with the genes of hundreds of thousands of people living in the UK today. In the process, a bank of DNA from 5,000 ancient humans, kept in museum collections across many countries, has now been set up to help future research. Prof Lars Fugger, paper author and MS doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, says the discovery helps ""demystify"" the disease. ""MS is not caused by mutations - it's driven by normal genes to protect us against pathogens,"" he explains. Vaccinations, antibiotics and higher standards of hygiene have changed the disease landscape completely - many diseases have disappeared and people are living decades longer. The researchers say modern immune systems may now be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like MS, where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it. Drugs currently used to treat MS target the body's immune system, but the downside is the risk of suppressing it so much that patients struggle to fight off infections. When treating it, we are up against evolutionary forces, Prof Fugger says. ""We need to find the sweet spot where there is a balance with the immune system, rather than wiping it out."" The team now plans to look for other diseases in ancient DNA and follow them back in time. Their research could reveal more about the origins of autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression. Another Nature paper uncovered even more clues about our genetic past - that the Yamnaya herders could also be responsible for north-western Europeans being taller than southern Europeans. And while northern Europeans carry more genetic risk for MS, southern Europeans are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, and eastern Europeans more likely to have Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. DNA from pre-historic hunter-gatherer people raises the risk of Alzheimer's, but ancient farmers' genes are linked to mood disorders, the research explains. It also discovered that humans' ability to digest milk and other dairy products and survive on a vegetable-heavy diet only emerged about 6,000 years ago. Before that, they were meat-eaters. The research compared DNA from thousands of ancient skeletons found in Eurasia to genetic samples from current-day Europeans.","['Archaeology', 'Genetics', 'DNA', 'Health', 'Europe', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1182E/production/_132262717_illustration_3_creditsayostudio.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12651/production/_132254357_gettyimages-1205541058.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A2FE/production/_132262714_ms_gene_migration_map_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C4C8/production/_132267305_976_skull.jpg']","['By Philippa Roxby', 'Health reporter']",Science,Science
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64192508,"What are El Niño and La Niña, and how do they change the weather?","It has been confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year on record, driven by human-caused warming but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Niño.",2024-01-10,"It has been confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year on record, driven by human-caused warming but also boosted by a natural weather system called El Niño. The effects of El Niño could also see record temperatures in 2024. El Niño is part of the natural climate phenomenon called the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It has two opposite states - El Niño and La Niña - both of which significantly alter global weather. An El Niño event is typically declared when sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise to at least 0.5C above the long-term average. In normal conditions, surface water in the Pacific Ocean is cooler in the east and warmer in the west. The ""trade winds"" tend to blow east-to-west, and heat from the Sun progressively warms the waters as they move in this direction. During El Niño events, these winds weaken or reverse, sending warm surface waters eastwards instead. In La Niña periods, the normal east-to-west winds become stronger, pushing warmer waters further west. This causes cold water to rise up - or ""upwell"" - from the depths of the ocean, meaning sea surface temperatures are cooler than usual in the east Pacific. The phenomenon was first observed by Peruvian fisherman in the 1600s, who noticed that warm waters seemed to peak near the Americas in December. They nicknamed the event ""El Niño de Navidad"" - Christ Child in Spanish. Not every ENSO event is the same, and the consequences vary from region to region. However, scientists have observed some common effects: Temperatures Global temperatures typically increase during an El Niño episode, and fall during La Niña. El Niño means warmer water spreads further, and stays closer to the surface. This releases more heat into the atmosphere, creating wetter and warmer air. But the regional effects are complicated, and some places may be both warmer and cooler than expected at different points in the year. The hottest year on record, 2023, was boosted by El Niño conditions, on top of long-term human-caused warming. Between 2020 and 2022, the world experienced an unusually long period of La Niña conditions, which helped keep a lid on global temperatures. How UK and Western European temperatures respond to El Niño is complicated and uncertain. It could mean colder than average winters, for example, but that depends on how El Niño unfolds. Changes to rainfall During El Niño events, the warmer water pushes the Pacific jet stream's strong air currents further to the south and the east. This brings wetter weather to southern USA and the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical regions like southeast Asia, Australia and central Africa typically experience drier conditions. Under La Niña, the effect is reversed. Tropical storms El Niño also affects atmospheric circulation patterns, which means there are generally more tropical storms in the tropical Pacific, but fewer in the tropical Atlantic, including the southern US. During La Niña, the reverse is typically true. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels Scientists have also observed that CO2 levels in the atmosphere increase during El Niño events, possibly as a result of warmer and drier conditions in tropical regions. If plants grow less quickly due to drought, they absorb less CO2, while more wildfires in places like South Asia mean more CO2 is released. The extreme weather events worsened by El Niño and La Niña affect infrastructure, food and energy systems around the world. For example, when less cold water comes to the surface off the west coast of South America during El Niño events, fewer nutrients rise from the bottom of the ocean. That means there is less food available for marine species like squid and salmon, in turn reducing stocks for South American fishing communities. The droughts and flooding caused by the extreme 2015-16 El Niño event affected the food security of more than 60 million people, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation. A recent study suggested that El Niño events significantly reduce global economic growth, an effect which could intensify in the future. El Niño and La Niña episodes typically occur every two to seven years, and usually last nine to 12 months. They don't necessarily alternate: La Niña events are less common than El Niño episodes. In 2021, the UN's climate scientists, the IPCC, said the ENSO events which have occurred since 1950 are stronger than those observed between 1850 and 1950. But it also said that tree rings and other historical evidence show there have been variations in the frequency and strength of these episodes since the 1400s.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67928490,Buy Nothing New- can the campaign work?,"Buy Nothing New Month - it sounds straightforward, doesn't it?",2024-01-10,"Buy Nothing New Month - it sounds straightforward, doesn't it? The campaign asks for you to think about your choices as a consumer - do you actually need to buy new, or can you reuse, repair or repurpose something you already own? It began in Great Britain in January 2023 and a quick internet search doesn't reveal any backlash there. But when it launched for the first time here in January 2024, retailers got angry. A social post promoting the scheme in the Ards and North Down Borough Council area recently caught the ire of local business owners who felt it didn't help their prospects in what is traditionally a tough month. That's perhaps not that surprising, given they've battled with the cost-of-living crisis - which is also a cost-of-doing-business crisis - for more than a year and endured a December disrupted by transport strikes. But changing consumer choices is part of the road to addressing our carbon emissions and waste. Northern Ireland generated almost 230,000 tonnes of household waste in the first three months of 2023. That total includes items for recycling and for landfill, and is equivalent to more than 14,000 double decker buses. If we reduce what we use, less demand will be created for the materials that go into those products, fewer things are likely to contribute to landfill or recycling and less stress will be placed on the planet. But that's where the phrase ""just transition"" comes in - it refers to the need for nobody to be disadvantaged or left behind in the move towards greener, more planet-friendly living. If we suddenly and sharply change our consumption of products, that could jeopardise jobs, threaten the economy and make it harder to sustain a transition to lower-emission lifestyles. But we are already off-track on our net zero aims - so if we don't change our habits, we jeopardise the planet we live on. It's a delicate balancing act - and one with different views, on all sides. BBC News NI spoke to three people - a campaigner, the head of a retail organisation and an upcycler - about their views on how to strike the right balance. Chris Gourley, the waste and pollution solutions strategic lead at Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, leads the campaign here and said it could lend itself to support local and small businesses. He said overconsumption was a real problem and the solution was to move away from ""make, take and dispose"". For him, the answer to a circular model: make, take, remake, repair. And he hopes, over time, this will lead to people wanting to recycle. ""There's pressures on consumers 12 months of the year to consume, consume, consume,"" he added. ""We want consumers to take a pause and look at how they consume - not stop consuming, but just look at some other way to consume that's more responsible and healthier for the environment."" For Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, there's no doubt that traders have a part to play in reaching environmental targets such as reducing waste and hitting net zero. He points out that Retail NI members are part of initiatives such as the carrier bag levy, which ""brought over £14m into green and recyclable and sustainable projects"", and offering refill options so people can bring stock up on household projects by filling their own containers. ""I think reduction has a role to play, but certainly not in encouraging consumers not to spend,"" he said. Mr Roberts said he supported a ""green New Deal mark II"" but that it needed co-operation between environmental and business groups. ""It's only when we can co-design these efforts will we have that successful partnership approach and start to see the step-change and real change that we need to reach net zero."" Marie Nancarrow, from Titanic Denim which repurposes denim and other discarded fabrics, said she's always been a charity shop browser. ""I was taking pre-loved jeans and pre-loved garments, cutting up the garments and patching the jeans. And then I discovered that what I was actually doing was sustainable design,"" she said. The process creates bespoke pieces and helps the environment, she said - a win, win. ""I'm giving garments fabrics and materials a second life that they probably wouldn't have had before and would have ended up in landfill contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. ""I definitely believe there's a new movement, it's been happening over the last five years. That has been supported massively by social media. ""And, of course, that has given new ideas to people to be more conscious consumers, rather than to just buy constantly, and to look for other ways of buying clothes."" Ana Desmond, a senior economist at Ulster University Economic Policy Centre, said we need to move to a ""more circular economy where we reduce our consumption, reuse products, and then they're recycled as the final stage of the product"". ""It's really difficult, especially when we live in a world of influencers and large marketing campaigns where we're encouraged to buy and consume more,"" she said. ""So what we need to do is shift not only the mindset of consumers but of employers and creators as well manufacturers, so we move towards products that are more durable, but we also then need to market that durability, reusing and repairing products so that we get further use out of them and convey the benefits of those to consumers as well. ""We're talking about maybe moving people from industries and productions that are less efficient towards those that are more sustainable."" Ms Desmond said that the transition wouldn't happen overnight. ""It's a long transition, but it's something that's becoming more and more necessary as we see climate change coming more to the forefront of people's agendas."" You may remember a campaign from the turn of the century: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Recycling took off in a big way here - we now recycle 45.7% of our waste and some of it is recovered to be used for energy. But a quarter still goes to landfill. It's almost as though the first two steps of that slogan didn't really register. Reduce was first for a reason - when you cut down on what you are consuming, you will reduce what goes to landfill or for recycling. And recycling is the very final stage when an item's usefulness has been exhausted by reuse, repair and repurposing - finding new ways to support your local economy and protect the environment.","['Recycling', 'NI economy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/159E2/production/_132264588_chrisgourley.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10BC2/production/_132264586_glynnroberts.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BDA2/production/_132264584_marienancarrow.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11D88/production/_132269037_213d2657-7cac-42e0-802e-0f68da531af2_upload.jpg']","['By Louise Cullen', 'BBC NI agriculture and environment correspondent']",Science,Science

Strong winds flipped cars and knocked over homes in Florida, where several tornadoes were reported. More than 1,300 flights in or out of the US were cancelled on Tuesday, according to data from FlightAware. Vice-President Kamala Harris' plane had to be diverted due to weather. A spokesperson for Mrs Harris said that ""inclement weather"" required her plane from Atlanta to land in Virginia rather than neighbouring Maryland on her way back to Washington DC. As of Tuesday evening, more than 630,000 households in the eastern US, from Florida to New York State were without electricity. Gov Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 49 Florida counties, where storms have blown roofs off homes and knocked down power lines. Twelve tornadoes were reported across Florida, Alabama and Georgia by early Tuesday, causing significant damage and, in some areas, prompting search and rescue operations. More than 22 million people were under tornado watches. In Houston County, Alabama, an 81-year-old woman was reportedly killed after a tornado ripped through the area, destroying mobile homes and RVs. One person was killed and two others were critically injured in Claremont, North Carolina, officials said, after a powerful storm moved through a mobile home park. A motorist died in Clayton County, Georgia, officials said, after a tree fell across a highway and crushed the driver's car. And one man was also crushed to death by a toppled tree in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday morning, the local station WVTM reported, citing local officials. A resident of Panama City, Florida, who lives across from a home that was toppled by the wind said it sounded like a ""freight train hitting a brick wall"". ""That's how loud it was,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The storms also left roadways impassable in Panama City, ripped roofs off of buildings and brought hail the size of baseballs. A curfew has been declared for the city's downtown area until 06:00EST (11:00GMT) on Wednesday morning. ""No one should be moving around in this area after dark,"" the Bay County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that more powerful storms are in store for the region and elsewhere in the eastern US. In New Jersey, a coastal flood advisory is in effect until Wednesday. The state's governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and warned residents not to ""underestimate"" the storm. In New York State, Governor Kathy Hochul warned the storm could be ""life threatening"", especially as the expected rainfall would combine with the snow already blanketing the ground, bringing about potential flash-flooding. Around 2,000 migrants living in a city tent shelter on an airfield in Brooklyn were evacuated by authorities to high school gymnasiums until the storms pass. A ground stop was briefly issued at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport - one of the country's busiest - due to excessive snow and ice, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. A stop was also issued for Florida's Tampa International Airport due to a tornado warning. Severe weather has also disrupted road travel in states like Nebraska and Kansas, where state patrol has responded to hundreds of weather-related incidents. ""Please stay home,"" a Kansas state trooper wrote on social media. ""It's getting to the point where we will not be able to rescue you if you get stuck because we are having trouble getting around."" The NWS said it expects the extreme weather to slightly ease going into Wednesday, though snow showers are still possible in some of the already affected areas in the central US and the northeast. Flood warnings issued by the NWS remained in effect on Wednesday morning from Louisiana to Maine, encompassing at least 15 states along the US Atlantic coast.","['United States', 'Florida', 'Severe weather', 'Snow']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/03B2/production/_132264900_vlcsnap-2024-01-09-10h22m42s581.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/74F0/production/_132263992_gettyimages-1913163621.jpg']","['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",Science,Science

The notice of opinion to refuse was issued on Tuesday. Renewable energy firm RES wanted 14 turbines on Unshinagh mountain, in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Antrim Coast and Glens. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council previously expressed concern about the impact on tourism. Northern Ireland has a legally-binding target of generating 80% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2030. A statement said ""due cognisance"" had been given to ""the contribution that renewable energy can make to both the economy and tackling climate change"". But it added that the ""economic and environmental benefits"" had been outweighed by ""the significant harm that would be caused to the landscape"" and the ""ecological impacts"" on protected species"". RES had said the wind farm would be capable of generating enough power to supply 70,000 homes, as well as creating £24.7m in jobs and investment. Jennifer McCorry, the firm's senior development project manager, said it was extremely disappointed by the decision. She said that for Northern Ireland the project would help Northern Ireland to meet renewable energy targets and create up to £5m worth of wages in the 12-month construction period. The decision on the notice of opinion to refuse was taken by the department's permanent secretary under powers laid out in the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act 2022. It is legislation that allows officials to make certain decisions in the absence of ministers. The decision may be appealed up to six weeks after being made. It came as the NI Chamber of Commerce published proposals for the reform of the planning system. Its ideas include legal and regulatory changes alongside improving existing processes. It suggests that statutory consultees, which includes public bodies like NI Water, should face strict deadlines, after which it could be assumed they consent to a planning application. Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of NI Chamber, said: ""A well-performing planning function is key to instilling confidence in the market for potential investors and to enable the development of the required infrastructure, when it comes to connectivity, services, energy and reducing our carbon emissions.""","['Wind farms', 'NI economy', 'Wind power', 'Wind turbines', 'Renewable energy']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A858/production/_132269034_gettyimages-535137064.jpg'],"['By Louise Cullen', 'BBC NI agriculture and environment correspondent']",Science,Science

The court battle goes back to January last year when Mr Darwall, a hedge fund manager who owns a 4,000 acre (16 sq km) estate on Dartmoor, won a High Court challenge against wild camping.The victory led to thousands of people protesting and sparked a nationwide debate on public access in the English countryside.At the centre of this case was whether wild camping can be considered open-air recreation, which is allowed in the park under the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985.Lewis Winks of The Stars are for Everyone, said taking it to the Supreme Court was the ""final battle for the protection of historic rights to wild camp on Dartmoor"". He said: ""It is tying up the resources of the national park authority that could be better spent on education and getting more people outdoors and into this amazing environment.“I just hope that the court sees sense and ensures that wild camping remains as a part of enjoying Dartmoor.“Whatever the outcome it has galvanised huge amounts of support and we want to see the next government be bold and protect access to the countryside.”Environmental campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: ""The fact that a wealthy landowner is repeatedly seeking to extinguish the public’s right to responsibly wild camp on Dartmoor is a perfect demonstration of why we need new access legislation.""Dr Kevin Bishop, chief executive of Dartmoor National Park Authority, said: ""Naturally, we feel disappointed by the decision to allow the appeal.

Andrew Blenkiron, of the Euston Estate near Thetford in Suffolk, said the River Black Bourn had burst its banks several times in recent months. He said by storing the water, farmers could protect others against floods. Mr Blenkiron said he received a ""small payment"" from government to protect the grassland but has called on more compensation for farmers. ""There's about 100 acres of water behind me, usually grazed by sheep getting ready for lambing time. Further down the river towards Thetford there's a further 300-400 acres also underwater,"" he said. ""It is actually holding back some of the water, avoiding flooding Thetford."" Mr Blenkiron called on the government and eco-conscious big businesses to help fund making farmland more effective at storing water. But he explained there were already benefits for farmers, such as helping to create grassland ready for grazing by cattle and sheep in the summer. The stored water could also be pumped out onto fields during dry summer months, he said. ""It's clearly not suitable for everybody,"" Mr Blenkiron added. ""Those people with highly productive arable land that needs to be protected from flooding have got to be a priority. ""We've got to focus on producing food for everybody in this country, there's no question about that."" The farmer said he had seen up to 3in (8cm) of rainfall in one day. ""It's the intensity and frequency of those extremes that are now occurring that farmers on the frontline are faced with,"" he said. The National Farmers Union has said those who intentionally flood their land to protect people and property were ""performing a public good"" but has asked for more support, including from the Environment Agency. A Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman said it was ""acutely aware"" of the impact extreme weather had on farmers. ""Farmers who have suffered uninsurable damage to their land by exceptional flooding will be able to apply for grants of up to £25,000 through the farming recovery fund,"" they said.

Twenty-one local authorities have already implemented the ban, while Powys council has confirmed it will be joining them. It comes as part of the RSPCA's No Fun At The Fair campaign, which is calling for regulation on events which have historically given animals as rewards. But the charity says an outright Welsh government ban is needed to prevent the practice happening on private land. Sioned Nikolic, RSPCA Cymru's public affairs officer, said: ""Only a few months ago we were calling on 10 local authorities to take action and now we have all councils in agreement that this will not be happening on their land."" But the ban does not mean the practice cannot continue on private land. ""We know that this is something people care about, with many assuming it is already banned,"" she said. ""We would ultimately like to see pets being given away as prizes banned outrightly by the Welsh government."" Since 2020, there have been 42 reports about pets being given as prizes made to the RSPCA, but the charity fears many incidents go unreported. Goldfish are the animal most commonly associated with prize-giving, but the RSPCA says they are easily stressed and very often fish that are won as prizes suffer miserably from shock and oxygen starvation or die prematurely from changes in water temperature. Ms Nikolic added: ""They're misunderstood pets as they can make great companions, but can actually be challenging to look after. New owners must do their research before they acquire the fish, not afterwards. ""Before bringing a fish home for the first time, it's important to set the tank up at least two weeks in advance to make sure it's all running smoothly, and this just isn't possible for someone who's won a fish without being prepared for it.""","['Environment', 'RSPCA', 'Wales', 'Fish', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/863C/production/_125746343_gettyimages-131491177.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F4/production/_125746350_gettyimages-88374868.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Catriona Aitken', 'BBC News']",Science,Science
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67916306,Late barn owl brood in County Down causes surprise and shock,"A barn owl pair, considered to be one of Northern Ireland's most threatened farmland birds, have welcomed an ""extremely late"" winter brood.",2024-01-10,"A barn owl pair, considered to be one of Northern Ireland's most threatened farmland birds, have welcomed an ""extremely late"" winter brood. Four chicks were discovered at a nest in Ballycruttle Farm near Downpatrick, County Down in November. Conservation charity Ulster Wildlife said the brood was one of the latest recorded in Northern Ireland. Barn owl eggs are usually laid in April, with fledging beginning in June or July depending on the weather. However, the latest brood fledged - that is, learned to fly - in December, causing shock amongst conservationists. The barn owl is one of Northern Ireland's rarest birds and is red-listed on the Irish Birds of Conservation Concern and protected under the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985. There are fewer than 30 breeding pairs estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, which has made the discovery all the more exciting. Katy Bell, a senior conservation officer at Ulster Wildlife, said she ""couldn't believe"" it when she was sent an audio recording of the chicks snoring and rasping. ""A visit confirmed the exciting news, but our main concern was whether the chicks would survive given the extremely wet weather and floods,"" she said. Despite the fact barn owls struggle to hunt in wet conditions, Ms Bell added, the odds were in their favour as small mammals fleeing providing easy prey. The team returned a few weeks later and were ""ecstatic"" to bring in the four healthy chicks. ""This is the second consecutive year barn owls have bred at Ballycruttle Farm - a real testament to their wildlife-rich habitats and practices,"" Ms Bell added. However, the story behind the Ballycruttle brood is not too dissimilar to a typical soap opera plot. Last March, a clattering of jackdaws forced the female from her nest box to a nearby farm, managed by the Kelly family. The female and a nearby male, who had been hunting on the Kelly farm for many years, then bred and the pair had one chick late last summer. However, back in Ballycruttle, the male barn owl kept calling for the female to return. She eventually conceded, leaving the chick in the hands of the male who continued to feed it. With the pair reunited back in their original nest box, she then lay another clutch of eggs. Dawn Stocking of Ballycruttle Farm said the ""nail-biting"" story kept them on their toes. ""I was, of course, disappointed when the female jumped ship to my neighbour's fantastic farm and thought that we weren't going to see any chicks at Ballycruttle this year at all,"" she said. ""So, you can imagine my utter excitement when I heard babies snoring from the nest box - it was like Christmas had come early!"" Wildlife cameras were installed to catch the brood's antics, catching everything from wing stretches, small hops and even the chicks' first flights. ""It has been absolutely magical,"" Ms Stocking added. Both Ballycruttle Farm and Kelly's Farm are part of a project in County Down to halt and reserve the decline of barn owls led by RSPB NI. Michelle Duggan from the charity said it was a delight to see the work carried out by the nature-friendly farms yield positive results. ""The valuable seed-rich habitats maintained on both farms are an essential winter food source for the endangered yellowhammer, and also ideal hunting territory for barn owls to catch small mammal prey,"" she said. ""Healthy hedgerows combined with areas of rough grassland allow barn owls to expand their hunting territory even further.""

Andrew Dakin is the third generation of tenant farmers who have worked the land at Kidsley Farm, near Heanor. But plans for a new solar farm could see all his farming land sold off and solar panels put in place instead. Mr Dakin said it would be impossible for him to continue farming if Amber Valley Borough Council granted permission for the solar farm. The solar farm, which would be built on Mr Dakin's land, is one of two applications for neighbouring solar farms north of Derby and Smalley, which would sit 500m apart and cover an area of 328 acres. Mr Dakin said the farm on his land, which would span 180 acres, would take away all the fields he uses to rear cattle for beef and leave only the house he lives in. He told the BBC he would be enormously sad if he was forced to stop farming. He said: ""It's a way of life. It means absolutely everything and it would be devastating to see it go for a solar farm. ""It's all I've ever done - I've never been on holiday since I was 15 because I love being on the farm and I don't want to be anywhere else."" A spokesman for the solar farm developer, Intelligent Alternatives, said issues relating to land ownership and tenancy were private commercial matters. He said building on greenbelt land was allowed in special circumstances, such as tackling climate change, and pledged the land would be reinstated for agriculture afterwards. The spokesman added the full planning applications would not be submitted until after January and the community and councils would be kept informed. Amy Wheelton, who is a tenant farmer and local councillor who also sits on South Derbyshire District Council's planning committee, said she was alarmed at the number of applications being made for solar farms on agricultural land. ""Solar can be good,"" she said. ""I've no argument with somebody wanting to put it on their chicken sheds or their business. ""But you can have farmers that have been three generations farming, as I have on my tenanted land - some have invested millions in their businesses - and like that it's gone. ""There's no security of tenure and it's just wrong."" Ms Wheelton has solar panels covering her office rooftops and said it was ""crackers"" to use agricultural land for solar farms, as there was enough south-facing roof space in the UK to produce half the country's energy needs. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said the issue of tenant farmers being turfed off their land for solar farms was a ""huge and growing issue"" and called for a national database of solar schemes to illustrate the scale of the issue. He said: ""People are losing their businesses here for a pittance in terms of compensation. ""We're worried that food security is being damaged by the amount of land we're potentially going to see lost to solar schemes. ""We would much prefer this being put on to roofs of buildings and farm buildings and having microgeneration rather than these huge schemes taking the best and most versatile agricultural land out of production."" However, Sam Richards of Britain Remade, said moving quickly to renewable energy ""simply has to happen"". He said: ""If we truly believe that we have a climate emergency, if we really want to cut our energy bills, then fundamentally we're going to need to build.""

Prof Sarah Gabbott, of the University of Leicester, said there were countless numbers of aluminium cans and plastic bottles washed up by the River Soar. She said: ""The litter clogs up the river and causes even more flooding."" Prof Gabbott wants to educate people that litter is ""killing wildlife"" and ""ruining our beautiful river"". The professor, who researches plastic pollution in the environment, also spotted kitchen lino, fire extinguishers, car bumpers, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), tricycles, footballs, barbecues, and part of a kitchen cupboard in the wake of Storm Henk. She said: ""We had these incredible floods and what has happened is the water of the River Soar has risen, broken over the banks, and all the material that was in the river has been washed across the flood plain and now it is stranded so we can see it. ""It is very bad. I've travelled to a lot of developing countries to look at the plastic problems there and I'll be honest, this would fit in with those places and those places don't have waste management systems like we do here."" She says it spoils beautiful green spaces, the litter itself builds up and causes additional flooding, and it is terrible for wildlife and for ecology. Prof Gabbott added litter dropped on the streets often ended up washed into the river due to the rain. She said the flooding had ""brought into stark focus the appalling legacy of litter that Leicester's River Soar carries through our city and onwards into the Trent and then the North Sea"". Prof Gabbott, who saw the rubbish in the Ellis Meadows area while volunteering with the Green Circle Nature Regeneration CIC, added: ""I am shocked by the sheer abundance of litter that is now scattered across the river banks and snared on trees and bushes in the city where I live. ""It is like our dirty litter has been hung out to dry where we can all witness it."" She said ""you can almost not see the foliage"". ""It is just festooned in blue, white, red plastic bags, and material of all different colours and types,"" she said. ""It looks almost like there's a landfill, which has just been shoved into the River Soar. It's horrendous."" She said: ""What we really need is to stop it happening in the first place and that's where education is critical. I know that the city council are doing work around education, then there are various voluntary groups. ""We're taking kids out on the river on a boat, teaching them about the river, how it works, about nature, about the environment and how important it is. ""Hopefully they'll talk to their friends and family and stop this kind of littering happening again."" Chris Desai, founder of Leicester environmental charity UOcean, which cleans up waterways, said: ""We see this kind of pollution every day. ""When I saw it, I was just 'that's the River Soar and that's why we do this' but for the public to see, they are shocked beyond belief. ""We have been saying this is a problem for the past three years. ""We are going to keep highlighting the fact that our rivers in Leicester need our help."" Leicester City Council workers and volunteers have been cleaning up the land by the river over the last few days, and said clearing litter from the waterways was a constant challenge. Victoria Hudson, from the council, said: ""The efforts will be continually ongoing because this is just one of many sites along the eight-and-a-half mile stretch of the city's River Soar. ""As soon as we can get the boats back out on water, we will be back out with our volunteers as ever."" She added: ""We go the extra mile at Leicester and we have a fleet of boats.

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67410372,The last of the Moon men: the stories of the surviving Apollo astronauts,They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.,2024-01-10,"They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Now, more than 50 years on, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is set to heat up once again. A number of private companies are scheduled to send scientific craft to the Moon in 2024 - although the first of these, Peregrine, ran into trouble shortly after launch. And Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17, later this year but that date has slipped into 2025, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Nasa hopes the new programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. The programme's Ken Mattingly and Frank Borman died within a few days of each other late last year. Now only eight people who have voyaged beyond Earth orbit remain. Who are they, and what are their stories? On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement: many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars. ""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time. In December 1968, Bill Anders flew on Apollo 8, the first mission in which humans travelled beyond low Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for the fourth pass across its face, the crew witnessed an ""Earthrise"" for the first time in human history, Anders capturing the moment on film. The image is widely credited with motivating the global environmental movement and leading to the creation of Earth Day, an annual event to promote activism and awareness of caring for the planet. Speaking of the moment, Anders said: ""We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth."" Following his retirement from the space programme in 1969, Anders largely worked in the aerospace industry for several decades. He also served as US Ambassador to Norway for a year in the 1970s. There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC. In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Lovell, Borman and Anders made history when they undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. Jim Lovell is one of only three men to have travelled to the Moon twice, and following Frank Borman's death in November 2023, he became the oldest living astronaut. Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott, the commander of the Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon. As commander of Apollo 10 in May 1969, Tom Stafford led the final test mission for the programme before the planned landing of Apollo 11. On that mission, Stafford and pilot Eugene Cernan became the first crew to fly the lunar landing module outside Earth orbit. Shortly after his return, Stafford was appointed chief of the Astronaut Office, a role he held for almost two years. In 1975 he was Nasa's commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, the first joint space mission between the US and then-Soviet Union, and a precursor to the International Space Station. His Soviet counterpart, Alexey Leonov, became a lifelong friend. Together they had participated in the momentous handshake in orbit, something that would have been unimaginable at the height of the space race.

The Suffolk-born star created the four-minute film to back Suffolk Energy Action Solutions' (SEAS) call to build an offshore grid. ""The environmental legacy of any government is at stake,"" he said. However, National Grid has disputed Fiennes' claims that an offshore solution would be cheaper. Fiennes' four-minute film, called Coast, was launched on Tuesday alongside a SEAS nationwide petition to stop the current plans and push for a parliamentary debate. Opening with black-and-white footage of Fiennes as a toddler playing on Covehithe beach, the actor told how his father was a farmer in nearby Wangford. He spoke out against ""creating acres of steel and concrete in areas of profound natural beauty"". Fiennes, known for his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter franchise, said: ""[National Grid's] proposals involve a complex of electrical infrastructure with landfall at Aldeburgh, Walberswick, Southwold towards two vast electrical hubs, built inland destroying many acres of heathland and habitat, coastline and wetland irreversibly."" He also said neighbouring North Sea-sharing countries had harnessed wind power through integrated offshore networks. SEAS founder Fiona Gilmore said the star had offered to help before writing a script and filming with director Charles Sturridge. ""He feels passionately - he is a Suffolk lad and he could have been a farmer [but] he ended up being an actor,"" she said. ""We are incredibly grateful because it's the sort of film that makes me cry. ""We're hoping that hearing Ralph Fiennes talk about those offshore solutions and saying that they are viable, you can do them tomorrow... we think that people might sit up and listen."" Campaigners said they feared construction work on underground cables, a proposed energy hub at Friston and converter station near Saxmundham would not only be a blight to the countryside and residents, but also have a detrimental impact on tourism. They argued a better option was an offshore grid with substations on brownfield sites, such as Bradwell in Essex, and closer to demand. It could also mean proposals for 112-mile long (180km) route of pylons from Norwich in Norfolk via Bramford in Suffolk to Tilbury in Essex could be revised. Fiennes released his film on the same day National Grid met local politicians, MPs and community representatives in Friston. Jake Rigg, from National Grid's Electricity System Operator division, said the authority was conducting an independent study to look at all options and ""put some facts into the debate"". In a statement, National Grid disputed Fiennes' claims that an offshore solution would be cheaper, based on costs it published in 2023, and said an environmental impact assessment would be included in any plans. ""The existing electricity transmission network was built in the 1960s and was not designed to transport the clean, green, renewable energy from where it is generated out at sea, to homes and businesses across the country,"" the statement said. ""The Great Grid Upgrade is the largest overhaul of the grid in generations, and as electricity demand is set to double, it is a critical part of how the UK can lower energy bills, combat climate change, and reach net zero."" The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said householders living near any new infrastructure could receive up to £1,000 off their electricity bills. It said: ""Offshore wind will play a key part in delivering the transition to net zero, but without the development of necessary networks onshore, this ambition cannot be achieved, threatening energy security and increasing costs for hard-working families.""

The money from FCC Communities Foundation will be spent on the new Grimston wetscapes scheme near King's Lynn. Norfolk Wildlife Trust's (NWT) will manage the site, part of Roydon Common and Tony Hallatt Memorial Reserve. The reserve is one of the UK's most important lowland, wetland and heath landscapes, NWT said. The NWT wetland supports a range of plant and insect life, including rare or threatened UK species, such as black darter dragonfly, insectivorous sundew plants and the tormentil mining bee. Ash Murray, Norfolk Wildlife Trust's West Norfolk Reserves manager, said historically, these sites would have formed part of a vast chain of wetlands, but due to drainage, afforestation and development, almost all of the peatlands have been lost. ""Over the last 20 years, we have worked hard to restore the heathland and wetland habitats of these precious sites,"" he said. ""We've been thrilled to see so much rare and fascinating wildlife return - from incredible insect-eating plants and peat-forming mosses to rare fungi and an abundance of breeding wading birds. ""Our work will bring back to life [Grimston] wetlands that have been damaged by past pollution and climate change for the benefit of Norfolk's wildlife and people. ""In addition to helping to combat the impacts of climate change, we'll be providing thriving reservoirs of peatland species that can help to re-establish damaged peatlands elsewhere in west Norfolk."" Mr Murray said plant life to help slow water loss and carbon-capturing peat could start to re-colonise the site within the next three to five years. The works are due to be completed in March 2025.

No descriptions of the items or when they went missing were released and the Kensington design institution said it was ""standard practice to have a list of missing items as part of our regular auditing"". A V&A spokeswoman said the museum takes ""the protection of national collections very seriously and regularly reviews our security and collection management procedures"". ""This does not mean these objects have been stolen or lost, it might mean for example that a catalogue entry has not been updated after a collection move. Items are regularly recovered as a result of this process,"" they said. This group includes the National Maritime Museum, Queen's House, the Royal Observatory, Greenwich and Cutty Sark. About 245 items cannot be found, including a cannonball, a navigational aircraft computer, a gun-sighting telescope, charts, liquid compasses, an Act of Parliament, an Altazimuth circle (a mount for holding and rotating an instrument, such as telescopes) and ribbons and bands for caps. The museum said these could be ""ghost entries"" - the result of data transfer from more primitive databases: incorrect documentation or human error in the past. They have, however, re-discovered 560 items since 2008 through audits. A jaw fragment of a Late Triassic reptile, the Diphydontosaurus, was found to have been lost during a loan in 2019 - and the next year more than 180 fish were recorded as lost, and a crocodile tooth was discovered stolen in 2020. In the past three years, Cichlid fish were lost by researchers while on loan, 20 animal cells were destroyed from documentation not being presented while shipping a collection, and around 24 genomic tissues from octopi and birds were also lost when they were not properly refrigerated. Feathers, muscle, and liver from short-tailed shearwaters and fairy prions from Tasmania, Australia were also destroyed due to not being properly cooled and failing to be present for inspection. However, as these items were not catalogued, it is not clear how many samples were lost. A Natural History Museum spokesman said: ""We take the security of our collection very seriously, so over the last 20 years we've had just 23 instances of lost or missing items from a collection of 80 million, limited to small things like teeth, fish and frozen animal tissue. ""We have robust security measures in place which we regularly review. ""As a world-leading science centre, it's important that researchers from around the world have access to our collection to help find solutions to the planetary emergency."" The body includes the Science Museum in South Kensington, the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, the National Railway Museum in York, the Locomotion Museum in Shildon, Co Durham and the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford. In 2014, the group reported to police the theft of two model steam trains, a King George V and a British Railways Standard 4MT class. The museum also has recorded as missing a 1960s model of a deep-sea observation chamber, a diver's watertight torch, resuscitating apparatus and a 19th-century portrait of Joseph Marie Jacquard (who developed a programmable loom). The group, which houses 425,000 objects across its venues and centres, has begun putting barcodes on artefacts to track their locations and keep them safe. Seven artefacts, including a 1933 protective charm are missing from the Horniman, which has displays of anthropology, natural history and musical instruments, and is known for its large collection of taxidermy animals. It said it has ""reviewed"" security in light of thefts at the British Museum ""as a precautionary measure"". More than 550 objects, made up of ship camouflage drawings, British Army officer's private papers, a calendar with a photograph of former Iraq leader Saddam Hussein and currency notes, were disclosed by the Imperial War Museum when asked about missing items. A museum spokesman said the artefacts ""date from many years or even decades ago, long before our current collections management systems were put in place"" and ""are also typically low-value, mass-produced items"". It emerged in November that a 19th-Century cannon from the Royal Armouries collection was stolen from a remote and off-site location. It was claimed to be a metal theft, meaning the cannon was thought to have been taken for its scrap value, rather than stolen as a ""collection object"". A pair of mounted sword bayonets also disappeared while on loan from the museum. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67410372,The last of the Moon men: the stories of the surviving Apollo astronauts,They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.,2024-01-10,"They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Now, more than 50 years on, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is set to heat up once again. A number of private companies are scheduled to send scientific craft to the Moon in 2024 - although the first of these, Peregrine, ran into trouble shortly after launch. And Nasa had intended to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition since Apollo 17, later this year but that date has slipped into 2025, as the space agency says it needs more time to prepare. Nasa hopes the new programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also aiming to have people on the lunar surface by 2030. These delays highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. The programme's Ken Mattingly and Frank Borman died within a few days of each other late last year. Now only eight people who have voyaged beyond Earth orbit remain. Who are they, and what are their stories? On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement: many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars. ""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time. In December 1968, Bill Anders flew on Apollo 8, the first mission in which humans travelled beyond low Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for the fourth pass across its face, the crew witnessed an ""Earthrise"" for the first time in human history, Anders capturing the moment on film. The image is widely credited with motivating the global environmental movement and leading to the creation of Earth Day, an annual event to promote activism and awareness of caring for the planet. Speaking of the moment, Anders said: ""We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth."" Following his retirement from the space programme in 1969, Anders largely worked in the aerospace industry for several decades. He also served as US Ambassador to Norway for a year in the 1970s. There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC. In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Lovell, Borman and Anders made history when they undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. Jim Lovell is one of only three men to have travelled to the Moon twice, and following Frank Borman's death in November 2023, he became the oldest living astronaut. Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott, the commander of the Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon. As commander of Apollo 10 in May 1969, Tom Stafford led the final test mission for the programme before the planned landing of Apollo 11. On that mission, Stafford and pilot Eugene Cernan became the first crew to fly the lunar landing module outside Earth orbit. Shortly after his return, Stafford was appointed chief of the Astronaut Office, a role he held for almost two years. In 1975 he was Nasa's commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, the first joint space mission between the US and then-Soviet Union, and a precursor to the International Space Station. His Soviet counterpart, Alexey Leonov, became a lifelong friend. Together they had participated in the momentous handshake in orbit, something that would have been unimaginable at the height of the space race.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-67925436,Ralph Fiennes adds voice to campaign against 112-mile pylons route,Hollywood actor Ralph Fiennes has made a film campaigning against plans to install electricity hubs and pylons across the area where he grew up.,2024-01-10,"Hollywood actor Ralph Fiennes has made a film campaigning against plans to install electricity hubs and pylons across the area where he grew up. The Suffolk-born star created the four-minute film to back Suffolk Energy Action Solutions' (SEAS) call to build an offshore grid. ""The environmental legacy of any government is at stake,"" he said. However, National Grid has disputed Fiennes' claims that an offshore solution would be cheaper. Fiennes' four-minute film, called Coast, was launched on Tuesday alongside a SEAS nationwide petition to stop the current plans and push for a parliamentary debate. Opening with black-and-white footage of Fiennes as a toddler playing on Covehithe beach, the actor told how his father was a farmer in nearby Wangford. He spoke out against ""creating acres of steel and concrete in areas of profound natural beauty"". Fiennes, known for his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter franchise, said: ""[National Grid's] proposals involve a complex of electrical infrastructure with landfall at Aldeburgh, Walberswick, Southwold towards two vast electrical hubs, built inland destroying many acres of heathland and habitat, coastline and wetland irreversibly."" He also said neighbouring North Sea-sharing countries had harnessed wind power through integrated offshore networks. SEAS founder Fiona Gilmore said the star had offered to help before writing a script and filming with director Charles Sturridge. ""He feels passionately - he is a Suffolk lad and he could have been a farmer [but] he ended up being an actor,"" she said. ""We are incredibly grateful because it's the sort of film that makes me cry. ""We're hoping that hearing Ralph Fiennes talk about those offshore solutions and saying that they are viable, you can do them tomorrow... we think that people might sit up and listen."" Campaigners said they feared construction work on underground cables, a proposed energy hub at Friston and converter station near Saxmundham would not only be a blight to the countryside and residents, but also have a detrimental impact on tourism. They argued a better option was an offshore grid with substations on brownfield sites, such as Bradwell in Essex, and closer to demand. It could also mean proposals for 112-mile long (180km) route of pylons from Norwich in Norfolk via Bramford in Suffolk to Tilbury in Essex could be revised. Fiennes released his film on the same day National Grid met local politicians, MPs and community representatives in Friston. Jake Rigg, from National Grid's Electricity System Operator division, said the authority was conducting an independent study to look at all options and ""put some facts into the debate"". In a statement, National Grid disputed Fiennes' claims that an offshore solution would be cheaper, based on costs it published in 2023, and said an environmental impact assessment would be included in any plans. ""The existing electricity transmission network was built in the 1960s and was not designed to transport the clean, green, renewable energy from where it is generated out at sea, to homes and businesses across the country,"" the statement said. ""The Great Grid Upgrade is the largest overhaul of the grid in generations, and as electricity demand is set to double, it is a critical part of how the UK can lower energy bills, combat climate change, and reach net zero."" The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said householders living near any new infrastructure could receive up to £1,000 off their electricity bills. It said: ""Offshore wind will play a key part in delivering the transition to net zero, but without the development of necessary networks onshore, this ambition cannot be achieved, threatening energy security and increasing costs for hard-working families.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67932741,Adan Canto: X-Men and Designated Survivor star dies of cancer at 42,"Actor Adan Canto, who was known for US TV shows like Designated Survivor and films including X-Men: Days of Future Past, has died at the age of 42.",2024-01-10,"Actor Adan Canto, who was known for US TV shows like Designated Survivor and films including X-Men: Days of Future Past, has died at the age of 42. The Mexican star had suffered from appendiceal cancer, his publicist said. Canto was the national security adviser in Designated Survivor alongside Kiefer Sutherland, who paid tribute to the actor as ""such a wonderful spirit"". In the 2014 X-Men film, Canto played mutant Sunspot, and co-star Halle Berry later cast him in her movie Bruised. The actress and director wrote on Instagram: ""I don't have the words just yet… but my dear sweet friend Adan just gained his wings. Forever, forever in my heart."" Canto's wife Stephanie Ann posted a photo of the couple, a Bible passage and the words: ""Forever my treasure Adan, see you soon."" In a statement, his publicist Jennifer Allen said: ""Adan had a depth of spirit that few truly knew. Those who glimpsed it were changed forever. He will be greatly missed by so many."" In his message, Sutherland added: ""As an actor his desire to do well, to be great, and then do better, was truly impressive and he will be greatly missed. I am also heartbroken for his wife, Steph and his two young children. Adan, may you rest in peace."" Canto played Aaron Shore in Designated Survivor, which aired on the ABC network in 2016 and 17 before being picked up by Netflix for a third and final season. Co-star Maggie Q wrote: ""Beautiful friend… You are the level of person that Hollywood didn't even deserve. Kindness and warmth and generosity of spirit - total dedication to your family, and ALWAYS doing the right thing. No one had your moral compass nor did they even come close. ""I don't understand this. Anyone who knew you was a lucky one. That's all I do know."" Italia Ricci, another Designated Survivor castmate, wrote that she was ""completely lost for words"". ""He was the strongest person I know in every sense of the word and I am so angry that this happened. No-one deserved this less than this sweet, brilliant, kind, and gentle man... ""I'm so sorry for everyone hurting at this devastating loss and am beyond heartbroken for his family. You'll be in my heart always."" Canto went on to star as gangster Arman Morales in Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady in 2022. ""He'll always be our Arman,"" Fox posted on X. ""Adan Canto, your memory will be cherished forever."" In a joint statement, Fox and Warner Bros Television described him as ""a wonderful actor and dear friend"". ""Most recently, he lit up the screen in The Cleaning Lady with a powerful performance that showcased his artistry, range, depth and vulnerability,"" the broadcasters said.

The image showed a group of men with shaved heads. One had the words ""Gas Me Up"" tattooed across his head. People quickly drew parallels between the photograph and the deaths of Jewish people in Nazi gas chambers during World War Two. Skepta later apologised and acknowledged the potential for offence. ""I've been waiting to drop Gas Me Up (Diligent) since teasing it April last year, worked hard getting the artwork right for my album rollout which is about my parents coming to the UK in the 80's, skinhead, football culture and it has been taken offensively by many,"" the rapper wrote on social media. ""I can honestly see how my single artwork without context can be deemed offensive, especially in a time like this,"" he continued, adding: ""I vow to be more mindful going forward."" The Mercury Prize-winning musician later shared the ""mood board"" for his album on X (formerly Twitter). The collage included 1980s images of football hooligans, skinheads and prison canteens, as well as the logo for 2 Tone Records - whose multi-racial acts, including the Specials and the Selecter, made a point of standing up to bigotry. Skepta said he'd decided to post the imagery after further reflection on the backlash surrounding Gas Me Up, whose title is slang for hyping someone up or praising them. ""I don't feel like I could continue being the artist you all know and love if my art is policed"" he wrote. ""So to help with context here are some pictures from our mood board for the 1980s UK story for my album Knife & Fork."" Artist Gabriel Moses, who created the artwork for Gas Me Up, also reposted Skepta's initial statement to his Instagram account. Later, he shared a clip of Beanie Sigel's music video Feel It In The Air, captioned: ""Last 24 hours"". The video showed the rapper's house being surrounded and raided by police. Last November, Skepta revealed that he would stage his own festival at London's Crystal Palace Park on 6 July, 2024. He followed that up by announcing his first album in five years, Knife and Fork, on New Year's Day. ""It's been years since I dropped my last album and I want to thank you for all the love during my hiatus,"" he wrote alongside the announcement. ""I've seen the messages, tweets and TikToks, I'm truly grateful that my music is still resonating with the world even in my absence."" The album will be accompanied by a film. Tribal Mark, which follows the journey of a Nigerian immigrant navigating life in a foreign land. Gas Me Up is still planned as the album's first single, due for release on 26 January. The lyrics find the star in boisterous, boastful form - revelling in his successes in music, fashion and on the acclaimed TV show Top Boy.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67921673,The power of Mr Bates vs The Post Office in bringing about justice,"The million dollar question in journalism, if little known outside the industry, is ""cut through"" - how can a story be made to not only reach an audience, but keep them hooked.",2024-01-10,"The million dollar question in journalism, if little known outside the industry, is ""cut through"" - how can a story be made to not only reach an audience, but keep them hooked. It is a challenge that investigative journalist Nick Wallis, one of the key voices to first expose the Post Office scandal that began at the turn of the millennium, will know all too well. His work helped give a voice to over 700 workers prosecuted after faulty Post Office software, known as Horizon, made it appear that money was missing. The fight for justice in the decades since has seen Wallis publish his own book on the scandal (serialised in the Daily Mail), alongside investigations by BBC Panorama, Computer Weekly and Private Eye amongst others. But 25 years on from the first convictions for theft and fraud, it is the four-part ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office that has renewed mass public interest in the scandal like never before. Watched by nine million viewers so far according to ITV figures, the mini-series centres on the story of sub-postmaster Alan Bates, played by actor Toby Jones, who led and won a legal battle paving the way for dozens of convictions to be overturned. Since the series began airing on 1 January, more than 100 new potential victims have contacted lawyers, some of whom were former sub-postmasters prosecuted by the Post Office. Westminster has tried to keep pace, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling the case an ""appalling miscarriage of justice"" in an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday. The government is now under pressure to overturn wrongful convictions and deal with compensation, with ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells agreeing to hand back her CBE in response to the public outcry. It marks a long-awaited breakthrough for victims. But why now, and why in response to a TV show? For the show's executive producer Patrick Spence, it proves the unique power drama can hold in forging human connection. He told BBC Radio 4: ""Drama can go inside the homes of the sub-postmasters who so suffered and dramatise the pain that they went through. ""[It] can do something that a documentary and a newspaper article can't… they can bring to life the true emotional impact on the people who were victimised by the Post Office's abhorrent behaviour."" But these two mediums, rather than working in competition, often complement each other to forge a lasting impact, says arts writer Fiona Sturges. ""I think it's easy to look at the media as a separate entity when so often these types of dramas are inspired by stories painstakingly researched over years by journalists. ""But I also think TV dramas can bring a level of humanity and colour that print media can't always manage, largely due to limits on space and reach."" The response is far from the first time a docudrama has caught public attention and put politicians under pressure to act. Cathy Come Home, Ken Loach's BBC television play about homelessness, sparked a huge public reaction when first broadcast in 1966. As Mark Lawson wrote in the Guardian, the charities Crisis and Shelter ""doubtless benefitted"" from the parliamentary debate and raised awareness of disadvantage that followed the drama. Sturges adds that it allowed audiences to ""really dwell on what that would be like and to create a space where statistics become people with complex characters and stories"". In a similar vein, she says Jimmy McGovern's Hillsborough, which dramatised the fight for justice by the families of 97 Liverpool fans killed during the Sheffield Wednesday stadium crush in 1989, took the uneasiness and ugliness gleaned from extensive journalism on the topic and turned it into an ""emotionally-charged human story"". Centred around the two years after the tragedy when the original inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death in 1991, its airing five years later helped solidify a shift in public opinion. When the verdicts were eventually overturned in 2016 and the deaths ruled unlawful, then-Walton MP Steve Rotheram called the docudrama ""massively influential"" in pushing for the truth. McGovern told the BBC he was approached to make the drama by the Hillsborough families not because the story wasn't known, but because it was framed in a certain way - and a docudrama turned the narrative around. It made it a story about institutional failure after fans had wrongfully been blamed for the disaster. It made the families the heroes and rightful victims of the story. This same sense of indignation has been present in the reaction to Mr Bates, says Spence, who sees the response in political terms. ""As a country we feel unheard by our politicians and by our government. And I think what this drama seems to have done is tapped into that rage. ""Our ambition was simply to allow them to feel that their story was heard… but what people have connected with I think is a sense that nobody is listening to the people that deserve it the most."" The frenzied political and state response, then, including potentially passing a specific law to exonerate those affected, can be seen as an act of preservation. ""There is a growing feeling that the public mood, prompted by the drama, leaves those in government with no alternative but to act, be seen to act, and to do so quickly"", wrote BBC political editor Chris Mason on Tuesday. Toby Jones, the actor portraying Mr Bates, believes the response shows the enduring value of drama in progressing public awareness and national debates. ""Drama is constantly downgraded as a subject of importance, but it's historically always been a place that people, even if they don't believe that it can deliver change, nevertheless it suggests change… and so it cannot be ignored. ""In most of the political upheavals in history, not least ancient Greece and revolutionary Russia, that drama has been at the centre of political change, that people have used it to humanise, dramatise and bring forth change.""

Radio City, which has broadcast from St John's Beacon since 1974, will become Hits Radio Liverpool as part of a rebrand of Bauer Media's stations. The beacon was given listed status in 2020 and its listing includes a reference to the Radio City branding. Bauer Media said it was ""reviewing all options"" in terms of its future. It acknowledged the importance of the branding, as it is known locally as the Radio City Tower. It can be seen around the city, and from the waterfront forms part of the skyline along with the Liver Building, the Cunard building and the Port of Liverpool building. The station is one of 15 to be rebranded by Bauer - including Sheffield's Hallam FM which will become Hits Radio South Yorkshire, and Preston's Rock FM which will become Hits Radio Lancashire. Bauer Media Audio UK CEO Simon Myciunka said it was a ""brand new chapter"" for the stations, transforming it into a ""nationally-recognised brand"". A spokesman for the company said St John's Beacon housed its breakfast show and local teams, along with its sister station Greatest Hits Radio. Its show ""Greatest Hits at Breakfast with Rossie"" is broadcast live from the tower each weekday morning. The spokesman said: ""An iconic landmark of the city, we're sensitive to the history its branding holds while also being open to options that better reflect its new era as home to Hits Radio and Greatest Hits Radio. ""We're reviewing all options and will share updates in due course."" Reacting on X, listeners said it was a shame to see the name go from the radio station, with some saying they would no longer listen. Replying to a Radio City post, one listener said: ""As a radio lover & admirer of Liverpool, I am very saddened at this change, just shy of your 50th anniversary & I know this will be felt by many down there. ""Radio City's contribution to Liverpool & Merseyside in general since 1974 has been exemplary & the name will be missed.""

The Stoke-on-Trent station will become Hits Radio in April along with 14 other Bauer Media Group stations, including four West Midlands Free Radio services. The traditionally local stations have already been permitted to broadcast just three hours a day of non-national programmes on weekdays. Bauer said there would be no scheduling or local presenter changes. Stations would retain their breakfast shows, the company confirmed. The Hits Radio brand has already emerged on some FM stations around England, including in Manchester on the service once known as Piccadilly Radio - one of the country's first independent local radio stations. Signal Radio - now known as Signal 1 on FM - began broadcasting from Stoke-on-Trent in September 1983. Its broadcasters have included former BBC Radio 1 breakfast presenter Chris Moyles and TV presenter Anthea Turner. During its history, it provided a choice of Signal services, including Signal 2, which played older hit records. But it emerged last month its Stoke-on-Trent studios were up for sale with an asking price of £600,000 and Bauer said its Signal 1 broadcast team would move to Birmingham this year. Free Radio will go after 12 years, after those stations' previous names, used for more than three decades, were dropped in 2012. The oldest were BRMB, which began in Birmingham in 1974, and Black Country-based Beacon. It started in 1976 and in 1987 launched a service for Shropshire. Mercia, for Coventry and Warwickshire, began in 1980 and Wyvern for Herefordshire and Worcestershire started in 1982. Guidelines from regulator Ofcom now allow stations to broadcast national programmes for most of the day.

Succession, Beef, The Crown, Ted Lasso and The Bear are among the nominees in the television categories. While DiCaprio is a notable omission in best actor, this is a particularly crowded year for the category, and five of the other favourites have been nominated at the SAG Awards. Bradley Cooper, Colman Domingo, Paul Giamatti, Cillian Murphy and Jeffrey Wright are all recognised. In the best actress race, three of the women considered favourites for an Oscar nomination - Emma Stone, Lily Gladstone and Carey Mulligan - are joined at SAG by Margot Robbie for Barbie and Annette Bening for Nyad. The SAG Awards offer a good indication of which actors could be nominated later this month for the Oscars. This year's Academy Awards take place on 10 March. In the TV categories, the most notable absence is Succession's Jeremy Strong - but his co-stars Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook, Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen are all nominated. Oppenheimer and Succession were the big winners at Sunday's Golden Globes, while Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers, Barbie and Poor Things won two prizes each.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67921673,The power of Mr Bates vs The Post Office in bringing about justice,"The million dollar question in journalism, if little known outside the industry, is ""cut through"" - how can a story be made to not only reach an audience, but keep them hooked.",2024-01-10,"The million dollar question in journalism, if little known outside the industry, is ""cut through"" - how can a story be made to not only reach an audience, but keep them hooked. It is a challenge that investigative journalist Nick Wallis, one of the key voices to first expose the Post Office scandal that began at the turn of the millennium, will know all too well. His work helped give a voice to over 700 workers prosecuted after faulty Post Office software, known as Horizon, made it appear that money was missing. The fight for justice in the decades since has seen Wallis publish his own book on the scandal (serialised in the Daily Mail), alongside investigations by BBC Panorama, Computer Weekly and Private Eye amongst others. But 25 years on from the first convictions for theft and fraud, it is the four-part ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office that has renewed mass public interest in the scandal like never before. Watched by nine million viewers so far according to ITV figures, the mini-series centres on the story of sub-postmaster Alan Bates, played by actor Toby Jones, who led and won a legal battle paving the way for dozens of convictions to be overturned. Since the series began airing on 1 January, more than 100 new potential victims have contacted lawyers, some of whom were former sub-postmasters prosecuted by the Post Office. Westminster has tried to keep pace, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling the case an ""appalling miscarriage of justice"" in an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday. The government is now under pressure to overturn wrongful convictions and deal with compensation, with ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells agreeing to hand back her CBE in response to the public outcry. It marks a long-awaited breakthrough for victims. But why now, and why in response to a TV show? For the show's executive producer Patrick Spence, it proves the unique power drama can hold in forging human connection. He told BBC Radio 4: ""Drama can go inside the homes of the sub-postmasters who so suffered and dramatise the pain that they went through. ""[It] can do something that a documentary and a newspaper article can't… they can bring to life the true emotional impact on the people who were victimised by the Post Office's abhorrent behaviour."" But these two mediums, rather than working in competition, often complement each other to forge a lasting impact, says arts writer Fiona Sturges. ""I think it's easy to look at the media as a separate entity when so often these types of dramas are inspired by stories painstakingly researched over years by journalists. ""But I also think TV dramas can bring a level of humanity and colour that print media can't always manage, largely due to limits on space and reach."" The response is far from the first time a docudrama has caught public attention and put politicians under pressure to act. Cathy Come Home, Ken Loach's BBC television play about homelessness, sparked a huge public reaction when first broadcast in 1966. As Mark Lawson wrote in the Guardian, the charities Crisis and Shelter ""doubtless benefitted"" from the parliamentary debate and raised awareness of disadvantage that followed the drama. Sturges adds that it allowed audiences to ""really dwell on what that would be like and to create a space where statistics become people with complex characters and stories"". In a similar vein, she says Jimmy McGovern's Hillsborough, which dramatised the fight for justice by the families of 97 Liverpool fans killed during the Sheffield Wednesday stadium crush in 1989, took the uneasiness and ugliness gleaned from extensive journalism on the topic and turned it into an ""emotionally-charged human story"". Centred around the two years after the tragedy when the original inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death in 1991, its airing five years later helped solidify a shift in public opinion. When the verdicts were eventually overturned in 2016 and the deaths ruled unlawful, then-Walton MP Steve Rotheram called the docudrama ""massively influential"" in pushing for the truth. McGovern told the BBC he was approached to make the drama by the Hillsborough families not because the story wasn't known, but because it was framed in a certain way - and a docudrama turned the narrative around. It made it a story about institutional failure after fans had wrongfully been blamed for the disaster. It made the families the heroes and rightful victims of the story. This same sense of indignation has been present in the reaction to Mr Bates, says Spence, who sees the response in political terms. ""As a country we feel unheard by our politicians and by our government. And I think what this drama seems to have done is tapped into that rage. ""Our ambition was simply to allow them to feel that their story was heard… but what people have connected with I think is a sense that nobody is listening to the people that deserve it the most."" The frenzied political and state response, then, including potentially passing a specific law to exonerate those affected, can be seen as an act of preservation. ""There is a growing feeling that the public mood, prompted by the drama, leaves those in government with no alternative but to act, be seen to act, and to do so quickly"", wrote BBC political editor Chris Mason on Tuesday. Toby Jones, the actor portraying Mr Bates, believes the response shows the enduring value of drama in progressing public awareness and national debates. ""Drama is constantly downgraded as a subject of importance, but it's historically always been a place that people, even if they don't believe that it can deliver change, nevertheless it suggests change… and so it cannot be ignored. ""In most of the political upheavals in history, not least ancient Greece and revolutionary Russia, that drama has been at the centre of political change, that people have used it to humanise, dramatise and bring forth change."" BBC Panorama's Post Office investigation will be rebroadcast tonight at 22:40 on BBC One.

The Mexican star had suffered from appendiceal cancer, his publicist said. Canto was the national security adviser in Designated Survivor alongside Kiefer Sutherland, who paid tribute to the actor as ""such a wonderful spirit"". In the 2014 X-Men film, Canto played mutant Sunspot, and co-star Halle Berry later cast him in her movie Bruised. The actress and director wrote on Instagram: ""I don't have the words just yet… but my dear sweet friend Adan just gained his wings. Forever, forever in my heart."" Canto's wife Stephanie Ann posted a photo of the couple, a Bible passage and the words: ""Forever my treasure Adan, see you soon."" In a statement, his publicist Jennifer Allen said: ""Adan had a depth of spirit that few truly knew. Those who glimpsed it were changed forever. He will be greatly missed by so many."" In his message, Sutherland added: ""As an actor his desire to do well, to be great, and then do better, was truly impressive and he will be greatly missed. I am also heartbroken for his wife, Steph and his two young children. Adan, may you rest in peace."" Canto played Aaron Shore in Designated Survivor, which aired on the ABC network in 2016 and 17 before being picked up by Netflix for a third and final season. Co-star Maggie Q wrote: ""Beautiful friend… You are the level of person that Hollywood didn't even deserve. Kindness and warmth and generosity of spirit - total dedication to your family, and ALWAYS doing the right thing. No one had your moral compass nor did they even come close. ""I don't understand this. Anyone who knew you was a lucky one. That's all I do know."" Italia Ricci, another Designated Survivor castmate, wrote that she was ""completely lost for words"". ""He was the strongest person I know in every sense of the word and I am so angry that this happened. No-one deserved this less than this sweet, brilliant, kind, and gentle man... ""I'm so sorry for everyone hurting at this devastating loss and am beyond heartbroken for his family. You'll be in my heart always."" Canto went on to star as gangster Arman Morales in Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady in 2022. ""He'll always be our Arman,"" Fox posted on X. ""Adan Canto, your memory will be cherished forever."" In a joint statement, Fox and Warner Bros Television described him as ""a wonderful actor and dear friend"". ""Most recently, he lit up the screen in The Cleaning Lady with a powerful performance that showcased his artistry, range, depth and vulnerability,"" the broadcasters said. ""This is an unfathomable loss, and we grieve alongside his wife Stephanie, their children and loved ones. We will miss Adan dearly."" Canto made his breakthrough in the US in Fox thriller The Following with Kevin Bacon in 2013, and appeared in ABC sitcom Mixology and drama Blood & Oil. He also appeared as Colombian politician Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in Netflix's Narcos, and his film credits included spy thriller Agent Game in 2022.","['Television', 'Film']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1227E/production/_132266347_gettyimages-1246511877.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FB6E/production/_132266346_gettyimages-613828510.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D45E/production/_132266345_gettyimages-492292581.jpg']","['By Ian Youngs', 'Entertainment & arts reporter']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

Emily Wadds' daughter, Lydia, has a profound and multiple learning disability, is non-verbal, a full-time wheelchair user and has epilepsy. But after accessing the charity Soundabout, Mrs Wadds said: ""I don't think I've ever known her better."" Mrs Wadds, from Trowbridge, said that learning about Lydia's expressions and noises has helped bring them together. The pair have been accessing Soundabout's online music sessions for around four years. ""Music has brought us much, much closer together,"" Mrs Wadds, 52, told BBC Radio Wiltshire. ""She's non verbal, so she doesn't talk, but just to hear her voice, I really can recognise her happy noises now - she does this little cluck."" Regular seizures meant that Lydia made little noise in her early years, but with music in Lydia's life, Mrs Wadds said she has seen a real difference in her daughter. ""We barely got any noise from her, she didn't laugh for years,"" she said. ""Now she makes lots of different noises that she never did before and I think it's given her confidence to make the noises, she's exploring more with her vocal cords."" Mrs Wadds said that discovering Soundabout also gave her the opportunity to enjoy time with Lydia. ""When she was little I was watching her all the time,"" she said. ""It was all about making sure she was safe, looking out for seizures, monitoring seizures, videoing seizures, talking about seizures - it was all health related. ""Finding Soundabout, I watch her, but it's for an enjoyable purpose - looking at her eyes and looking at her expressions, listening to her noises. ""I think it's one of the most important things in her life actually - music and food."" Rebecca Thomas has worked in special educational needs music for 15 years after studying music at Goldsmiths, University of London. She now works as a Soundabout family support coordinator. ""Music is so universal, it connects people in so many different ways,"" Miss Thomas said. ""It doesn't matter what language you speak or how you communicate - whether you communicate with vocalisations, without vocalisations, body language - music enhances all of those interactions. ""It's a way for us all to meet in the middle. ""Lydia has all these incredible ways of communicating. I feel like music is just that tool to uphold all of the things she wants to tell us.""

The image showed a group of men with shaved heads. One had the words ""Gas Me Up"" tattooed across his head. People quickly drew parallels between the photograph and the deaths of Jewish people in Nazi gas chambers during World War Two. Skepta later apologised and acknowledged the potential for offence. ""I've been waiting to drop Gas Me Up (Diligent) since teasing it April last year, worked hard getting the artwork right for my album rollout which is about my parents coming to the UK in the 80's, skinhead, football culture and it has been taken offensively by many,"" the rapper wrote on social media. ""I can honestly see how my single artwork without context can be deemed offensive, especially in a time like this,"" he continued, adding: ""I vow to be more mindful going forward."" The Mercury Prize-winning musician later shared the ""mood board"" for his album on X (formerly Twitter). The collage included 1980s images of football hooligans, skinheads and prison canteens, as well as the logo for 2 Tone Records - whose multi-racial acts, including the Specials and the Selecter, made a point of standing up to bigotry. Skepta said he'd decided to post the imagery after further reflection on the backlash surrounding Gas Me Up, whose title is slang for hyping someone up or praising them. ""I don't feel like I could continue being the artist you all know and love if my art is policed"" he wrote. ""So to help with context here are some pictures from our mood board for the 1980s UK story for my album Knife & Fork."" Artist Gabriel Moses, who created the artwork for Gas Me Up, also reposted Skepta's initial statement to his Instagram account. Later, he shared a clip of Beanie Sigel's music video Feel It In The Air, captioned: ""Last 24 hours"". The video showed the rapper's house being surrounded and raided by police. Last November, Skepta revealed that he would stage his own festival at London's Crystal Palace Park on 6 July, 2024. He followed that up by announcing his first album in five years, Knife and Fork, on New Year's Day. ""It's been years since I dropped my last album and I want to thank you for all the love during my hiatus,"" he wrote alongside the announcement. ""I've seen the messages, tweets and TikToks, I'm truly grateful that my music is still resonating with the world even in my absence."" The album will be accompanied by a film. Tribal Mark, which follows the journey of a Nigerian immigrant navigating life in a foreign land. Gas Me Up is still planned as the album's first single, due for release on 26 January. The lyrics find the star in boisterous, boastful form - revelling in his successes in music, fashion and on the acclaimed TV show Top Boy. He also references his musical hiatus, rapping: ""I'm talking about taking a year out, still, I can't see no competition / Can't see anyone threatening my position.""","['Music', 'Grime', 'Skepta']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/177A6/production/_132266169_gettyimages-692302910.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/12986/production/_132266167_gettyimages-810887914.jpg']","['By Mark Savage', 'BBC Music Correspondent']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67860456,All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.",2024-01-10,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique. In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant. It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180: £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more. But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam. Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman. So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others. But finding the victims has proved more tricky. ""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained. The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers. ""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me. The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate. They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived. ""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me. Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"". The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me. I ask him if he still trusts the scammers. ""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call. ""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67917294,Scientists crack mystery of how MS gene spread,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts?",2024-01-10,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts? An international team of scientists say they have unearthed the answer in the DNA of ancient teeth and bones. The genes which protected our ancestors from animal diseases now raise the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The researchers call their discovery ""a quantum leap"" in understanding the evolution of the disease. And they say it could change opinions on what causes MS, and have an impact on the way it is treated. There are about twice as many cases of multiple sclerosis per 100,000 people in north-western Europe, including the UK and Scandinavia, compared with southern Europe. Researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Copenhagen and Oxford spent more than 10 years delving into archaeology to investigate why. MS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms like muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking. They discovered that genes which increase the risk of MS entered into north-western Europe about 5,000 years ago via a massive migration of cattle herders called Yamnaya. The Yamnaya came from western Russia, Ukraine and Kazhakstan, and moved west into Europe, says one of four Nature journal papers published on the topic. The findings ""astounded us all"", said Dr William Barrie, paper author and expert in computational analysis of ancient DNA at University of Cambridge. At the time, the gene variants carried by the herding people were an advantage, helping to protect them against diseases in their sheep and cattle. Nowadays, however, with modern lifestyles, diets and better hygiene, these gene variants have taken on a different role. In the present day, these same traits mean a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as MS. The research project was a huge undertaking - genetic information was extracted from ancient human remains found in Europe and Western Asia, and compared with the genes of hundreds of thousands of people living in the UK today. In the process, a bank of DNA from 5,000 ancient humans, kept in museum collections across many countries, has now been set up to help future research. Prof Lars Fugger, paper author and MS doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, says the discovery helps ""demystify"" the disease. ""MS is not caused by mutations - it's driven by normal genes to protect us against pathogens,"" he explains. Vaccinations, antibiotics and higher standards of hygiene have changed the disease landscape completely - many diseases have disappeared and people are living decades longer. The researchers say modern immune systems may now be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like MS, where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it. Drugs currently used to treat MS target the body's immune system, but the downside is the risk of suppressing it so much that patients struggle to fight off infections. When treating it, we are up against evolutionary forces, Prof Fugger says. ""We need to find the sweet spot where there is a balance with the immune system, rather than wiping it out."" The team now plans to look for other diseases in ancient DNA and follow them back in time. Their research could reveal more about the origins of autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression. Another Nature paper uncovered even more clues about our genetic past - that the Yamnaya herders could also be responsible for north-western Europeans being taller than southern Europeans. And while northern Europeans carry more genetic risk for MS, southern Europeans are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, and eastern Europeans more likely to have Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. DNA from pre-historic hunter-gatherer people raises the risk of Alzheimer's, but ancient farmers' genes are linked to mood disorders, the research explains. It also discovered that humans' ability to digest milk and other dairy products and survive on a vegetable-heavy diet only emerged about 6,000 years ago. Before that, they were meat-eaters. The research compared DNA from thousands of ancient skeletons found in Eurasia to genetic samples from current-day Europeans.","['Archaeology', 'Genetics', 'DNA', 'Health', 'Europe', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1182E/production/_132262717_illustration_3_creditsayostudio.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12651/production/_132254357_gettyimages-1205541058.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A2FE/production/_132262714_ms_gene_migration_map_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C4C8/production/_132267305_976_skull.jpg']","['By Philippa Roxby', 'Health reporter']",Health,Health

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. Allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank, an inquest into his death heard. There is no evidence to suggest Mr Atkinson alerted staff to his allergy. The 23-year-old, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary an hour after ingesting peanuts. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen section of Dadyal's food safety management documents was blank. Mr Atkinson's flatmate, Luke Isley, previously gave evidence saying that the Newcastle University graduate had raised concerns about what he was eating as little as 30 seconds after beginning to eat his pizza, which sparked panic among his friends when he mentioned peanuts. By the time paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"", according to Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, who said he was ""profoundly unconscious"" by the time he was helped downstairs. He died in hospital less than an hour later. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts.

The Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce has compared 33 similarly wealthy nations in a survival league table. Wales ranks 32nd for stomach cancer, 31st for pancreatic and lung, 21st for liver and oesophageal and 12th for brain. The Welsh government said it is committed to improving cancer outcomes. The taskforce - a partnership of cancer charities including Tenovus Cancer Care - suggests Wales and the rest of the UK rank below most other countries for five-year survival rates. South Korea, Belgium, the United States, Australia and China were the countries that scored the highest. The six deadliest cancers are lung, liver, brain, oesophageal, pancreatic and stomach. More than 90,000 people are diagnosed with one of these six in the UK every year, and they account for 67,000 deaths - about half all cancer deaths. The chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, Judi Rhys, said people with these cancers had a ""shockingly low life expectancy"". Ms Rhys, who is also chairwoman of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce Wales subgroup, said: ""The actions we've repeatedly called for - targeted screening and monitoring those most at risk - would have a huge impact on survival. ""These latest statistics should be a strong reminder to Welsh government of the importance of prioritising and accelerating cancer survival initiatives."" She said ""exciting developments going on"" included a breath test that helps detect pancreatic cancer, which she wants more research done on. ""Similarly some of the tests that can be used for things like Barrett's oesophagus - which is the precursor often to throat cancer - we have some very simple, well tolerated tools that can be used which would be able to detect those cancers earlier. ""We're not rolling those out across Wales at the moment and that is a real concern to us."" About 15,400 people survive five years in the UK but, if rates were the same as the best performing countries, that could be as many as 23,775 people. The taskforce's report suggests delayed diagnosis and slow access to treatment could be to blame. Many patients were only diagnosed after an emergency admission to hospital or an urgent referral after their symptoms become severe. The Wales Cancer Network published a three-year cancer improvement plan last year, including plans for rapid diagnostic centres. The most recent NHS performance figures showed 56% of patients were treated within the target 62-days of cancer being suspected. The Welsh government said cancer is one of the six planning priorities for the NHS and it is committed to improving cancer outcomes. It said: ""The NHS Executive has introduced a national intervention that specifically targets improvement in service provision for gynaecological, urological, and lower gastrointestinal cancers - the cancers with the most challenging cancer performance.""","['Wales', 'Cancer', 'Welsh government', 'NHS Wales', 'Health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D8D3/production/_132270555_2e32df131590af55a7c84074e89e1b55c271355f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8AB3/production/_132270553_judirhystenovuscancercarenew.jpg']","['By Jenny Rees', 'BBC Wales health correspondent']",Health,Health

Millie-Rae, 11, has been home-educated by her mum Seana-lee in Merthyr Tydfil, since September. She is one of 5,330 children in Wales not being taught in school - the highest number on record. The Welsh government said it recognised the right of parents to teach their own children, but, in most cases, children were best served by attending school. Seana-lee originally took Millie-Rae out of school during the pandemic as she felt he daughter was not being provided with enough work. But within a few months of returning, she fell behind as she was struggling with the school environment, her mother said. When Millie-Rae began secondary school in September, she lasted just five days before refusing to go. Seana-lee said: ""Her confidence was slipping and she was starting not to go out with friends. She was getting tearful and stressed about not wanting to go back in. ""Her whole behaviour is totally different when she's in school."" Millie-Rae has recently been referred by a GP for ADHD investigations and struggled concentrating in a large, loud classroom. Seana-lee said: ""She lives in a daydream, which can be frustrating sometimes. She's very ditsy but also very clever. School didn't suit her as she needs that one-to-one attention. ""Home is a safe environment for her - she can fidget all she likes and as long as she's learning then I'm happy."" Seana-lee said she was nervous to homeschool Millie-Rae because her family were against it. ""You have to have thick skin to do this, it's not been easy,"" she said. ""Homeschooling has definitely brought her out of her shell and has given her the confidence I think she needed."" Millie-Rae said although she misses seeing her friends regularly, she goes to a weekly drama group to keep up her social life. ""Homeschooling is helping me to live and be happy. Finally, my mental health and my anxiety feels calmer,"" she said. Latest figures show that, from September 2022 to August 2023, 5,330 children were registered as being homeschooled in Wales, compared to 2,626 five years ago. There were fewer than 900 children identified as having their education at home a decade ago. Of the 22 councils in Wales, 17 have seen an increase with Carmarthenshire the highest - up from 457 two years before to 739. Figures may be inflated due to greater attempts from councils to find and record families who have opted against school. Victoria Williams, director of Smart Education Wales, a tuition centre based in Bridgend and Newport, said Covid was one of the main reasons behind the rise. ""Many are now suffering with mental health issues and social anxiety. They are struggling to fit back into society,"" she said. ""Children are also behind educationally and I think a lot of parents enjoyed the lockdowns and realised that they had the ability to educate their children themselves."" A Welsh government spokesman said about 1% of children in Wales were educated this way. ""The home educator's handbook provides advice to parents and carers who are home educating, or considering doing so,"" they added. ""We have also worked with every local authority to make sure that the most appropriate provision can be identified and put in place for each child.""","['Anxiety', 'Wales', 'Merthyr Tydfil', 'Mental health', 'Welsh government', 'Home education', 'Homeschooling']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D093/production/_132259335_mediaitem132086729.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/183D6/production/_132268299_homeschoolfamily.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/135B6/production/_132268297_millieraeschool.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E885/production/_132252595_mediaitem132252590.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/C175/production/_132252594_mediaitem132252593.jpg']","['By Eleri Griffiths', 'BBC News']",Health,Health

Patients who have leaky valves that are too wide, allowing blood to flow back to the heart, can now have a replacement one fitted. The aortic valves are made from animal tissue by a firm based in the village of Swillington, near Leeds. Leeds General Infirmary is one of only two hospitals in the UK to offer the procedure, which is done by using keyhole surgery. Consultant cardiologist Professor Dan Blackman described the procedure as ""hugely exciting"". He said the valve was placed into a metal frame which is then compressed. ""It's small enough to squeeze into a tube that will fit in the artery in the groin,"" he said. ""So once the valves inside that tube, we can pass it up from the artery in the groin up to the heart under X-ray guidance. ""When in position, essentially, we're pulling the tube back to release the frame and then the frame blinkers itself in position. ""The old valve is squashed behind the frame and the new valve takes over."" Patients receive sedation and painkillers but otherwise stay awake throughout the operation. The JenaValve Trilogy system has only been approved for use in the UK since September, with the first patients being treated at Leeds in October. Angela Ainsworth, from the company, said each valve was handmade at its Swillington factory. ""The tissue is cut to shape and then sutured or stitched into the valve and there's about 1,000 really small stitches that attaches the tissue to the valve,"" she said. ""It's so small that the process has to be done under a microscope."" One of the first people to undergo the surgery was 79-year-old Allan Kidd from Wakefield, who has had heart problems since 2019. He said he hoped the operation would make a difference to his health. ""It's been difficult really, because my breathing has been really bad,"" he said. ""I used to be fit and active and walked everywhere and did all that, but as the breathing got worse and worse, I couldn't even walk from my lunch to the kitchen without getting out of breath.""

The POD service was established in the region in 2015 and takes orders from patients online and over the phone, which are then passed to a GP to be signed-off before going to a pharmacy to be dispensed.It was estimated the service was saving about £6m per year, according to a council briefing in December 2018.People ordering from the POD were asked about their existing stock of medicine, helping to reduce waste and reduce stockpiling, the briefing added. It said patients also found the service convenient and reduced GP workloads.But health bosses are now axing the service, citing a “lack of value for money” as well as worsening performance and operational problems.They said GP surgeries using the service would go back to dealing directly with repeat prescriptions and be given access to a £200,000 funding pot to help with the change. A report into the decision has conceded that discontinuing the service could add to GPs’ workload.“We are clear that this is a time when primary care is already under significant pressure and the ICB is committed to supporting our GP practices to manage any potential issues,” it said.Patients are set to receive double prescriptions before it ends, so they have enough to cover the early weeks in April, in an effort to reduce the impact on GP services.

Trust documents show she ""should have been reviewed before discharge"". University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust said clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms. The trust described her condition as ""extraordinarily rare"" in a person of her age. The 21-year-old's mother said the hospital had ""let us down"". Ms Zoglie was admitted to hospital on 17 April with abdominal pain and doctors ordered a chest X-ray to be done. She was discharged and given medication typically used to treat stomach ulcers. Doctors had not realised her stomach was twisted. Ms Zoglie collapsed at home the next day and was taken to hospital in an ambulance, telling her mother she could not feel her legs. She had a heart attack and CPR was administered. Ms Zoglie was taken in for emergency surgery, but doctors discovered her stomach was effectively dead after the blood supply had been cut off by the twisting, and there was nothing they could do. On Monday, the coroner at her inquest concluded Ms Zoglie had died of natural causes, but highlighted inconsistencies between the recollection of the family and doctors, as well as discrepancies in the NHS trust's evidence. Internal documents from the trust seen by BBC Newsnight noted the ""patient should have been reviewed and examined by general surgery prior to discharge"". The trust's patient safety incident investigation report concluded there had been a ""missed opportunity for earlier diagnosis, had there been a surgical team review and a CT scan considered"". It also noted the ""significance"" of a large gastric bubble was ""not recognised"", and ""not all clinical reviews were documented"". A review by a senior doctor in the trust who was not involved in Ms Zoglie's treatment concluded her life ""would have been saved"" if surgery had been identified as ""clinically necessary"" when she first arrived at the hospital on 17 April. The review added her chest X-ray had shown an ""abnormally enlarged stomach"" which should have been followed up with a CT scan. Ms Zoglie's parents, Franklin and Antoinette Zoglie, said they did not believe the trust had been open and honest with them. Mrs Zoglie said: ""They've really let us down. We feel disappointed. They haven't learnt anything from the mistakes they did, so it's likely they can make the same mistakes over and over again."" The couple say they are looking to move out of their current home because it is ""not the same without her"". Mrs Zoglie said: ""When we're at home, we feel she's gone somewhere and she'll be back, but you wait and you realise she's not coming back."" A spokesperson for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said it offered its ""sincere condolences to Ms Zoglie's family for their terrible and shocking loss"". They said senior clinicians had used their ""best judgement"" to diagnose her symptoms but her condition was ""extraordinarily rare"". ""Such presentations are extremely challenging for staff trying to make the right decisions around tests and diagnostics, and the coroner agreed there was no clinical indication for further investigations at the time, concluding Ms Zoglie died from natural causes,"" the trust said. ""We understand just how devastating this has been for Ms Zoglie's family and friends. ""We have been in contact with them throughout, seeking their views on what our investigation should cover, sharing our findings with them, and offering to meet - that invitation remains open,"" they added.

Kate Brunner KC's report said schools did not get enough notice of closures and remote learning was a lottery. Rob Kelsall from National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said teachers had been working ""against a backdrop of a lack of support"". The government said it would digest the report before responding. Ms Brunner's report noted that teachers were given only one day's notice of school closures in March 2020 following consistent messaging that the island's facilities would not be closed. Although closures were a ""reasonable response"" there had been ""insufficient consideration of the impact"" at the time and children's views were not considered, the review found. It said schools were given insufficient notice and teachers had to ""work extremely hard"" to set up remote schooling and hubs for those who could not stay at home. Provision of remote learning was a ""postcode lottery at first"" but had greater consistency in subsequent lockdowns, it added. There was ""insufficient planning"" in relation to vulnerable children and ""weaknesses in the IT estate"" and island infrastructure that ""exacerbated inequalities"", but the ""schools and government mitigated effectively"", the report said. Ms Brunner made recommendations, including having a written plan for school closures and assessment of remote learning provision. The unions had been in a dispute with the department and the ""deeply fractured relationship"" was highlighted in a review by Beamans, which was commissioned shortly before the pandemic began and published in September 2020, Ms Brunner's report said. Mr Kelsall said: ""It is particularly good to see many of the concerns NAHT and school leaders raised at the time backed up here, from the government's lack of communication to risk assessments. ""School leaders did excellent work throughout Covid against a backdrop of a lack of support and planning from the then education department and the leadership in place at that time."" Responding to the report on Tuesday, Chief Minister Alfred Cannan said: ""This is an important report and it is crucial that we have a comprehensive understanding of its findings and recommendations."" He added that as it was over 3,600 pages it would take ""some time to digest"" and he appreciated the ""public's patience"" as that process began. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67917294,Scientists crack mystery of how MS gene spread,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts?",2024-01-10,"Why are diseases more common in some parts of Europe than others, and why are northern Europeans taller than their southern counterparts? An international team of scientists say they have unearthed the answer in the DNA of ancient teeth and bones. The genes which protected our ancestors from animal diseases now raise the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The researchers call their discovery ""a quantum leap"" in understanding the evolution of the disease. And they say it could change opinions on what causes MS, and have an impact on the way it is treated. There are about twice as many cases of multiple sclerosis per 100,000 people in north-western Europe, including the UK and Scandinavia, compared with southern Europe. Researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Copenhagen and Oxford spent more than 10 years delving into archaeology to investigate why. MS is a disease where the body's own immune cells attack the brain and spinal cord, leading to symptoms like muscle stiffness and problems walking and talking. They discovered that genes which increase the risk of MS entered into north-western Europe about 5,000 years ago via a massive migration of cattle herders called Yamnaya. The Yamnaya came from western Russia, Ukraine and Kazhakstan, and moved west into Europe, says one of four Nature journal papers published on the topic. The findings ""astounded us all"", said Dr William Barrie, paper author and expert in computational analysis of ancient DNA at University of Cambridge. At the time, the gene variants carried by the herding people were an advantage, helping to protect them against diseases in their sheep and cattle. Nowadays, however, with modern lifestyles, diets and better hygiene, these gene variants have taken on a different role. In the present day, these same traits mean a higher risk of developing certain diseases, such as MS. The research project was a huge undertaking - genetic information was extracted from ancient human remains found in Europe and Western Asia, and compared with the genes of hundreds of thousands of people living in the UK today. In the process, a bank of DNA from 5,000 ancient humans, kept in museum collections across many countries, has now been set up to help future research. Prof Lars Fugger, paper author and MS doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, says the discovery helps ""demystify"" the disease. ""MS is not caused by mutations - it's driven by normal genes to protect us against pathogens,"" he explains. Vaccinations, antibiotics and higher standards of hygiene have changed the disease landscape completely - many diseases have disappeared and people are living decades longer. The researchers say modern immune systems may now be more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like MS, where the immune system attacks the body rather than protecting it. Drugs currently used to treat MS target the body's immune system, but the downside is the risk of suppressing it so much that patients struggle to fight off infections. When treating it, we are up against evolutionary forces, Prof Fugger says. ""We need to find the sweet spot where there is a balance with the immune system, rather than wiping it out."" The team now plans to look for other diseases in ancient DNA and follow them back in time. Their research could reveal more about the origins of autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder and depression. Another Nature paper uncovered even more clues about our genetic past - that the Yamnaya herders could also be responsible for north-western Europeans being taller than southern Europeans. And while northern Europeans carry more genetic risk for MS, southern Europeans are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, and eastern Europeans more likely to have Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. DNA from pre-historic hunter-gatherer people raises the risk of Alzheimer's, but ancient farmers' genes are linked to mood disorders, the research explains. It also discovered that humans' ability to digest milk and other dairy products and survive on a vegetable-heavy diet only emerged about 6,000 years ago. Before that, they were meat-eaters. The research compared DNA from thousands of ancient skeletons found in Eurasia to genetic samples from current-day Europeans.","['Archaeology', 'Genetics', 'DNA', 'Health', 'Europe', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1182E/production/_132262717_illustration_3_creditsayostudio.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12651/production/_132254357_gettyimages-1205541058.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A2FE/production/_132262714_ms_gene_migration_map_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C4C8/production/_132267305_976_skull.jpg']","['By Philippa Roxby', 'Health reporter']",Health,Health

Inspectors concluded there was a ""negative culture"" and poor leadership at the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (EEAST) in 2020. This week, the service was removed from special measures by NHS England. Inspectors said the trust had expanded its safeguarding team and policies. ""We have seen a really significant reduction in cases of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment within the workplace,"" said trust chief executive Tom Abell, speaking to the BBC. ""We've [also] seen a really significant increase in the number of people speaking up around issues of bullying or sexual harassment in the workplace. ""That means we can now take much swifter, much more decisive action to tackle those issues at source, head on, and so it doesn't perpetuate and we can make sure that we're continuing to improve our culture."" In 2018, hundreds of EEAST employees reported bullying in a staff survey, and in 2020, a Freedom of Information Act request revealed 28 non-disclosure agreements had been issued since 2016. Thirteen cases of sexual misconduct by staff were also reported to police, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) later reported. However in July 2022, the CQC said the trust showed significant improvements on ""cultural issues"" and improvement in the way allegations were handled. On Tuesday, NHS England announced the trust was removed with ""immediate effect"" from the National Recovery Support Programme - previously known as special measures. ""Being caring isn't just around always being cuddly,"" added Mr Abell. ""Caring can also mean we have to have difficult conversations. We have had some difficult conversations within the organisation around tackling sexual harassment, tackling issues of racism. ""Ultimately that has got to lead to us delivering better care.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63642856,Black mould: How dangerous is it in the home and how can it be treated?,"Exposure to mould can cause respiratory illnesses, allergies and asthma, and can sometimes be fatal.",2024-01-10,"Exposure to mould can cause respiratory illnesses, allergies and asthma, and can sometimes be fatal. In 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died after prolonged exposure to mould in his home in Rochdale. Under new government proposals, dubbed ""Awaab's law"", social housing landlords in England could be forced to repair mouldy properties much more quickly. Mould - sometimes referred to using the American spelling mold - is a microscopic fungus that grows in damp places. Mould spores are found everywhere, and are released in their thousands into the atmosphere. Signs of mould at home include fuzzy black, white or green patches on the walls, and a damp and musty smell. People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma. Inhaling or touching the spores that mould releases into the air can cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and a skin rash. Mould can also trigger asthma attacks and cause coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. Each year, the NHS in England spends an estimated £1.4bn on treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing, according to building research body BRE. Those more at risk from mould include the elderly, children and babies, as well as people with existing respiratory illnesses and some skin problems. Condensation is the leading cause of mould in homes across the UK. It most commonly occurs in parts of the home where there are high moisture levels: bathrooms, kitchens, and around windows. When air cools, water vapour forms into water droplets as it comes into contact with surfaces in the home that are below a temperature known as the dew point. These surfaces can include uninsulated external walls or windows. If left untreated, the surface can become damp and create the conditions for mould to grow. Older and poorly insulated properties are more prone to this. Mould can also be caused by daily tasks which create excess moisture such as showering, cooking and drying washing indoors. Taking shorter showers and wiping down surfaces afterwards can help, as can improving ventilation, and opening kitchen windows or using an extractor fan when cooking. It is also important to check for leaky pipes or gutters which can make the problem worse. Private and social landlords have a responsibility to make sure homes are safe and in good repair. In private and social rental properties, it is the landlord's responsibility to fix a mould problem which is due to poor maintenance, according to the housing charity Shelter. If the mould is so bad that your home becomes unfit for habitation, then you could be classed as homeless and entitled to emergency accommodation. But landlords may not be responsible if there is evidence a tenant has not been ventilating the home correctly. In December 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died after prolonged exposure to mould in his home. He lived in a one-bedroom flat in Rochdale with his father Faisal Abdullah and Faisal's wife Aisha Amin. Mr Abdullah reported mould developing in the flat to his housing association, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), in 2017, but was told to paint over it. In June 2020, he instructed solicitors to issue a claim over the recurring mould, but any repairs could not be done until the case was settled. Awaab was taken to Rochdale Urgent Care Centre on 19 December that year with shortness of breath, and died a few days later after suffering respiratory and cardiac arrest. The government has announced plans to ensure social housing providers in England address hazards such as damp and mould more quickly. Social landlords would have to investigate issues within 14 days and begin fixing them within a further seven days. Emergency repairs would have to be made within 24 hours. Landlords who fail to comply could be taken to court and ordered to pay compensation. A consultation on the proposals closes on 5 March. After this, the government says it will bring Awaab's Law into force ""as soon as practically possible"". In Wales, the director of Housing and Regeneration asked social landlords to set out their response to the issues highlighted by Awaab's death. Four leading housing organisations in Scotland issued updated guidance about how the social housing sector should respond to damp and mould. In December 2022, the body representing Northern Ireland's housing associations said its members were ""reviewing their approaches to tackling mould and dampness"".","['Rochdale', 'Social housing', 'Housing', 'Health', 'Landlords', 'Manchester']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5D4C/production/_127648832_gettyimages-917892728.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13D7C/production/_132267218_mediaitem127647972.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6152/production/_127741942_7b4da376-f010-41ff-86f4-9f7562a0f106.jpg']","['By James Gregory & Tim Dodd', 'BBC News']",Health,Health

Mr Austin, 70, was admitted to hospital on 1 January and then to the intensive care unit for complications following surgery in December. He has faced criticism for not telling senior officials about it for days. He has since apologised for not ""ensuring the public was appropriately informed"". The lag in notifying the White House raised potential national security concerns and issues of transparency within the Biden administration. The defence secretary sits just below the president in the chain of command for the US military, and is one of the most important members of the president's Cabinet. The Pentagon confirmed Mr Austin remained hospitalised on Tuesday. At a press briefing on Tuesday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that President Biden was only informed that day about the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ""Nobody at the White House knew that Secretary Austin had prostate cancer until this morning,"" he said. While he emphasised the president's initial reaction was concern for the secretary's health, Mr Kirby acknowledged the communications were ""not optimal."" ""This is not the way it is supposed to go,"" Mr Kirby said. Mr Biden and Sec Austin have not spoken since their last interaction over the weekend, according to Mr Kirby. Mr Austin's deputy, Kathleen Hicks, was not informed of his hospital stay despite being asked to assume some of his responsibilities. Doctors for Mr Austin said a check up in December 2023 ""identified prostate cancer which required treatment"". Mr Austin underwent a ""minimally invasive surgical procedure"" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the nation's top military hospital, on 22 December to remove the cancer. He was under general anaesthesia for this procedure. He returned to hospital on 1 January 2024 after experiencing ""complications"", and an evaluation revealed a urinary tract infection. He was transferred to the intensive care unit the next day for further treatment, including for ""abdominal fluid collections impairing the function of his small intestines"". He ""never lost consciousness and never underwent general anaesthesia"" during this hospital stay, doctors said. Mr Austin's infection has cleared and ""he continues to make progress and we anticipate a full recovery although this can be a slow process"". Doctors emphasised that cancer was caught early and said that his ""prognosis is excellent"". A spokesman for Mr Austin did not provide an update for when he would be discharged, but said ""Secretary Austin continues to recover well and remains in good spirits"". At a Tuesday briefing, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder did not provide an explanation for why Mr Austin did not disclose his condition sooner. ""I don't have that specifically,"" he said, but noted that a prostate cancer diagnosis was ""deeply personal"". The Pentagon had said this failure occurred because a key staff member had the flu. Mr Ryder said notification procedures about the hospital stay were under review to ""make sure we're doing better next time"". White House chief of staff Jeff Zients on Tuesday directed members of the president's Cabinet to provide notice when they cannot perform their duties.","['United States', 'Prostate cancer']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3D0/production/_132263914_gettyimages-1857870634-1.jpg'],"['By Kayla Epstein in New York & Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House', 'BBC News']",Health,Health

The man was found unconscious in a manhole by other members of staff at Kettering General Hospital in Northamptonshire on 1 February 2022. He was rescued and treated for acute sulphate intoxication, causing ongoing memory loss and nerve damage. The hospital admitted it ""did not do enough"" to ensure the man's safety at work. In a hearing at Wellingborough Magistrates' Court, it pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2(1) of The Health & Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and was ordered to pay £4,286.15 in costs in addition to the six-figure fine. A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation found that the Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust failed to identify the manhole as a confined space, and thereafter, failed to properly risk assess the activity.

Mark Williams, from Abertillery, was diagnosed with MND 18 months ago after he began experiencing slurred speech and muscle twitching. MND is a debilitating condition that affects the brain and nerves, and there is currently no cure. His wife, Steph, says Mark now plans to raise money and awareness for the condition. Father-of-two Mark, 39, worked as a child therapist and Steph says talking was a big part of his job. He knew something was wrong when his speech started to change. ""The doctor's first thought it was acid reflux laryngitis and sent us away with medication for that,"" Steph said. ""But Mark knew deep down something wasn't right. But we put it down to stress. ""People kept asking if he'd had a drink because of his speech."" His physiotherapist noticed his reflexes had changed and advised Mark to go for an MRI scan, which he did privately to avoid a six-to-nine month NHS waiting list, and he was diagnosed with MND. Steph described the nine months between the initial symptoms and diagnosis as the hardest time. ""He was just thinking he had a terminal illness and Mark was adamant it was MND. He was so upset because of the impact it would have on us as a family rather than himself. ""Mark was the breadwinner, the planner, he was everything and all that was stripped away and that's a tough pill to swallow."" While the condition mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s, MND can be diagnosed in people of any age. ""When we finally got the diagnosis. Mark shook the consultant's hand and said thank you because he knew, and the wait was over."" Mark decided to begin fundraising for Doddie Aid which was set up in the name of former Scotland rugby international Doddie Weir, who died or MND at the age of 52. Mark has also been recording phrases with his own voice to use with speech-generating communication devices, known as voice banking. ""We didn't have time to be sad, because Mark was doing the fundraising and voice banking."" Doddie Aid has raised more than £4m for MND research in three years, and Mark completed 700 miles on his exercise bike last year for the foundation and hopes to do 200 miles this month. ""I feel like we've got to keep on with Doddie's work and taking on that baton,"" Steph said. After Mark's condition progressed, Steph finished working to become a full-time carer for her husband.

A total of 25 NHS contracts have been handed back across Sussex since 2020. Patient demand for NHS services in Sussex exceeds the capacity dentists are willing or able to provide, a recent report from NHS Sussex says. The government said it has invested £3bn each year to deliver dentistry. NHS Sussex, which is responsible for commissioning NHS dental services, will give an update report to West Sussex County Council later. The report found areas of deprivation, often with the highest levels of oral health needs, were particularly underserved by dentists. Dr Sami Butt, from S3 Dental in Haywards Heath, handed back his NHS contract in April last year after 20 years. He said it was a ""tough decision"" but ""the scheme was underfunded and it was a terrible contract"". He claimed: ""Over the years dentists have tried to make it work but unfortunately, post pandemic, it's just no longer feasible. ""The cost of living crisis has really hit home for a lot of businesses and with the funding the NHS is providing it's just simply not enough to be able to see patients on the NHS."" He added: ""It was so sad because some of these patients have been with us since they were children. I've seen them grow up. ""It's just heartbreaking for a lot of us as clinicians."" In 2022, NHS Sussex was one of the first Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) to take in responsibility for commissioning primary, secondary and dental services, alongside community pharmacy and optometry services. But the government manages NHS dental contracts and the funding associated with them. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: """"Last year 1.7m more adults and about 800,000 more children saw an NHS dentist compared with the previous year, but there is more to do, and the government is working on a dentistry plan with NHS England to make further improvements. ""We invest more than £3bn each year to deliver NHS dentistry, and we have already introduced reforms designed to incentivise practices to deliver more dental care.""

The new Jenny Lind Paediatrics Theatre Complex at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital includes two theatres and a recovery unit. The hospital said child patients will now be treated at the dedicated department instead of general theatres. Chief executive Nick Hulme described it as a ""major development for paediatrics"" at the hospital. He said the unit ""supports our ambition to be a leading provider of specialist paediatric care in the east"". Work began to build the new sustainable unit in 2021. Surgical procedures, including orthopaedic operations, will be carried out five days a week initially in the new department. First patients, Ronnie Cooper and Henriette Johnson, helped to open the complex on Tuesday by holding the ribbon for the hospital's clinical lead Caroline Banson to cut. She said: ""I am really proud of the unit, which has been created very much with our younger patients at the heart of our decision-making. ""It also provides a much better working space for our teams."" A £160,000 grant from the N&N Hospitals Charity paid for artworks by local artist Toby Rampton and storyteller Amanda Smith, as well as audio-visual equipment in the hospital for improved digital documentation, training, education and conferencing. The hospital said the new department would also aim to use cylinders of gas and air (nitrous oxide) to avoid leaks and waste of a potent greenhouse gas, known to be associated with piped nitrous oxide.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67935037,Covid inquiry postpones vaccine investigation,"The Covid inquiry will not start hearing evidence about the development of vaccines and other drugs this summer, as originally planned.",2024-01-10,"The Covid inquiry will not start hearing evidence about the development of vaccines and other drugs this summer, as originally planned. Witness hearings will be postponed until a later date, likely to be after the next general election. Baroness Hallett, who is chairing the inquiry, recognised the decision would be ""disappointing for some"". But she said more time was needed to prepare for a separate investigation into the impact of Covid on the NHS. ""I want to ensure our hearings in 2024 are as effective as possible and I recognise the increasing pressure on organisations to respond to requests and provide information to the inquiry,"" she added. ""I remain committed to not allowing the inquiry hearings to run beyond my original aim of summer 2026."" The Covid-19 public inquiry has been split into a number of sections - known as modules - each covering different topics. The first phase, which started taking evidence in June 2023, looked at planning for a pandemic. Its findings and recommendations are expected to be published this summer. A second phase, looking at the major political decisions taken after Covid emerged, started hearings in London in October 2023, and will now travel to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to take evidence. The module investigating vaccines and therapeutics was originally expected to start in the summer of 2024, but that has now been postponed. Instead, public hearings will restart in September 2024 looking at the impact of the pandemic on the NHS and healthcare, as originally planned. The investigation into vaccines was meant to look in detail at the rollout of jabs across the UK, including the setting up of the UK vaccines taskforce and the role of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. It will also cover concerns around vaccine safety, including any suggested link between the jabs and heart issues, and whether reforms are needed to the scheme which is meant to pay out if an individual's health is damaged after taking the jabs. No timing has been given for the postponed hearings, with further details promised ""in the next few weeks"". It is thought the decision is likely to push that part of the inquiry until after the next general election, which has to take place before 28 January 2025. The inquiry is also still expected to question the current cabinet secretary, Simon Case, in a special hearing later this spring. Mr Case, who has recently returned as head of the civil service after two months of sick leave, was not able to give evidence last autumn when the second phase of the inquiry looked at the political decisions made during the pandemic. In WhatsApp exchanges with other Downing Street officials, and later read out at the inquiry, he was often critical of ministers. In one message he accused officials, including former health secretary Matt Hancock and then-education secretary Gavin Williamson, of being ""weak"". In another, he described being ""at the end of my tether"" over decisions being made by Boris Johnson and said the former prime minister was ""unable to lead"".","['Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus public inquiry', 'Coronavirus vaccines']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/318E/production/_132268621_daf21caa84cdcdd43fe4c3755fcae2215a0f2385.jpg'],"['By Jim Reed', 'Health reporter']",Health,Health
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67860456,All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.",2024-01-10,"As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique. In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out. The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant. It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180: £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more. But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam. Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman. So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others. But finding the victims has proved more tricky. ""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained. The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers. ""Ten minutes after I'd clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me. The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate. They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived. ""I'm a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me. Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get. He's shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"". The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said. When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax. By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund. ""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me. ""I'm a poor labourer, I'd lost a month's pay and I didn't want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers' gang. According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education. Mangesh says it didn't strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller's WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine. ""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks. The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety. However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"". ""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat."" But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"". As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds. ""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more."" But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people. ""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says. The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh. While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with. On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily. She's now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he's pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST. ""I told her I'm broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won't be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me. I ask him if he still trusts the scammers. ""I really don't know what to do now. I've lost an entire month's pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me."" He's angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call. ""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment. I do backbreaking work the whole day for 500 rupees. I know I made a huge mistake. But what they did with me is so wrong."" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Joy Ebanks, 59, died from oxycodone toxicity in May last year. Sean Cummings, the assistant coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, said there was ""no evidence"" to suggest a plan was formed by Kirby Road Surgery in Dunstable to reduce the dosages. The surgery said it would put together an action plan. In his prevention of future deaths report, Dr Cummings said Mrs Ebanks was taking oxycodone and pregabalin as pain treatment and her primary cause of death was ""oxycodone toxicity enhanced by pregabalin intake"". Oxycodone is an opioid painkiller used to treat severe pain. Long-term use is associated with physical and mental health issues, heart conditions and accidental overdoses. Mrs Ebanks suffered from fibromyalgia, arthritis, agoraphobia and was diagnosed with depression, Dr Cummings said. She was prescribed venlafaxine and quetiapine - both used to treat mental health conditions - and took cannabis. The patient lived alone, had not engaged with support and had ""been self-neglecting"", the report added. She was found unresponsive by her care worker on 24 May 2023 and was pronounced dead at the scene. Dr Cummings said Mrs Ebanks had been prescribed ""opiates since at least 2009"". Medication reviews were largely done by telephone because of her agoraphobia and dislike of people coming to her home, he wrote. ""There was evidence of poor communications between the agencies providing her with different aspects of her care,"" he said. ""There was no evidence of any attempt to review the prescriptions of two dependency forming drugs with a view to reducing the dose over time. The opioid prescription was high."" The report said there was ""a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken"". The surgery said it was saddened by her death and added: ""We are currently considering the contents of his report and will reply with an action plan to address the matters raised."" A copy of the report was also sent to the East London NHS Foundation Trust which ""may find it useful or of interest"", Dr Cummings said. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

The Chelsea midfielder told BBC Sport about one description of her performance after a game, which said: ""'Fran played really well, what a game, but she looked big today'"". ""I had countless comments about having big thighs and how strong my legs look,"" Daisy, 21, tells BBC Newsbeat. ""When you're that young, you do start to worry. I thought I don't want to wear leggings because then everyone can see the shape of my legs."" For 21-year-old Charlotte, comments about her body didn't put her off playing football, ""but it definitely made me a lot more conscious of what I ate"". ""It's quite a common thing around girls' football. It's definitely not a shock to hear what she [Fran] said."" Daisy, who plays for Stourbridge FC in Birmingham, feels there has always been a perception that a female footballer needs to look a certain way. ""But what they look like does not affect their ability to be a good footballer."" She thinks there's a deeper issue around the comparison of males and females in sport. ""I went to a school where girls weren't allowed to play football. It was specifically the boys do football, the girls do netball,"" she says. Charlotte, who played for Birmingham City's development teams throughout her childhood, thinks there's a perception about ""an ideal type of athlete"". ""And how they look, but obviously women's bodies are very different. ""I don't think it's ever going to be the same as that. There's always different types, shapes and sizes in women's football."" As Chelsea's record goal-scorer, Kirby explains she now has ""no fear"" raising these issues because she's an experienced international. ""I have been around long enough to suffer my own abuse growing up and seeing it on social media - you don't become accustomed to it, though, and there's still things you read."" She has received messages from other players raising concerns for their team-mates, who they believe are struggling with body image issues. And while ""there is not one answer"" on how to deal with it as ""everyone is different"", she does feel support is important. Daisy feels having ""a support circle"" can helpful. ""There are a lot of people who struggle in football, a lot of people who say there's not enough support."" ""The way that will get better is by people talking and speaking up and saying how the game could be improved, how the support could be improved."" Charlotte says turning to those closest to you can be an option. ""For months when I was struggling with it, I don't think I spoke to coaches for about three or four months into the season. ""Your coach is going to care when you come up to them and speak to them about it,"" Charlotte says. ""Speak to people, especially friends, they're all going to be there for you.""

The poster featured singer FKA twigs wearing a denim shirt that was drawn halfway around her body, showing the side of her buttocks and half of one breast. Above her, the text read: ""Calvins or nothing"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found the ad was likely to cause serious offence by objectifying women. The regulator ruled the ""image's composition placed viewers' focus on the model's body rather than on the clothing being advertised"". It also noted by focusing on FKA twigs' ""physical features"", it had ""presented her as a stereotypical sexual object"". ""We therefore concluded the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence,"" it said. Defending its advert, Calvin Klein said it had been similar to those it had been releasing in the UK for many years. The fashion brand described the Two Weeks hitmaker as a ""confident and empowered woman"", and said she had collaborated with the company to produce the image and had approved it before publication. It added that all ""conventionally sensitive"" body areas were fully covered and FKA twigs was in a natural and neutral position. Two people had complained that the images were ""overly sexualised"", offensive and irresponsible because they objectified women and were inappropriately displayed. These complaints were also directed towards two posters from the same campaign which featured model Kendall Jenner. But the ASA found these posters did not focus on Kendall's body ""in a manner that portrayed her as a sexual object"" and the level of nudity was not beyond that which people would expect for a lingerie advert.
