https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67942983,"Israel officials support Gaza destruction, court hears","Israel's plan to ""destroy"" Gaza comes from ""the highest level of state"", the UN's top court has heard.",2024-01-11,"Israel's plan to ""destroy"" Gaza comes from ""the highest level of state"", the UN's top court has heard. The claims were made by South African lawyers as it presented its case accusing Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice. South Africa also called on the court to order Israel to cease military operations in Gaza. Israel - which will present its defence on Friday - has vehemently rejected the accusations as ""baseless"". The court will deliver only an opinion on the genocide allegation, although it is being closely watched. Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, a lawyer for the High Court of South Africa, told the ICJ Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which this military attack is being conducted"". ""The intent to destroy Gaza has been nurtured at the highest level of state,"" he said. ""Every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people,"" Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court. ""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". Israel will offer its defence on Friday, but has previously said its actions in the Gaza Strip are justified because it is responding to Hamas's deadly attacks on 7 October. But speaking in court on Thursday, South Africa's Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said that no attack ""can provide justification for or defend breaches of the [Genocide] Convention"". Israel is a signatory to the Genocide Convention of 1948, which defines genocide and commits states to prevent it. On Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""the hypocrisy of South Africa screams to the heavens"" - criticising the country for failing to respond to atrocities in Syria and Yemen committed by ""partners of Hamas"". ""Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide,"" he added. ""Israel is fighting murderous terrorists who carried out crimes against humanity."" The US, meanwhile, said that it saw no justification for South Africa's allegation that Israel has committed genocide. ""They are defending themselves against a still viable threat,"" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby. The ICJ is the United Nation's highest court, based in The Hague in the Netherlands. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. In 2022, the court ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine, an order that was ignored. Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. There were angry scenes outside the ICJ's building, known as the Peace Palace, as Dutch police struggled to keep groups of Palestinian and Israeli supporters apart. Hundreds of people waving Palestinian flags gathered outside the ICJ, calling for a ceasefire. Israeli supporters set up a screen showing images of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza. Red and white police tape has been placed outside the ICJ in an attempt to bring some semblance of order to the chaotic scenes outside. It was in contrast to the formality inside the court, where the Israeli delegation is listening to South Africa's lawyers accuse the country's forces of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel's delegation is expected to highlight its right to self-defence under international law - this week, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had no intention of permanently displacing the people of Gaza, or occupying the territory. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes such as genocide, but its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. On Wednesday, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said: ""Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ."" Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the accusations ""atrocious and preposterous"". ""We will be in the International Court of Justice and we will present proudly our case of using self-defence… under humanitarian law,"" he said. He added that the Israeli army was ""doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties"". The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign - but a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza, and its governing African National Congress has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. In Gaza, more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since the war began in the aftermath of Hamas's 7 October attacks on southern Israel. In those attacks some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.","['South Africa', 'International Court of Justice', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3B49/production/_132277151_gettyimages-1916272669.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16FE1/production/_132277149_gettyimages-1916423177.jpg']","['Anna Holligan', 'Hague correspondent', 'Oliver Slow']",Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675,Gaza Strip in maps: How life has changed in three months,Almost two million people in Gaza - more than 85% of the population - are reported to have fled their homes in the three months since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas's deadly attacks of 7 October.,2024-01-11,"Almost two million people in Gaza - more than 85% of the population - are reported to have fled their homes in the three months since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas's deadly attacks of 7 October. The Strip has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 and Israel says it is trying to destroy the military and governing capabilities of the Islamist group, which is committed to the destruction of Israel. Gaza - a densely populated enclave 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt at its borders - has ""simply become uninhabitable"", according to a senior United Nations official. Israel warned civilians to evacuate the area of Gaza north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, ahead of its invasion. The evacuation area included Gaza City - which was the most densely populated area of the Gaza Strip. The Erez border crossing into Israel in the north is closed, so those living in the evacuation zone had no choice but to head towards the southern districts. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are now focusing its operations on southern Gaza and have told Palestinians that even Khan Younis - the largest urban area in the south - is not safe and they should move south, or further west to a so-called ""safe area"" at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of mainly agricultural land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border. Fighting in Khan Younis has pushed tens of thousands of people to flee to the southern district of Rafah, the UN said. According to the UN, just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before Israel warned Palestinians to leave northern Gaza. Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose ""place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War"". The children of Palestinian refugees are also able to apply for refugee status. More than 500,000 of those refugees were already in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Following Israel's warnings, the number of displaced people has risen rapidly and 1.9 million have fled their homes since 7 October, the UN says. On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London - but that figure was more than 9,000 in Gaza City, the most heavily populated area. As Gazans have fled south, the population density is now more than 12,000 people per square kilometre in Rafah, the UN says. The UN warns that overcrowding has become a major concern in its emergency shelters in central and southern Gaza, with some housing at four times its capacity. Many of these emergency shelters are schools and in some there are dozens of people living in a single classroom. Other families are living in tents or makeshift shelters in compounds or on waste ground in open spaces. Israel has already launched hundreds of airstrikes across Gaza and says it has used more than 10,000 bombs and missiles, causing extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure. Gazan officials say more than 50% of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed, left uninhabitable or damaged since the start of the conflict. They say more than 500,000 people will have no homes to return to, and many more will be not be able to return immediately after the conflict because of damage to surrounding infrastructure. The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which urban areas have sustained concentrated damage since the start of the conflict. They say more than 130,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have suffered damage. North Gaza and Gaza City have borne the brunt of this, with at least 70% of buildings in the two northern regions believed to have been damaged, but their analysis now suggests up to 50% of buildings in Khan Younis have also been damaged. Even healthcare facilities have been left unable to function as a result of bomb damage or lack of fuel. The UN says hospital capacity in the enclave has more than halved from 3,500 beds before 7 October to about 1,000 now - and ""hardly any"" in the north. More than 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed during the Hamas attacks on 7 October. More than 23,000 Palestinians - including about 8,000 children - have been killed in Israeli airstrikes and operations since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. It is difficult for the BBC to verify exact numbers, but the UN's World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has no reason to believe the figures are inaccurate. The airstrikes were accompanied by a ""complete siege"" of Gaza by Israel, with electricity, food and fuel supplies cut, followed by military action on the ground. The IDF began its ground operations by moving into Gaza from the north-west along the coast and into the north east near Beit Hanoun. A few days later Israeli forces cut across the middle of the territory to the south of Gaza City. Armoured bulldozers created routes for tanks and troops, as the Israeli forces tried to clear the area of Hamas fighters based in northern Gaza. Having cut Gaza in two, the Israelis pushed further into Gaza City, where they faced resistance from Hamas. While there are still clashes in some areas, analysts from the Institute for the Study of War say Israeli forces have started to secure parts of northern Gaza. The image below, released by the IDF, shows tanks and armoured bulldozers on the beach near Gaza City. A photo of the same beach from last summer shows people making the most of a hot day in Gaza, families splashing in the sea or sitting on fanning out along the beach. Even before the current conflict, about 80% of the population of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid, and although Israel has been allowing some aid in from Egypt, aid agencies said it was nowhere near enough. The World Food Programme says half of Gaza's population is starving and 90% of the population regularly go without food for a whole day. A seven-day ceasefire at the end of November allowed agencies to deliver an average of 170 trucks and 110,000 litres of fuel a day, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says. Aid trucks are still crossing into Gaza, but the WHO has warned that delivering that aid ""continues to face near insurmountable challenges"" as the area endures intense bombardment, movement restrictions, interrupted communications and fuel shortages.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67932725,US and UK hint at military action after largest Houthi attack in Red Sea,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping.",2024-01-11,"The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels, after they repelled the largest attack yet on Red Sea shipping. Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night. The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday demanding an immediate end to the Houthi attacks. The text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. The Houthis reacted scornfully to it. Their spokesman Mohammed Ali al-Houthi called the resolution a ""political game"".  They claim to be targeting Israeli-linked vessels, in protest at Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. The UN resolution demanded ""that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks, which impede global commerce and undermine navigational rights and freedoms as well as regional peace and security"". Eleven nations voted for it, but Russia, China, Mozambique and Algeria abstained. Earlier, the US and several allies warned of ""consequences"" for the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Asked about potential strikes in Yemen, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Watch this space."" The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead. The Houthis said they targeted a US ship on Tuesday providing support to Israel. It was the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November. The US military said Iranian-designed one-way attack drones, anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen at around 21:15 local time (18:15 GMT). Eighteen drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile were shot down by F/A-18 warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower, which is deployed in the Red Sea, and by four destroyers, the USS Gravely, USS Laboon, USS Mason and HMS Diamond. HMS Diamond shot down seven of the Houthi drones using its guns and Sea Viper missiles, each costing more than £1m ($1.3m), a defence source said. No injuries or damage were reported. Later, Houthi military spokesman Yahya al-Sarea confirmed its forces had carried out an operation involving ""a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones"". ""It targeted a US ship that was providing support for the Zionist entity [Israel],"" he said. ""The operation came as an initial response to the treacherous assault on our naval forces by the US enemy forces,"" he added, referring to the sinking of three Houthi speed boats and killing of their crews by US Navy helicopters during an attempted attack on a container ship on 31 December. He added that the rebels would ""not hesitate to adequately deal with all hostile threats as part of the legitimate right to defend our country, people and nation"". Mr Sarea also reiterated that the Houthis would continue to ""prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestine from navigating in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the [Israeli] aggression [on Gaza] has come to an end and the blockade has been lifted"". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""very concerned"" because of the risks the situation posed to global trade, the environment and lives, as well as the ""risk of the escalation of the broader conflict in the Middle East"". Mr Shapps warned on Wednesday that the UK and its allies had ""previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and if continued the Houthis will bear the consequences"". ""We will take the action needed to protect innocent lives and the global economy,"" he added. Later, the defence secretary said in a TV interview that Iran was ""behind so much of the bad things happening in the region"" and warned the Islamic Republic and the Houthis that there would be ""consequences"" if the attacks on shipping did not stop. Asked if there could be Western military action against Houthi targets in Yemen, or even targets inside Iran, he replied: ""I can't go into details but can say the joint statement we issued set out a very clear path that if this doesn't stop then action will be taken. So, I'm afraid the simplest thing to say [is] 'watch this space'."" He was referring to a statement put out a week ago by the UK, US, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore, who launched ""Operation Prosperity Guardian"" last month to protect Red Sea shipping. They said the attacks posed ""a direct threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways"". It may not have had the bravado of Mr Shapps' ""watch this space"" warning, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also clear in his condemnation of the incident. Speaking to reporters at an airport in Bahrain during a Middle East tour, he was pressed by BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher about whether it was time that talk of consequences turned to US action. Mr Blinken responded that he did not want to ""telegraph"" a US military move, but that he had spent the past four days in the region warning the Houthis to cease their aggression. They have not only refused, but after this latest strike have claimed they are specifically targeting US ships. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. The Houthis say they have been targeting Israeli-owned or Israel-bound vessels to show their support for the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthis began as a movement that championed Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority. In 2014, they took control of the capital, Sanaa, and seized large parts of western Yemen the following year, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in support of the international-recognised Yemeni government. The ensuing war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and left 21 million others in need of humanitarian assistance. Saudi Arabia and the US have accused Iran of smuggling weapons, including drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, to the Houthis in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.","['Royal Navy', 'Yemen', 'Grant Shapps', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Shipping industry', 'United States', 'Houthis', 'Global trade']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/86A2/production/_132266443_redsea.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AF38/production/_132265844_4d44a6007b89d7deb75cbca44da7cf0d478c148c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/89B8/production/_132065253_thumbnail_bab_al_mandab_strait_2x640-nc.png']",['David Gritten'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war

Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who has been working at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said the fighting meant there has been ""a real decrease"" in the number of staff able to work at the facility over the past two weeks. At the same time, she said some 600 to 700 patients were still being treated inside the hospital daily, and that hundreds of displaced people were sheltering there or in the immediate vicinity. ""Without any functioning or sufficient healthcare staff, it will be an unmitigated disaster for those people living in Middle Gaza,"" another member of the team, surgeon Nick Maynard, told the BBC. When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: ""The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there."" Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them. On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been ""forced to withdraw and cease activities"" as a result of what they called ""increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital"". The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had ""received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave"". He stated that al-Aqsa was ""the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"". ""Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage,"" he warned. Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday. ""I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)."" He added: ""We were told we had to leave."" Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves. The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was ""not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question"". Another doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days. ""It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away,"" he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard. Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details. And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead. The IDF said in a statement on Thursday that ""a review was conducted based on the details provided to the IDF which shows that no strike was carried out in the described area"". ""The IDF is committed to international law and takes all feasible measures in order to mitigate civilian harm,"" it added. The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing. Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a ""dangerous combat zone"" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital. The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves. Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone. The IDF said ""no specific evacuation notice had been given to"" al-Aqsa. Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed. Dr Smith said: ""Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital. ""Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday."" He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital. ""There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital."" Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital. The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed ""horrific"" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital. ""We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash,"" Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. ""We just had to use alcohol gel before operating."" ""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean. ""Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching,"" he added. Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: ""There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold. ""Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity."" She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief. ""I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said. ""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor."" Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries. ""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged."" The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that ""intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea"" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas. ""The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza,"" it warned. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them. The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","['Hamas', 'Palestinian territories', 'Israel', 'Israel-Gaza war']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147FE/production/_132266938_baby.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8134/production/_132267033_gaza_basic_al_aqsa_hospital-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0C04/production/_132267030_notes2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3A76/production/_132266941_blood2.jpg']",['Alys Davies'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war

Photos from Ukraine's State Emergency Service showed the hotel heavily damaged and firefighters at the scene. Governor Oleh Synehubov said the injured included Turkish journalists. Two S-300 missiles struck at about 22:30 (20:30 GMT), he said. Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukrainian cities in the past two weeks. Ukrainian officials say dozens of civilians have died in those attacks from drones and missiles. Kharkiv, just 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border, has suffered extensive damage from Russian air strikes since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In the latest strike, nine injured were taken to hospital, including a 35-year-old man in a serious condition, the governor said on the Telegram messaging service. The city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, quoted by Ukraine's Unian news agency, said ""there were no military at all"" in the hotel at the time, but 30 civilians were there. It is in the city's central Kyiv district. He said several homes and cars nearby were also damaged. The Russian city of Belgorod, 74km north of Kharkiv, was hit by Ukrainian missiles and drones on 30 December which Russian officials say killed 25 civilians. Russia has started moving hundreds of Belgorod children to holiday camps further away from Ukraine for three-week stays. A camp in Voronezh region received 93 on Wednesday and later 280 arrived in Kaluga region, state TV reported, adding that teachers would join them there. President Volodymyr Zelensky, on a visit to Lithuania on Wednesday, urged Western allies to provide more air defence weapons. The Baltic nation is among the staunchest allies of Ukraine in bolstering Kyiv's resistance to the Russian forces. ""Air defence systems are what we lack the most. The fight against drones. I am happy that we have agreements with Lithuania and many other partners,"" he said in Vilnius. Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Estonia, are ex-Soviet states now in the Nato alliance. In terms of GDP, Lithuania is the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy reports. The US contribution to Ukraine's defence is, however, by far the largest. Mr Zelensky, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine, said Vladimir Putin ""will not calm down until he destroys Ukraine"". ""He wants to fully occupy us. And sometimes our partners' doubts over financial and military assistance to Ukraine, quick reaction, gives courage and strength to the Russian Federation."" He said the Russian leader ""won't finish this [war], until we all finish him together"" and warned that the Baltic states and Moldova ""may be next"". In recent days, the Ukrainian leader has held intensive talks with Western allies aimed at maintaining vital arms deliveries. Kyiv's counter-offensive late last year made little progress, and some in the West have questioned Kyiv's strategy, fuelling concern about the cost of the war. With Russia now committed to much higher military expenditure, Nato countries are struggling to boost production of artillery shells and other heavy weapons. An EU aid package worth €50bn (£43bn: $55bn) for Ukraine is stuck because of a Hungarian veto, while the divided US Congress has stalled over a new tranche of military aid. After a video conference with the Ukrainian government on Wednesday, Nato said it had plans to provide ""billions of euros of further capabilities"" to Ukraine this year. ""Nato strongly condemns Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians, including with weapons from North Korea and Iran,"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said.","['Russia', 'Nato', 'Ukraine', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'War in Ukraine', 'Kyiv']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10C81/production/_132273786_mediaitem132273785.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/13F50/production/_131944718_military_aid-nc.png']",['Laurence Peter'],War in Ukraine,N/A
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67949900,Ukraine war: MPs reject bid to crack down on draft dodgers,Ukraine's parliament has refused to consider a conscription bill that proposes a crackdown on draft dodgers.,2024-01-11,"Ukraine's parliament has refused to consider a conscription bill that proposes a crackdown on draft dodgers. MPs have criticised certain punishment measures included in the bill as unconstitutional. Some have also suggested reducing the length of military service proposed in the bill from 36 to 18 months. The bill was drafted in a bid to conscript more people, as Kyiv faces problems on the battlefield after nearly two years of war with Russia. It also included plans to lower the age at which men can be conscripted into the armed forces from 27 to 25. Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 450,000-500,000 extra soldiers were needed to fight Russia's invasion. But some clauses in the bill have caused outrage, such as limiting draft dodgers' rights to own property and freely use their personal money. The bill would also allow Ukrainians to be summoned electronically to join the armed forces. At the start of the war, tens of thousands of men volunteered to fight but almost two years on it is getting harder to convince anyone to join up. In December, Ukrainians living abroad were told they could be asked to report for military service. Defence Minister Rustem Umerov described this as an invitation and the ministry later clarified that it did not imply any sanctions against those who refused to come back. Mr Zelensky said achieving the increased number of troops was a ""sensitive"" and costly issue. This all comes as Kyiv's recent counter-offensive seems to have stalled and provisions of military aid have also taken a knock in recent months. US Republicans blocked a $61bn (€55bn: £48bn) military package and Hungary stopped an EU financial deal worth €50bn ($55bn: £43bn). White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday that negotiations over further US assistance had ""ground to a halt"" as the government continues to negotiate its budget. Mr Zelensky is currently on a tour of the Baltic states - and is currently in Latvia - to bolster further support including urging Western allies to provide more air defence weapons. Speaking earlier in Tallinn, Estonia, he warned about the dangers of Western hesitation. He said: ""Sometimes the insecurity of partners regarding financial and military aid to Ukraine only increases Russia's courage and strength."" His remarks came as a new US report warned that more than $1bn (£785m) worth of US military aid given to Ukraine since February 2022 was not properly tracked. The findings by the Pentagon's inspector general said US officials in Washington DC and Europe had failed to properly account for thousands of weapons, including stringer launchers and air defence missiles. It raises concerns that some of the $1.69bn in military aid supplied to Ukraine could have been misappropriated. But in a letter responding to the report, Col Garrett W Trott of the US military's European Command, emphasised that the report found ""no evidence of unauthorised or illicit transfer of EEUM [Enhanced End Use Monitoring] defence articles provided to Ukraine"". And the report itself conceded that it was ""beyond the scope"" of its inquiry to determine whether any arms had been misappropriated.","['Russia', 'Ukraine', 'War in Ukraine']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AB20/production/_132280834_4428beb8cc16904bc800f743385b4aa43708cf7b.jpg'],"['Abdujalil Abdurasulov', 'Megan Fisher']",War in Ukraine,N/A

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67939708,UK government plans further nuclear power expansion,"The government is exploring plans to build a new large-scale nuclear plant, despite concerns about delays to existing projects.",2024-01-11,"The government is exploring plans to build a new large-scale nuclear plant, despite concerns about delays to existing projects. Ministers say the project would be the biggest expansion of the sector in 70 years, reducing reliance on overseas supply. The new plant would quadruple energy supplies by 2050, they say. But concerns have been raised, with existing nuclear projects already behind schedule and over-budget. The government's Civil Nuclear Roadmap is intended to bolster the UK's energy independence by exploring a new site for another nuclear power station of the size and scale of the £30bn plants under construction at Hinkley Point in Somerset and committed to Sizewell in Suffolk. Industry sources have told the BBC the leading candidates would include Wylfa on Anglesey or Moorside in Cumbria. Thursday's announcement also pledged £300m to produce nuclear reactor fuel in the UK, currently only commercially produced in Russia, which it said would lower bills and improve energy security. But recent nuclear projects have been beset by delays, cost overruns and in the case of Sizewell C, continuing local opposition. In total, the government has now earmarked more than £1bn for the Sizewell C project, building on its original £700m stake as part of its plan to rapidly expand the UK's nuclear energy sector. The Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology (REA) said all clean energy needed fast-tracking. Nuclear power currently provides around 15% of the UK's electricity but many of the country's ageing reactors are due to be decommissioned over the next decade. Progress can be slow - to get from planning to ""power on"" can take nearly 20 years. Consultations for Sizewell took 10 years alone. The majority of construction there is yet to start and strong local opposition to the project remains. The government will hope to address such problems by streamlining the development of new power stations. By introducing smarter regulation it anticipates it will be able to deliver new nuclear power plants faster. Jack Abbott, an expert in the clean energy sector, who is also a Labour candidate in the neighbouring constituency to Sizewell, said the government had been ""dragging their feet"" on nuclear for too long. ""Fourteen years and not one new site opened, despite inheriting 10 approved sites from the last Labour government. Labour supports expanding the UK's nuclear power fleet, which must form a critical part of our future energy mix,"" Mr Abbott said. The REA is also sceptical. It said the government had been exploring a new private-led nuclear plant for years. However, the association did commend the government on its plans to commit £300m to produce reactor fuel in the UK. Policy director Frank Gordon added: ""We need to accelerate the deployment of all clean energy sources, especially renewable power from diverse sources, plus supporting the roll-out of the much-needed clean technologies, energy storage working at all scales and duration."" But the government said the plans would also support thousands of jobs, as well as ""pushing Putin out of the global market"" to provide a quarter of the UK's electricity needs. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said nuclear was the ""perfect antidote to the energy challenges facing Britain"". Of the two consultations being published on Thursday one will focus on ""a new approach"" to siting future nuclear power stations, empowering developers to find suitable locations. The other will lead on encouraging private investment. ""Community engagement will remain critical to any decisions, alongside maintaining robust criteria such as nearby population densities,"" the government said. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, welcomed the publication of the roadmap and streamlined regulation but said the UK needed to develop both large and small nuclear generation ""at scale and at pace"".","['Net zero', 'Renewable energy', 'Sizewell', 'Nuclear power']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17347/production/_132274059_7c0eceef1785475270286dde6b745a16a2d907ca.jpg'],"['Jemma Dempsey', 'Sam Gruet']",Climate,Climate Change
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67937595,Mozambique storms: How to cyclone-proof your life,Mozambican builder José Joaquim is determined to never again put his family through the terror of living through a cyclone in a flimsy house.,2024-01-11,"Mozambican builder José Joaquim is determined to never again put his family through the terror of living through a cyclone in a flimsy house. When Cyclone Idai crashed on to Mozambique's coastline five years ago, he was living with his wife and new-born baby in a shelter with corrugated iron roofing in the city of Beira. ""When the winds intensified, we were inside. Because of the noise we couldn't be sure what was happening outside. But then suddenly one of the metal roof sheets blew away,"" Mr Joaquim told the BBC. ""And then our door cracked in half because of the wind. We realised that we had to get out of there."" They struggled through winds that kept knocking them down until they reached an evacuation centre at a local school, where for safety everyone packed into the one room that had a concrete roof until the gales subsided. ""As a father I felt the responsibility to protect my child and his mother, and thank God! I made a wise decision to leave, to abandon the house so I could save my family,"" the 27-year-old says. Idai caused massive devastation and a heavy loss of life - 1,500 people died and another three million were affected across three countries. Since then other storms have hit the region and with climate change, scientists predict they will only get stronger and more dangerous. This could be catastrophic for a country with the third longest Indian Ocean coastline. Now whenever clouds gather, people here become visibly worried about the possibility of deadly floods brought on by tropical cyclones. This has forced people, like Mr Joaquim, to adapt by building stronger houses and learning safe evacuation methods. He had already been studying civil engineering at the time of Idai, but after surviving the cyclone, Mr Joaquim enrolled on a resilience construction course offered by a college called Young Africa. He has graduated but comes back to teach some of the current crop of students. Tall, friendly and wearing a high-viz waistcoat and yellow hard hat, he is happy to pass on his skills. A group of building apprentices dressed in blue overalls and safety boots have gathered around a small demonstration house. They are learning how to build a roof that has been specifically designed to withstand the extreme winds and torrential rains that come with cyclones. ""Because of the risk of the roof being blown away, we use metal fixtures to reinforce the roof,"" Mr Joaquim says. ""With these resilient construction techniques, we think it can resist at least the force of winds and heavy rains that we saw during Cyclone Idai."" As part of his course, Mr Joaquim helped Young Africa build more than 130 houses across two sites, all designed to provide better protection during a strong cyclone. These ""resilient"" homes were given to people who lost theirs during Cyclone Idai. Mr Joaquim is now putting those skills to use, offering his services to build houses for others in his community and for his own family. He showed me round his half-built house which he is hoping to complete before the next cyclone season. ""Me and my family will be safe. Because of the resilient techniques I used here, we'll be safe,"" he tells me. A stronger house provides better shelter during a storm, but there are some areas around the coastal city of Beira which are so vulnerable that people need to evacuate when a strong cyclone is predicted. The local council has set up a series of local disaster management committees. These are volunteers who work tirelessly year-round to prepare communities for emergencies, and help them evacuate safely when they arrive. One of these areas is Praia Nova, a fishing neighbourhood of the city set right on the beach. I met up with one of the volunteers that help with evacuations in the event of a storm. ""We work together whenever there's an emergency. Especially when cyclones appear suddenly, we're right there, in the community, working with them,"" says Liria Charomar in a bright orange T-shirt with a colourful wrap around her waist. She knows the importance of a safe evacuation. I noticed a scar on her leg which she says she's had since they were evacuating people through high water during Cyclone Idai. ""There were a lot of metal sheets under the water but I couldn't see them, and then when I was lifting my foot, one of them cut my leg,"" she explains. One way of providing protection to vulnerable coastal areas is replanting mangrove forests that have been cut down over the years for building materials and firewood. Between the village and the ocean there is a vast sea of green, with trees ranging from a few centimetres high to a couple of metres in Nhangau, about an hour's drive up the coast from Beira. ""The mangrove serves as a wind barrier,"" says Alberto Santos who has been working with other volunteers who've been replanting trees. ""The most intense winds come from the ocean, because the cyclones themselves come from the ocean but then there's a mangrove forest blocking the intensity of the wind. ""This is one of the protection mechanisms."" His tree-planting association has planted 1,300 hectares (3,212 acres) of mangrove seedlings over the past 15 years. But for these volunteers trying their best to help their communities, part of the solution lies far away from Mozambican shores. The fact that Mozambique has caused just a tiny amount of the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change is not lost on them. ""The residents of Beira are unhappy with this situation caused by other countries,"" says Ms Charomar. ""Here in Mozambique, we are already in trouble. We have serious problems like strong cyclones and those countries are still doing these negative things? It's not helping anyone. ""They should let us live like we always did here in Mozambique."" In the meantime, people in Beira will continue to do what they can to adapt to climate change, in the face of an uncertain future. ""It's a good feeling knowing that I learned and I'm also passing on what I know to other people,"" says Mr Joaquim. ""There's always a desire to look for a solution. So, being part of the solution is important for me, and I think it's important for other people as well.""

Many of the mysterious species were found in unlikely places, such as on the top of a volcano or clinging to Antarctic rocks. The new finds need immediate protection and at least one will probably already have been lost, the scientists say. About three-quarters of undescribed plants are threatened with extinction. The top-10 species described as new to science in 2023 are a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the natural world - and a stark warning of the dangers of biodiversity loss and climate change, the researchers say. Giving a species a scientific name was the first step towards putting protections in place and investigating potential uses for humanity, senior research leader Dr Martin Cheek said. ""The sheer sense of wonder when you realise that you've found a species that is totally unknown to the rest of the world's scientists and in fact everyone else on the planet, in many cases, is what makes life worth living,"" he told BBC News. ""It's a huge boost."" Kew's top-10 global discoveries for 2023 include: Antarctica is virtually devoid of flowering plants - but lichens can gain a foothold on small areas of exposed bare rock. Only 5-10% of all existing fungal species are known - found not just in remote unexplored areas but everywhere on the planet. Among this incredible diversity ""we are bound to discover new sources of food, medicines and other useful active compounds that can help us find nature-based solutions to some of the biggest challenges we face today,"" Kew's fungi expert, Dr Raquel Pino-Bodas, said. The plant, with spectacular bright red flowers, was found living on the summit of Mount Nok - an extinct volcano on the Indonesian island of Waigeo. The palm, named Pinanga subterranea, was found on the island of Borneo, in South East Asia. The bright red fruits and flowers are largely buried underground. The strange plant (Crepidorhopalon droseroides), from the mint family, attracts and traps insects using sticky hairs - and may digest them for food - but is unrelated to other carnivorous plants. ""I put my money on it being proved as carnivorous scientifically in the next few years,"" Dr Cheek said. ""And if that is verified, this will be a new occurrence of the evolution of carnivorous plants being recorded."" The trees were discovered growing beneath the Kalahari sands of highland Angola, in central Africa. Only small parts, such as the flowers, are visible on the surface. One, known as Baphia arenicola or ""growing on sand"", belongs to the bean family and has white flowers. The second, Cochlospermum adjanyae, has bright yellow flowers. ""This is such a curiosity for scientists and here are two new species of these very little but very curious underground forests,"" Dr Cheek said. The plant has survived thanks to a strange beautiful bird with a blue beak, known as the helmet vanga, which attracts visitors. Villagers have maintained pockets of forest where the bird lives, in turn safeguarding the habitat of the orchids, which sport pale translucent flowers. Other discoveries include: On average, scientists name about 2,500 new species of plants and 2,500 new species of fungi every year - and it is estimated there are as many as 100,000 plants yet to be formally identified. For fungi, the figure is much higher.","['Botany', 'Biodiversity', 'Plants', 'Extinction', 'Climate']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/146D2/production/_132266638_resizedcrepidorhopalondroseroides-credit-bartwursten.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2F22/production/_132266021_resizednicotianaolens-credit-maartenchristenhuszrbgkew-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/80BC/production/_132265923_resizedarthoniaolechiana-credit-j.etayo.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1159A/production/_132266017_resizeddendrobiumlancilabiumsubsp.wuryae-credit-yanuarishaqdwicahyo.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7D42/production/_132266023_resizedpinangasubterranea-credit-williamjbakerrbgkew-3.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CEDC/production/_132265925_resizedbaphiaarenicola-credit-davidgoyderrbgkew-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/329C/production/_132265921_resizedaeranthesbigibbum-credit-johanhermansrbgkew-1.jpg']",['Helen Briggs'],Climate,Climate Change

Al-Shabab fighters seized the helicopter, with unverified reports suggesting that a passenger was shot dead, the source told the BBC. A further six people on board are being held by the militants, while two reportedly escaped, the source added. The helicopter was on a medical mission when it landed near a village. The UN mission in Somalia confirmed an ""aviation incident"" on Wednesday involving a UN-contracted helicopter. It did not mention al-Shabab, but said ""response efforts are under way"". The UN source told the BBC one of the people on board was Somali, while the other eight were from elsewhere in Africa, and Europe. The foreign nationals include the person reported to have been killed and the two who managed to escape. Their fate is unclear. All nine, including the four-member crew, were third-party contractors, and not UN staff. Some of them were medics, the UN source said. The helicopter was heading to Wisil town near the frontlines of a government offensive against al-Shabab when it crash-landed after being struck by an unspecified object, the source added. Somali military official Major Hassan Ali told Reuters news agency on Wednesday that the aircraft was ""carrying medical supplies and it was supposed to transport injured soldiers from Galgudud region"". Al-Shabab controls large parts of southern and central Somalia. The group is affiliated to al-Qaeda and has waged a brutal insurgency for nearly 20 years. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) posted on social media on Wednesday night that the aircraft was ""not a WFP or UN Humanitarian Air Service craft and no WFP personnel were aboard"". The WFP added that as a precaution, its flights in the area had been temporarily suspended.

Last December Red Tabara, a Burundian rebel group, killed 20 people near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Rwandan President Paul Kagame denies the charge, but Burundi's government has branded him a ""bad neighbour"". ""We have stopped ties with him until he changes'' said Burundi's Interior Minister Martin Niteretse. Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye made the accusation in December following the attack. The Rwandan government responded that it ""regrets the unilateral closure of the border by Burundi"", according to AFP. It said the border closure was an ""unfortunate decision"" which violated the principles of regional cooperation and the integration of the East Africa Community. Red Tabara admitted to carrying out the December attack, but said they had only killed nine soldiers and one police officer. The group operates from DR Congo's South Kivu province bordering Burundi. It was not immediately clear whether the border closure included both land and air. In 2015 Burundi closed its border to Rwanda due to political tensions and then because of Covid-19. Six years later the borders reopened. During that time only land crossings were permitted. But the airline carrier RwandAir never stopped its commercial flights to Burundi.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-11,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations' top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide. But its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told a committee of MPs he was ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza. But he said of South Africa's claim: ""I don't think that is helpful. ""I don't agree with it. ""I don't think it's right."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. ""Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa. ""As a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, discrimination, racism and state-sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the right side of history.""

Poor sanitation in some densely populated urban areas was a good breeding ground for cholera, he said. To decongest major towns, residents should relocate to rural areas where there was enough space and ""perfect sanitation"", Mr Hichilema added. More than 7,500 cholera cases have been reported nationwide since last October. In the last 24 hours, there were more than 500 new cases and 17 deaths, the health ministry said. The reopening of schools has been delayed as part of a series of preventative measures. The disease has so far spread to eight of Zambia's 10 provinces. The World Health Organization (WHO) is to send about one million cholera vaccine doses in the coming days in a bid to contain the outbreak. On Wednesday, Mr Hichilema visited the Heroes Stadium Cholera Treatment Centre, where there are more than 1,000 patients, in the capital, Lusaka. He said the government would take some ""hard to swallow"" measures in an effort to eradicate the waterborne disease. He appeared to blame some Zambians who moved to towns ""without a clear objective"" for the mushrooming of poorly planned informal settlements. Some young people were ""hanging around and doing nothing"" in towns instead of moving to rural areas to farm, the president said. ""There is so much land in the villages, there is clean water. We can build nice homes in the villages, which are not polluted,"" Mr Hichilema said. The authorities would upgrade existing slums in towns, and .prevent the emergence of new ones, he added. Neighbouring Mozambique and Zimbabwe have heightened surveillance to prevent cross-border transmission. For months now, Zimbabwe has also been battling to stem the spread of cholera because the country lacks clean water. The bacterial disease is spread by contaminated water or food, and causes severe dehydration from vomiting and diarrhoea. It can kill within hours if left untreated.",['Zambia'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17DDC/production/_132265779_cholera.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F8A9/production/_132275636_ff5782e5-6b48-457f-ac5e-c1fafae77769.jpg']",['Wycliffe Muia'],World,Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67942642,Maldives: Maldivians debate India's 'boycott' of their nation,"In cafés and restaurants lining the narrow streets of Male, the capital of Maldives, the hot topic of discussion is how a spat with India got out of control - and what would be Delhi's reaction to it.",2024-01-11,"In cafés and restaurants lining the narrow streets of Male, the capital of Maldives, the hot topic of discussion is how a spat with India got out of control - and what would be Delhi's reaction to it. Following the ""derogatory"" comments made by three Maldivian junior ministers against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the tourism paradise is in danger of facing a boycott by Indian tourists - who are one of the largest contributors to the country's income. Indians were the largest group of tourists by nationality that visited the Maldives last year. Tourism accounts for almost one third of the country's economy. The ministers, who have since been suspended, had called Mr Modi a ""clown"", a ""terrorist"" and a ""puppet of Israel"" on social media. The comments sparked outrage and boycott calls against Maldives on Indian social media. The controversial posts were deleted following the uproar and the Maldivian foreign ministry put out a statement saying the comments made by the ministers were personal and did not represent the views of the government. The Maldives consists of about 1,200 coral islands and atolls located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The archipelago has a population of about 520,000 compared to India's 1.4 billion. As a small island nation, the country depends on its giant neighbour India for most of its food, infrastructure building, and technological advancement. Several residents in Male say they are worried the diplomatic spat could hamper relations between the two countries. ""We were disappointed with the boycott calls [from India]. But we were more disappointed with our government. There was a lack of good judgement on the part of our officials"", Mariyam Eem Shafeeg, a student at the Maldivian National University told the BBC. Others point out that Maldives also has strong cultural ties with India as people there grow up watching Bollywood films and dramas. ""We also depend on India for food, education and healthcare, Ms Shafeeg, a supporter of Maldivian Democratic Party, added. The Maldivian Democratic Party has had a ""India first"" policy and is believed to have close ties with Delhi. The three Maldivian officials made the controversial comments in response to Mr Modi's post on X (formerly Twitter) which included photos promoting tourism to the Indian island chain of Lakshadweep. Following the uproar, many Indians on social media said they were cancelling their holiday plans in the Maldives. Shortly after, the CEO of Indian ticket-booking site EaseMyTrip announced that his company had suspended all flight bookings to the country. Abdulla Ghiyas, president of the Maldives association of travel agents and tour operators, said there have not been a lot of cancellations at resorts and hotels. ""But we have seen some sort of slowdown in bookings,"" he added. The entire controversy has erupted at a time when the Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu has embarked on a state visit to Beijing. Mr Muizzu, who's known for his pro-China policy, has requested Beijing to send more tourists to Maldives. Chinese tourists used to dominate visitors to the Maldives before the Covid-19 pandemic. But tour operators say the number has dropped significantly, perhaps due to high ticket prices and fewer flights. ""China was our number one market pre-Covid, and it is my request that we intensify efforts for China to regain this position,"" Mr Muizzu said during his visit. But several Maldivians have criticised Mr Muizzu for not taking stronger action against the three lawmakers for their controversial remarks. ""The ministers should have been sacked straightaway. We are worried now about India's reaction as we depend on our neighbour for most of our food items,"" Aik Ahmed Easa, a lawyer affiliated with the opposition told the BBC. The Confederation of All India Traders, one of the biggest trade bodies in the country, has asked its members to stop doing business with the Maldives until the authorities there issue an apology. Many, however, point out that calls for a boycott could also affect Indians who live in the Maldives. It is estimated that around 33,000 Indians work in the country's construction, hospitality and retail sectors. ""A significant number of Indians are also working in the Maldives tourism sector, many of them as managers and front office staff,"" Mr Ghiyas said. Already, there is tension between India and the island nation after Mr Muizzu asked a contingent of 77 Indian troops to leave the country after he came to power in November last year. India says its security personnel are in the island nation to maintain three maritime rescue and surveillance aircraft it had donated to the country. The Indian Ocean archipelago has long been under India's sphere of influence and analysts say Mr Muizzu wants to change that. His election campaign was centred on 'India out' policy, with a promise to send Indian troops home and reduce Delhi's influence. ""Mr Muizzu's rhetoric really reinforced anti-India sentiment within his voter base. That possibly could have encouraged the junior ministers to make such controversial statements openly against India,"" Azim Zahir, a Maldivian political analyst, said. Though many in the Maldives say they reject the ""disrespectful"" comments on India and Mr Modi, there's also an argument that any possible coercive diplomatic action by Delhi could backfire. ""It could push Mr Muizzu further towards China or any other power in the region"" Mr Zahir said. A former senior Indian diplomat, Nirupama Menon Rao, said Delhi could have stepped in to reassure Male amid calls for economic boycott on social media. ""This is where we need Indian government spokesmen to step in and course correct keeping larger, and crucial, security and strategic interests in mind. Maldives is NOT our Cuba,"" she wrote on X.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67942289,Papua New Guinea: At least 15 dead after major rioting and looting,A state of emergency has been declared in Papua New Guinea's capital after at least 15 people were killed in rioting.,2024-01-11,"A state of emergency has been declared in Papua New Guinea's capital after at least 15 people were killed in rioting. More than 1,000 troops are on standby ""to step in wherever necessary"", Prime Minister James Marape said on Thursday. Shops and cars were torched and supermarkets looted after police went on strike on Wednesday over a pay cut the authorities say was a mistake. The unrest follows wider tensions in the Pacific Island nation over rising costs and high unemployment. ""Breaking the law does not achieve certain outcomes,"" Mr Marape said in a national address. He announced the state of emergency in Port Moresby would last for 14 days. While most of the violence had been curbed by Wednesday evening, after soldiers were deployed and police resumed duty, the prime minister acknowledged that the situation was ""still tense"". The Port Moresby General Hospital confirmed eight deaths in the capital, while another seven people were reported to have died in the city of Lae, PNG's second largest. The absence of police encouraged people from the capital's outskirts to ransack shops and cause wider destruction, locals told the BBC. ""We have seen unprecedented level of strife in our city, something that has never happened before in the history of our city and our country,"" National Capital District Governor Powes Parkop said in a radio address on Wednesday, according to a Reuters news agency report. He said the looting had largely been carried out by ""opportunists"". Some violence was also reported to have been carried out by police demonstrators. The unrest was triggered after police and other public servants staged a protest strike outside parliament on Wednesday, after discovering that their wages had been reduced by up to 50% in their latest pay cheques. In response, Mr Marape said the pay cut was an error due to a computer glitch - which had deducted up to $100 (£78) from the pay cheques of public servants. He said the administrative error would be corrected in next month's payments. But this answer was not accepted by many protesters, some of whom then tried to push into the parliament building - with footage showing people torching a car outside the prime minister's compound and overrunning a gate. Many pointed to claims on social media that the government was raising income taxes, an assertion denied by the government. ""Social media picked up on this wrong information, misinformation,"" said Mr Marape, according to the New York Times, adding that people had taken advantage of police being off the streets. Port Moresby resident Maholopa Laveil told the BBC that opportunists had ransacked the city, setting many buildings and small shopping centres on fire and stealing cars. The worst of the violence happened during the day. ""We had a lot of fear for people who were working in the shopping centres and offices - there was a lot of glee and excitement from the people who were attacking and entering the shops,"" he said. Mr Laveil, who is an economics lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea, also said most of the people looting appeared to be from the poorer settlements outside the city. ""They had come on when they heard the police had stood down and were not policing the city. ""These are suburbs with really poor people, who don't have jobs and who contribute to a lot of crime and lawlessness in the city. Many have suffered a lot from not being employed - inflation pressures - and they came out in numbers trying to get what they could from the shops nearest to them,"" he said. Ambulance officials said they had attended to several shooting injuries, while the US embassy reported shots near its compound. The Chinese embassy has also lodged a complaint with the PNG government, saying several Chinese businesses were attacked and two Chinese nationals injured. ""The Chinese Embassy in Papua New Guinea has lodged solemn representations with the Papua New Guinea side over the attacks on the Chinese shops,"" the embassy said on WeChat. Amid an economic slump in his country that has seen higher inflation and unemployment rates, the prime minister has faced increased pressure and public resentment from many groups. The political opposition has also been working on a motion to hold a vote of no confidence in Mr Marape, scheduled for February. ""Households are doing it tough, there's growing inequality within urban centres particularly the capital city and we've got a growing number of settlements and high crime rates,""  Mr Laveil said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-67931901,China and Taiwan: Love and longing across the strait,Shanshan had never met anyone from Taiwan before January last year.,2024-01-11,"Shanshan had never met anyone from Taiwan before January last year. The 24-year-old, from Changsha City in central China, had also not really paid much attention to news about the self-governing island, which her country believes is Chinese territory and has promised to take one day. But then she fell in love - she met her Taiwanese boyfriend playing online video games. They started chatting for hours, long talks during which she discovered he was ""gentle and sensitive"". But even as Shanshan and her partner Guodong share sweet messages across the Taiwan Strait - preparing to meet her parents during the Chinese New Year festival - their governments are trading a ramped-up war of words in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential elections on Saturday. China's President Xi Jinping has cast the decision at Taiwan's ballot box as a choice between war and peace. Under his leadership, Beijing has taken an ever sharper, firmer and often more aggressive tone towards the democratically-governed island, warning the world that it alone will decide how and when unification will happen. However, despite regular military activities in the Taiwan Strait, President Xi has also repeatedly offered ""peaceful reunification"", while Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office maintains that ""both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family"". But those most likely to listen to this message are its own people - not those living across the strait. Shanshan and Guodong have very different views on the future of Taiwan. ""My boyfriend just wants to maintain the status quo and doesn't want independence or unification. But I support our country's position and hope for unification one day. We only discuss, we don't argue. The key is that we can't change these things, so we hope for positive developments,"" she says. Their differing views have not affected their relationship. And yet, the issue has created very real barriers for the couple. China banned ""individual tourists"" from visiting Taiwan in 2019. That means Shanshan cannot visit her partner's home or his parents, and she wonders if that will ever change. But things are not much easier for Guodong when he arrives in China. Shanshan has discovered that she and her boyfriend may share the same language, and her government says they are the same people, but he faces the same hurdles as many foreigners hoping to settle in mainland China. The administration and paperwork involved for either one of them to stay with the other for any length of time is substantial. Paying for most things involves the need to generate a QR code on pre-registered Chinese phones, with Chinese apps linked to Chinese bank accounts - none of which he has. ""For example, when he comes to visit, buying tickets, booking hotels, and making payments are challenging, and even going to tourist sites, taking taxis, or going to the bank, he faces difficulties,"" Shanshan explains. ""After being together, I realised that there are many cross-strait couples facing restrictions and difficulties in meeting each other, and the marriage process is complicated and tedious."" China's relationship with Taiwan is therefore critical for this couple. Closer ties could make it easier for them to move between countries. For them, politics across the strait is tangible. For others in China, Taiwan is part of a vision - the government's view of the future. State media highlights the ties between the two as a shining beacon of brotherhood and shared cultural heritage. On a rocky outcrop of Pingtan island in Fujian province, the closest part of the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, tourists pay to stand on a platform and peer through binoculars at an outline of Taiwan 68 nautical miles  (126km) away. Many have travelled thousands of miles to get here. They brave the biting January winds and struggle to brace themselves against the gales as they stare out to sea over the rising white horses. Sea fog and cloud obscure any view of Taiwan, but still, they line up to take photographs at a strategically placed stone arch, using their arms to make love heart signs above their heads. For some, this is a poignant moment. Cui Xiuwen has come from northwest China's Shaanxi province in the hope of just a glimpse of Taiwan. ""My biggest wish after visiting here is that I hope the island of Taiwan can return to our motherland soon,"" the 61-year-old tells us excitedly. ""The urge and feeling became stronger while I've been here. In the past I didn't feel this so keenly. Our compatriots are watching each other across the water and we cannot unite."" She hugs our team warmly as she talks about her fear of conflict. ""We see and hear much talk about Taiwan and the mainland on TV. That's why I want to come here quickly and look at it. I hope Taiwan will be reclaimed in a peaceful way. I don't want war. The casualties will be huge. We want peace."" One young couple - dressed head to toe in Christian Dior - pose for their social media feeds in sunglasses while gazing wistfully out to sea. They stand in stark contrast to some of those who live and work on this island, who admit to rarely thinking about their neighbour, just a few hours away by boat. Dozens of local workers gather in groups on the concrete walls of the small port on the island to sort abalone shells for harvesting. Huddling together out of the wind, wrapped up in fleece headscarves and fishing overalls, they barely look up as they speak to us. They need to keep working to earn money - that is their main concern. ""I don't feel a connection. I have no friends or relatives there,"" says one woman as she uses her knife to scrape through the baskets to release the shellfish. ""I don't care whether it's reunified or not. We ordinary people don't care. This is up to the officials.  We have no wish or hope. We just want enough to eat, we want a better life. We don't care about other things."" Read more about the Taiwan election: There are around 40 million people living in Fujian province. Many Taiwanese are thought to be descendants of Fujian immigrants, and Beijing often uses these ties as an argument for closer economic and social integration. It wants Fujian province to be the model for ""peaceful unification with the motherland"". It's part of what analysts call a ""carrot and stick"" approach to Taiwan. Or more recently - a display of warships and wooing. China has named its new aircraft carrier after Fujian. It unveiled new images of its first domestically designed warship on state television just last week - part of President Xi's goal of making the People's Liberation Army a ""world class military"". But alongside these flashy displays of military power, there is some evidence that Beijing is attempting to entice more Taiwanese people to the mainland. The Chinese government has unveiled a detailed plan this week to try to bring more Taiwanese investors to Fujian and to encourage Taiwan residents to study, work and live in the south-eastern province. One block of flats in Fuzhou, the BBC found, was even going as far as to offer incredibly cheap rent to Taiwanese people. ""Welcome home"" said the sign on the front door, but when we spoke to a real estate agent they said that any such rental agreement needed permission from various government departments. China also plans to build a high-speed railway across the strait ""at an early date"". The simple fact is the two need each other, economically. China is Taiwan's biggest trading partner, and exports to China have enabled its economy to enjoy strong growth. In an alleyway in Fuzhou, the main city in Fujian province, Li Haoyu from Taiwan tosses noodles into the sizzling wok as customers on mopeds wait for their dinner. He came to China seven years ago for a job at a funeral home. His path from there is a little vague, he's not even sure how old he is. He hasn't been back for five years, but has to return soon as his travel permit to China will soon expire. Taiwanese noodles have a simpler flavour, he says as his swirls the hot pan over the fire. World headlines about war and business worries across the Taiwan Strait do not worry him. He is only concerned with the flow of customers in his street. But he knows the relationship between his past and current homes are not good. ""I think the feelings are good between the people. But I don't know how the two governments feel about each other,"" he says as he carefully loads the noodles into a bowl. ""I hope ties can be normalized. I hope the two sides can be like two brothers, like a family,"" he adds. The ties between Taiwan and China after this election could also have an impact on Shanshan's blossoming relationship. Beijing has already warned that any attempt to push for Taiwan's formal independence will mean conflict - although many doubt Beijing will want a war on its doorstep as it battles an economic downturn. All Shanshan can do is ""hope for a better cross-strait relationship"". Luckily, their own relationship is going well, she adds. ""Despite the distance, we can be together. Both of us hope for a future together. We can accept these difficulties, and even if it's challenging, we will support and help each other.""","['Asia', 'Taiwan']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/464C/production/_132269971_couple-gettyimages-149817112.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1A51/production/_132273760_2024d2f7-4dae-489d-a2ad-57a6f51c69dd.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2163/production/_132274580_c8678a67-aac4-400e-80dd-e776c874c8be.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175F9/production/_132273759_cef51494-a9e5-4250-aec9-2dbe04f3bb00.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/1992/production/_132164560_taiwan_flight_paths_map-stripped_back_2x640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8F81/production/_132273763_3ea21db7-ccc2-4ad7-8574-27eb09cb575c.jpg']",['Laura Bicker'],World,Asia

The men, named in media reports as Brandon Maseuli and Yousef Rima, are part of an international criminal syndicate that originated in Lebanon. Police said the group takes on contracts to carry out violent crimes such as murders and kidnappings. Arrested in Sydney on Thursday, Maseuli, 26, and Rima, 20, have been handed multiple charges. They include conspiracy to murder, kidnapping, directing a criminal group, and various drug and robbery-related offences. Authorities have also applied for an arrest warrant for a 22-year-old man who is believed to be offshore. Police said Maseuli and Rima had conspired to murder ""four high-profile men from Sydney's northwest on behalf of another network"". Their targets have been identified as four members of the drill rap group OneFour - Jerome ""J Emz"" Misa, Pio ""YP"" Misa, Spencer ""Spenny"" Magalogo and Dahcell ""Celly"" Ramos. It is unclear why the fifth member, Salec ""Lekks"" Su'a, was not targeted. The plot against the OneFour members is believed to have been sparked by a conflict between the rappers and the group that allegedly hired the criminal syndicate's Sydney cell, the Sydney Morning Herald said, citing police authorities. Police discovered the alleged plot as part of a broader investigation into the Sydney cell, which Maseuli and Rima are part of. They also allege that it was linked to several kidnappings, including one involving more than 722kg (1,600 pounds) of cocaine. Both suspects appeared before the Liverpool Local Court on Thursday. They were refused bail. OneFour, who are among Australia's best known rap groups, have themselves had several run-ins with Australia police. Their music often includes dark themes and violent lyrics, which police claim can incite violence.

A win for the ruling party candidate William Lai would pose a danger to relations, China said. It also criticised ""brazen chattering"" by the US after Washington warned Beijing not to stoke tensions ahead of Saturday's vote. Who wins the poll could push the island further towards, or away from, Beijing. Taiwan is a key flashpoint in the tussle between China and the US for supremacy in Asia. China's Taiwan Affairs office said Mr Lai would further promote separatist activities if he were elected. ""[He] would continue to follow the evil path of provoking 'independence' and... take Taiwan ever further away from peace and prosperity, and ever closer to war and decline,"" it said in a statement. Mr Lai, of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has called for voters to ""choose the right path"" to maintain Taiwan's sovereignty.   His main opponent, Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang (KMT), has called Mr Lai a danger to relations with China. Many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. The island sees itself as distinct from the mainland - but China's government says it is a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. Mr Lai had been narrowly in front in the presidential race before polling stopped on 2 January. Parliamentary elections are also being held. China's message to voters came as it told the US to stop commenting on the election. The foreign ministry in Beijing issued a sharp rebuke to Washington after the US said it would send an unofficial delegation to Taiwan after the vote. The US government must ""refrain from intervening in the elections... so as to avoid causing serious damage to US-China relations"", a spokesperson said. China ""expresses... resolute opposition to the American side's brazen chattering about the elections in the Taiwan region"". Beijing has said Taiwan's voters face a choice between peace and war in the elections. On Thursday's Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu criticised China for its ""repeated interference"" in Saturday's vote. ""Frankly, Beijing should stop messing with other countries' elections & hold their own,"" Mr Wu posted on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter.","['Asia', 'Taiwan']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C72B/production/_132278905_5f41ff19-542d-4793-bd43-5e4b91078cc6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/07C3/production/_132278910_mediaitem132278907.jpg']",['Simon Fraser'],World,Asia

The icon depicts scenes from the life of St Matrona of Moscow, a 20th Century Russian visionary and healer. In one, the Russian Orthodox saint can be seen blessing Stalin. The Patriarchate of Georgia said there was ""insufficient evidence"" the saint and Stalin ever met and that changes therefore needed to be made. ""The donors of the icon are called upon to make the appropriate changes to the image themselves - or we can do it ourselves,"" the statement said. The Alliance of Patriots, a pro-Russian political party, said it gifted the icon to the cathedral several months ago. But it only came to prominence this year, after an opposition former politician Giorgi Kandelaki highlighted its presence in protest at what he said was an attempt to present ""one of the biggest mass murderers in history"" in a ""positive light"". The icon has been courting controversy since Mr Kandelaki drew attention to it. Earlier this week, an activist sprayed it with paint in protest. Nata Peradze published a video of her throwing paint on the icon and said she was protesting against what she saw as the glorification of a tyrant. ""Stalin killed my whole family, he instilled terror and fear, he was not a hero,"" she told Politico, adding that she has been receiving death threats since posting the video on Facebook. She also said her house has been targeted by mobs since the incident. In its statement, the Patriarchate of Georgia said that an icon could depict ""real stories related to the life of the saint, including rulers and ordinary people, heretics and persecutors of the Christian faith"". ""However,"" it added, ""this does not mean at all that the image glorifies these figures or attributes any dignity to them."" Stalin has a complex legacy in Georgia. He was born Iosif Dzhugashvili in the town of Gori, in the east of the country, in 1878. A key figure in the Russian revolution which brought the Bolsheviks to power, he ruled the USSR from 1924 until his death in 1953. Millions died as Stalin imposed iron discipline and state terror to root out ""enemies of the people"" and build a communist state. Many people in the small South Caucasian country reject the legacy of the Soviet Union. But some still view Stalin with some pride because he emerged from a humble background in Georgia to rule a superpower and defeat Nazi Germany.","['Joseph Stalin', 'Georgia']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A723/production/_132278724_4f68a50a15c83dad73beaafc94728a6d383d45d5.jpg'],['Ido Vock'],World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67948861,German far-right met to plan 'mass deportations',German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned an alleged far-right meeting at which plans to deport millions of people were discussed.,2024-01-11,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned an alleged far-right meeting at which plans to deport millions of people were discussed. German media said politicians from the far-right AfD and neo-Nazis met at a villa near a lake outside Berlin. The deportation of people with a non-German ethnic background, including citizens, was allegedly discussed. Mr Scholz said no-one should be discriminated against because of their origins in Germany. The Correctiv investigative outlet reported that last November around 20 people attended the secret meeting near Potsdam, outside Berlin. Correctiv said that these included senior figures from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), including Roland Hartwig, a close associate of party leader Alice Weidel. Neo-Nazis from across Germany and Austria, as well as a member of the white supremacist Generation Identity group attended, the outlet said. Two members of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) party are also said to have participated. Much discussion allegedly focused on so-called ""remigration"" - the removal of people with non-German ethnic backgrounds, even if they are citizens of Germany. Correctiv reported that there were no objections over the plan in principle, only doubts over its feasibility. Officially, the AfD rejects the principle of remigration. But Gerrit Huy, an AfD member of the German Parliament, said she had believed in the idea for years. This was why, she said, the AfD no longer opposed dual citizenship: because it would allow migrants to be stripped of their German citizenship more easily, as they would have another to fall back on. Responding to the report, Mrs Huy contradicted the party's official stance by saying the AfD ""is committed to remigration"". The party confirmed to the AFP news agency that Mr Hartwig had attended the conference, but denied it would change its policy on migration. Chancellor Scholz said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter): ""We will not allow anyone to differentiate the 'we' in our country based on whether or not someone has an immigrant background."" He added that participants could be investigated by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the domestic intelligence agency. ""Learning from history is not just lip service.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67940671,Huge ancient city found in the Amazon,"A huge ancient city has been found in the Amazon, hidden for thousands of years by lush vegetation.",2024-01-11,"A huge ancient city has been found in the Amazon, hidden for thousands of years by lush vegetation. The discovery changes what we know about the history of people living in the Amazon. The houses and plazas in the Upano area in eastern Ecuador were connected by an astounding network of roads and canals. The area lies in the shadow of a volcano that created rich local soils but also may have led to the destruction of the society. While we knew about cities in the highlands of South America, like Machu Picchu in Peru, it was believed that people only lived nomadically or in tiny settlements in the Amazon. ""This is older than any other site we know in the Amazon. We have a Eurocentric view of civilisation, but this shows we have to change our idea about what is culture and civilisation,"" says Prof Stephen Rostain, director of investigation at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France, who led the research. ""It changes the way we see Amazonian cultures. Most people picture small groups, probably naked, living in huts and clearing land - this shows ancient people lived in complicated urban societies,"" says co-author Antoine Dorison. The city was built around 2,500 years ago, and people lived there for up to 1,000 years, according to archaeologists. It is difficult to accurately estimate how many people lived there at any one time, but scientists say it is certainly in the 10,000s if not 100,000s. The archaeologists combined ground excavations with a survey of a 300 sq km (116 sq mile) area using laser sensors flown on a plane that could identify remains of the city beneath the dense plants and trees. This LiDAR technology found 6,000 rectangular platforms measuring about 20m (66 ft) by 10m (33 ft) and 2-3m high. They were arranged in groups of three to six units around a plaza with a central platform. The scientists believe many were homes, but some were for ceremonial purposes. One complex, at Kilamope, included a 140m (459 ft) by 40m (131 ft) platform. They were built by cutting into hills and creating a platform of earth on top. A network of straight roads and paths connected many of the platforms, including one that extended 25km (16 miles). Dr Dorison said these roads were the most striking part of the research. ""The road network is very sophisticated. It extends over a vast distance, everything is connected. And there are right angles, which is very impressive,"" he says, explaining that it is much harder to build a straight road than one that fits in with the landscape. He believes some had a ""very powerful meaning"", perhaps linked to a ceremony or belief. The scientists also identified causeways with ditches on either side which they believe were canals that helped manage the abundant water in the region. There were signs of threats to the cities - some ditches blocked entrances to the settlements, and may be evidence of threats from nearby people. Researchers first found evidence of a city in the 1970s, but this is the first time a comprehensive survey has been completed, after 25 years of research. It reveals a large, complex society that appears to be even bigger than the well-known Mayan societies in Mexico and Central America. ""Imagine that you discovered another civilisation like the Maya, but with completely different architecture, land use, ceramics,"" says José Iriarte, a professor of archaeology at University of Exeter, who was not involved in this research. Some of the findings are ""unique"" for South America, he explains, pointing to the octagonal and rectangular platforms arranged together. The societies were clearly well-organised and interconnected, he says, highlighting the long sunken roads between settlements. Not a huge amount is known about the people who lived there and what their societies were like. Pits and hearths were found in the platforms, as well as jars, stones to grind plants and burnt seeds. The Kilamope and Upano people living there probably mostly focussed on agriculture. People ate maize and sweet potato, and probably drank ""chicha"", a type of sweet beer. Prof Rostain says he was warned against this research at the start of his career because scientists believed no ancient groups had lived in the Amazon. ""But I'm very stubborn, so I did it anyway. Now I must admit I am quite happy to have made such a big discovery,"" he says. The next step for the researchers is understanding what lies in an adjoining 300 sq km (116 sq mile) area not yet surveyed.","['Ecuador', 'Amazon rainforest', 'Archaeology']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7538/production/_132280003_6_excavation_sangay_rostain.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/15F98/production/_132280009_lost_amazon_city_v4_2x640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11178/production/_132280007_9_road_sangayupano_rostain.jpg']",['Georgina Rannard'],World,Latin America

Mr Noboa declared a state of emergency on Monday after a wave of gang violence swept through the Andean country. In the most dramatic incident, armed men stormed a TV station and threatened the staff during a live broadcast. More than 300 suspects have been arrested under the state of emergency. Mr Noboa struck a defiant tone in a radio interview on Wednesday. The 36-year-old president, who has only been in power for two months, challenged the gangs. ""Be brave, fight the soldiers,"" he told them, referring to the fact that most of those who have been targeted by the gangs have been civilians or unarmed prison guards. At least 14 people have been killed in recent days as gang members set off explosive devices, burned vehicles and kidnapped police officers on duty. One hundred and fifty-eight prison guards and 20 employees working for the prison system have also been taken hostage by inmates, officials said. An armed forces commander said on Wednesday that so far none of the hostages been killed. President Noboa said Ecuador was living through ""a very tough moment"" but insisted that his government would be tough on the gangs and ""any judges or prosecutors who back these gangs"". The current surge in attacks appears to have been kicked off by an attempt to transfer the notorious gang leader known as ""Fito"" from the jail which he largely controlled to a prison which is considered more secure. But when police entered his cell in the Regional jail on Sunday, they found it abandoned. News of his escape triggered riots in other jails, during which Fabricio Colón Pico, who is one of the leaders of the Los Lobos gang, also absconded. Neither Fito, whose real name is Adolfo Macías Villareal, nor Colón Pico have so far been tracked down. The Ecuadorean government has offered a reward for information leading to their capture. They are also offering rewards for 17 other gang leaders. Ecuador, which until recently was a relatively safe country compared to the rest of the region, saw its murder rate more than quadruple between 2018 and 2022 as criminal gangs linked to drug trafficking became more powerful. President Noboa declared 22 of these groups ""terrorist gangs"" on Tuesday and decreed that his country was involved in an ""internal armed conflict"". Ecuador's Congress has unanimously approved the measure, which allows soldiers to be deployed to patrol the streets and to search homes for weapons and suspects. The BBC's Will Grant who is in Guayaquil, the port city worst hit by the recent violence, says its residents are still struggling to make sense of the gang rampage. One of the journalists who lived through the storming of the TC television studios in Guayaquil told Ecuadorean news site Primicias how the gunmen threatened her and her colleagues. She described how the armed men demanded that the presenter make an announcement live on air. ""They wanted my colleague to say: 'The mafia is in power, the president can't beat us.'"" But she added that the gunmen did not have any clear demands beyond that. The gang was eventually overpowered by the police, which arrested 18 of them.",['Ecuador'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0C69/production/_132277130_7cd9e0ba2c2f280ddb4eb20d926701e739b1cf510_0_5760_38401000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5A89/production/_132277132_013436990932aa04f1c29450faf1bba8ebd8c14b0_0_5500_36681000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A8A9/production/_132277134_b55db89d1086610d2536fd75c1f315034251690b0_0_5500_36211000x658.jpg']",['Vanessa Buschschlüter'],World,Latin America

In an impeachment hearing on Wednesday they focused on how states have been affected by his department's actions. Impeaching a cabinet official is rare, but the border could become a key issue in the 2024 presidential election. A growing number of Americans consider the situation at the border a crisis. In December, a record number of migrants were processed at the southern border and for all of 2023 almost 2.5 million people were apprehended there. The Republican-dominated House Committee on Homeland Security has said Mr Mayorkas failed to enforce US laws at the border, which amounts to a ""dereliction of duty"". Committee chairman Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, said impeachment does not just cover criminal behaviour, but also ""gross incompetence"" that can be seen as endangering fellow Americans or betraying public trust. Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson said this is ""not a legitimate impeachment"" and suggested that Republicans were throwing ""political red meat to their base"" to keep ""campaign cash coming"". The hearing included testimony from attorneys general from Montana, Oklahoma and Missouri - states led by Republican governors -  who said they have dealt with impacts from Mr Mayorkas' policies. ""The southern border certainly presents a difficult challenge for any administration, but Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden administration have absolutely poured gasoline on this fire,"" Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen testified. House Speaker Mike Johnson recently led a delegation of Republicans to the border, where they got a ""first-hand look at the damage and chaos the border catastrophe is causing in all of our communities"". Mr Mayorkas also made a trip, one day before the impeachment hearing, where he put the blame on Congress, calling for it to fix immigration policies. He said the accusation that he does not uphold US immigration laws ""could not be further from the truth"" and in a memo his department said that Republicans were making ""baseless and pointless political attacks"" instead of fixing ""broken immigration laws"". Currently, Mr Mayorkas is working with the White House and a bipartisan group of senators to tighten those laws, which Republicans have demanded in exchange for agreeing to President Joe Biden's request for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Meanwhile, immigration has become one of the biggest hurdles facing President Biden's push for re-election. A CBS News poll, released this week, found that 63% of Americans want stricter border policies and 45% of Americans now say there is a crisis at the border. Several Democratic mayors have expressed alarm at the rising number of migrants arriving in their cities, partly due to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's policy of busing new arrivals out of his state. New York Mayor Eric Adams has previously warned the issue could ""destroy"" his city, pointing to a projection that housing the influx of migrants could cost taxpayers $12bn over the next three years. But Democratic lawmakers also say Republicans' move to remove Mr Mayorkas is politically motivated, with New York congressman Dan Goldman calling them an ""embarrassment to the impeachment clause of the Constitution"".

The US embassy in Bogota said some victims were drugged and robbed after meeting people on these apps. The incidents often occurred in cities like Medellin, Cartagena and Bogota where US tourism has picked up. Travellers are being told to avoid isolated locations like hotel rooms. Criminals use the apps to lure victims to public spaces like restaurants and bars, where they can be assaulted, robbed and even killed, sometimes by the person they meet, the embassy warned. In the final three months of 2023, the number of robberies of foreign visitors increased by 200% and deaths by 29%, including the eight Americans who died between 1 November and 31 December. One of those victims was American comedian and activist Tou Ger Xiong, 50, an Asian-American living in Minnesota. He was on vacation in Colombia at the end of November when he was kidnapped and killed after meeting a woman online and meeting her on a date. Xiong was abducted and fatally stabbed over a dozen times by a group of men. The number of foreign victims of these kinds of crimes could be higher than the figures suggest. ""These types of crimes routinely go underreported as victims are embarrassed and do not want to follow through with the judicial process,"" the embassy said. And those who try to resist or fight back against a robbery attempt are more likely to be killed, it warned.","['Dating apps', 'United States', 'Colombia']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E34B/production/_132278185_gettyimages-1303453222-1.jpg'],['Brandon Drenon'],World,Latin America
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67950833,Ecuador city tries to return to normal after gang horror,"Gradually, and with trepidation, life in Guayaquil is beginning to return.",2024-01-11,"Gradually, and with trepidation, life in Guayaquil is beginning to return. Few residents have fully recovered from the shock - from the outright chaos and bloodshed - of this week, a moment which will live long in the city's collective memory. But Dina Moreno can't afford to stay home any longer. She sells mobile phone accessories at Guayaquil's biggest covered market and, like many of her fellow stallholders, has ventured out to open her business and get back to work. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" she recalls with a shudder. ""When we saw what was happening at the TV station and we heard gunshots, everyone went crazy and started shutting up their shops and trying to get home."" Behind her, as she talks, Dina's seven-year-old son plays with some mobile phone covers. Schools in the city remain closed after the explosion of gang violence. Such was her loss of income from two days with no sales, Dina had no choice but to bring him to work. It's a similar story elsewhere in the sprawling market, as street food vendors, delivery boys and a preacher reciting Bible verses bring back the noise and bustle which has been absent since the attack. The spectre of the drug-gang violence remains, though. One vendor, Jorge, told me that the stall owners were all watching out for each other under the market's huge white awnings, keeping an eye out for the first sign of more trouble or the return of armed men to the streets. ""I'm not scared of death,"" he says, without a hint of bravado. ""I just want to see peace return to my Ecuador."" But while the small businesses of Guayaquil may be trying to get back to some form of normality, it's far from business as usual for Andres. His brother is among the 178 prison staff - most of them guards - still being held hostage by the gangs. ""The only information we've had is from the guards who managed to get out. They're the only ones who have told us that our relatives are OK,"" he tells me from outside the Ambato prison, where he's spent hours waiting for news. The police will only tell the desperate family members that they're waiting for orders to enter the prison. Andres says they haven't seen any movement from them in days. He adds that the guards had warned that something bad was going to happen in the prison, but the authorities didn't listen. The government insists that the country is now engaged in a war with the gangs and cannot back down in the face of intimidation, from either inside or outside the prisons. ""Hostage-taking is the ugly part of war,"" President Daniel Noboa said this week. That is of little comfort to Andres though, who accuses the government of negligence and of forgetting about his brother. ""I just hope they're not going to treat them as cannon-fodder,"" he says. Amid the chaos, the most brazen act of gang violence was in the TC television studio in Guayaquil when armed men took staff hostage, brandishing weapons at the journalists live on air. In the ensuing ordeal, presenter Jose Luis Calderon could be seen urging the gang members to stay calm, even while they pointed a shotgun at his head and placed a stick of dynamite in his breast-pocket. ""I felt strangely calm even though I knew our lives were at risk,"" he recalls when we met him afterwards. Jose Luis described how he hid in a bathroom with a several colleagues when they heard yelling and gunfire. But their hiding place was soon discovered, and they were hauled out to join the other staff on set, at gunpoint. ""They sent kids, armed to the teeth, to spread fear, uncertainty, anxiety and chaos,"" he says. ""They were there to send the message that they can just walk in and take over one of the biggest media outlets in the country."" Hundreds of gang members have now been detained by the police. While the streets of Guayaquil are empty during the night-time curfew, by day they're getting busier as people come and go about their normal business. As the days pass from the most terrifying experience in its modern history, it is beginning to look like Ecuador is returning to normality. The risk is that it is actually hurtling towards an entrenched armed conflict, and moving ever closer to becoming a full ""narco-state"".","['Ecuador', 'Gangs']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DF32/production/_132283175_gettyimages-1913162315.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/154C6/production/_132283278_dina3.jpg']",['Will Grant'],World,Latin America

Armed men wearing masks reportedly boarded the vessel St Nikolas, close to the Omani port of Sohar, and ordered it to sail to an Iranian port. Iranian state media, quoting the navy, said the seizure was in retaliation for the ship and oil it had aboard being confiscated by the US last year. The St Nikolas was in transit between the Iraqi port of Basra and its intended destination in Turkey. UK Maritime Trade Operations said on Thursday it had received a report that four to five ""unauthorised persons"", reportedly wearing ""military style black uniforms with black masks"", had boarded the ship at 03:30 GMT. They added that communications with the vessel had been lost and the authorities were investigating. Iranian state media quoted the army as saying the vessel is American, although it is Greek-owned. The company that manages it, Empire Navigation, said it was loaded with 145,000 tonnes of crude oil and was carrying 18 Filipinos and one Greek citizen as crew. The St Nikolas was seized in April by the US under its previous name, the Suez Rajan, as part of sanctions enforcement against Iran. Suez Rajan Limited, which formerly chartered the ship, later pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate sanctions by covertly selling and transporting oil abroad on behalf of Iran. The US has called for the immediate release of the vessel and its crew, describing the seizure as the latest attempt by Iran to disrupt international commerce. ""We believe this kind of action will simply add uncertainty for commercial shipping and for regional and global economies,"" said US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel. This latest act appears to be separate from attacks carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen in the Red Sea on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula. Thursday's incident was in a different ocean from the Houthis' usual area of operations - where they have been attacking any ships they suspect of being linked to Israel in retaliation for the country's actions in Gaza. The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels following the largest attack yet. Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night. The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday demanding an immediate end to the Houthi attacks.","['Iran', 'Middle East']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31AE/production/_132281721_iran-tanker-reuters.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1832E/production/_132281199_iranmap.png']",['Kathryn Armstrong'],World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67946441,Gaza journalists’ families reject Israeli military's ‘terrorist’ claims,"The families of the two Palestinian journalists killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza have rejected as ""fabricated"" and ""false"" a new claim from Israel's military that they were ""terrorists"".",2024-01-11,"The families of the two Palestinian journalists killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza have rejected as ""fabricated"" and ""false"" a new claim from Israel's military that they were ""terrorists"". The Qatar-based Al Jazeera news network, for whom one of the journalists worked, also condemned what it called the ""false and misleading attempts to justify the killing of our colleagues"". Hamza al-Dahdouh, an Al Jazeera journalist and cameraman, and Mustafa Thuraya, a freelance videographer, died after their car was hit in the southern city of Rafah on Sunday. A third journalist was reportedly seriously injured. Al Jazeera said at the time that it strongly condemned the ""assassination"" of the journalists ""whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty"" during the war between Israel and Hamas. It also accused Israel of ""systematically targeting"" Dahdouh's family. His father, Wael, is the network's Gaza bureau chief and he has now lost five members of his immediate family in Israeli strikes. In an initial statement about Sunday's strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it ""identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops."" ""We are aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit,"" it added. But, when the IDF's chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari was asked by US network NBC on Monday if it had evidence to support the claims, he appeared to contradict the statement. ""Every journalist that dies it's unfortunate,"" he said. ""We understand they were putting a drone, using a drone. And using a drone in a war zone, it's a problem. It looks like the terrorists,"" he added. ""So we will investigate this incident and we will provide the data."" NBC also cited Al Jazeera's managing editor Mohamed Moawad as saying that Mustafa Thuraya was a drone operator and that he was driving back to Rafah with Hamza al-Dahdouh after filming the aftermath of an air strike. He added that that they were not flying a drone while travelling. When approached again for a response, the IDF said it had no further comment and referred the BBC to Adm Hagari's NBC interview. On Wednesday night, the IDF put out another statement about the incident which said an Israeli aircraft targeted the operators of a ""hostile drone near Rafah"" and that Palestinian media had subsequently identified them as journalists. ""However, IDF intelligence has confirmed that both the deceased were members of Gaza-based terrorist organizations actively involved in attacks against IDF forces,"" it added. It alleged that troops in Gaza had found a document that identified Mustafa Thuraya as a ""member of Hamas' Gaza City Brigade, serving as squad deputy commander in the Qadisiya Battalion"". Troops had also found documents that showed Hamza al-Dahdouh's ""role in the Islamic Jihad's electronic engineering unit and his previous role as a deputy commander in the Zeitoun Battalion's Rocket Array"", it added. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is the second largest armed group in Gaza and, like Hamas, it is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others. The IDF released a photograph of one document in Arabic that included Hamza al-Dahdouh's name among a list of ""operatives from the electronic engineering unit"" of PIJ. The image is very poor quality, making it hard to assess its authenticity independently. However, two regional experts told BBC Verify that the use of English alongside Arabic in the document was unusual. Erik Skare, a researcher at France's Sciences Po university who has written a book on PIJ, said: ""I regularly visited the website of the al-Quds Brigades... I have read their martyr biographies, their books etc, and I have never seen the combination of English and Arabic text."" The IDF did not provide other photo or video evidence about Hamza al-Dahdouh, nor did it release any of the documents that it said showed Mustafa Thuraya's alleged links to Hamas. The BBC asked the IDF to share further evidence, but it said: ""At this point we have nothing to add."" Asked to comment on the allegations, Hamza al-Dahdouh's family told the BBC on Thursday: ""It is clear that these are Israeli fabrications in an attempt to defend themselves and justify the targeting of Hamza and the journalists and divert the issue from its track to make it appear that it is not targeting journalists."" ""Israel is under international pressure and from the American administration. Israel wants to divert attention and create pretexts,"" it added. ""Hamza has been working as a journalist for many years, and during this war he was doing his journalistic work and was displaced with his colleagues and family like other Palestinians."" Mustafa Thuraya's cousin also told the AFP news agency that the IDF's claim was ""false"". ""He was an ambitious and professional young man who was known among journalists for his work,"" Mohammed Thuraya said, adding that his cousin had sold photos and videos taken with his drone to local and international news outlets. Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement sent to the BBC that it ""strongly condemns and wholly rejects - and indeed expresses its very considerable surprise at - the Israeli army's false and misleading attempts to justify the killing of our colleague Hamza Wael al-Dahdouh and other journalists"". ""[Hamza al-Dahdouh] was killed simply for doing his job and for shining a light on events that the Israeli army would rather stayed in the dark and hidden from scrutiny,"" it added. ""Al Jazeera rejects all accusations made against our journalists and calls on the international community to ensure that the IDF is held fully accountable for its crimes."" Hamza was the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief, Wael al-Dahdouh. Wael's wife, Amna, his one-year-old grandson Adam, his 15-year-old son Mahmoud and seven-year-old daughter Sham were killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp in October - a place they had gone to flee the fighting in the north. Wael was injured in an Israeli drone strike in December that killed his colleague, Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abudaqa. The pair had been covering the Israeli bombardment at a UN school sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called for an independent investigation into the strike. At least 79 journalists and media workers - 72 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese - have been killed since the start of the war, according to the group. The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. More than 23,400 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","['Palestinian territories', 'Israel & the Palestinians', 'Gaza', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Press freedom', 'Israel', 'Media']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6930/production/_132282962_mediaitem132282958.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4E46/production/_132283002_ef5d8fbeb7a6a37e959b5c756fc412349b5f08ed.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12898/production/_132282957_mediaitem132282956.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13B5C/production/_132223708_adsz.png']","['Shaimaa Khalil', 'David Gritten']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67946344,Oil prices rise after Iran seizes oil tanker,"Oil prices have risen after Iran seized a tanker off the coast of Oman, raising concerns fuel prices could increase.",2024-01-11,"Oil prices have risen after Iran seized a tanker off the coast of Oman, raising concerns fuel prices could increase. The oil tanker was heading for Turkey on Thursday when armed men ordered it to sail to an Iranian port. The price of Brent crude oil jumped by more than 2%, to $78.40 a barrel following the incident. Iranian state media is reporting the seizure is a retaliation for the hijacking last year of the same vessel by the US. The act raises prospects of growing conflict in the Middle East, which could have a knock-on effect on UK fuel prices. A rise in oil prices can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%. The average price of a litre fell below £1.40 on Thursday for the first time since October 2021, according to motoring group, the AA. Diesel now averages 147.83p a litre across the country, down to a level last seen in early August. This time last year, petrol and diesel averaged 149.47p and 171.93p a litre respectively. ""Drivers should be ready for pump price volatility, perhaps even a shock, but current pump prices are a huge relief for consumers and inflationary pressures,"" the AA's Luke Jones added. This most recent incident appears to be separate from attacks carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen in the Red Sea, on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula. But as Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics points out, the reaction in the oil market has been fairly muted to these attacks and the Israel-Hamas war. ""Initially, when the war broke out, there were fears that some of the major oil producers in the region - particularly Iran, but also Saudi Arabia - would become actively involved,"" she said. However, this no longer appears as likely and the risk of disruption to oil supply has been reduced. Demand for oil has dropped, following the slowdown in the EU and US economies and lack of growth in China, so there is less fear of supply shortfalls. Conversely, there has been a ""surprisingly strong growth in US oil production in 2023 and in some other non-OPEC producers such as Brazil and Guyana,"" Ms Bain said, which has ""allayed fears of disruption to Middle East supply."" ""If there were a further escalation in tensions in the Middle East/Red Sea, I think prices would rise more markedly,"" she added.","['Iran', 'Middle East', 'Oil', 'Cost of living', 'Inflation', 'Fuel']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B1A/production/_132281472_gettyimages-1447983038.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/31AE/production/_132281721_iran-tanker-reuters.jpg']","['Sam Gruet', 'Katy Austin']",World,Middle East

A judge has already determined that Trump family members and executives fraudulently inflated assets to secure favourable loans. But the trial will determine damages. New York Judge Arthur Engoron has said he will issue a final written ruling in the case by the end of the month. The outcome could be stiff penalties that may challenge the famous family's legacy after it built its fortune in New York real estate. New York Attorney General Letitia James is asking the judge for a $370m (£290m) penalty. She also aims to bar Donald Trump from ever doing business in New York again, a five-year ban for Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr and an independent monitor to oversee their company for the next five years. Mr Trump's attorneys attempted to discredit Ms James's case, arguing during two hours of closing argument on Thursday that the family had not committed fraud. At the end, the former president interjected as well. After defence lawyer Christopher Kise requested that his client be allowed to speak, Mr Trump told the judge the trial was a ""a fraud on me"". Judge Engoron allowed Mr Trump to continue talking despite him refusing to abide by restrictions set by the judge. Mr Trump went on to insult Judge Engoron as well as Ms James. ""We have a situation where I'm an innocent man, I've been persecuted by someone running for office,"" Mr Trump said, before Judge Engoron told Mr Kise to ""control his client"". Mr Trump has made similar complaints during the three-month trial, both in his testimony before the court and in his speeches to reporters outside. He also brought up similar grievances when speaking to the press on three separate occasions during the hearing on Thursday. Repetition appeared to be a defence strategy at points. Mr Kise reiterated several arguments, including that the case was politically motivated and that Mr Trump's real estate valuations did not cause any harm to banks or anyone else. ""The marketplace functioned as it should,"" he said of Mr Trump's real estate dealings. He also claimed Judge Engoron's ruling would have wide-ranging consequences beyond the Trump family. ""This isn't just about President Trump,"" he said. ""What you do, judge, impacts every corporation in New York."" He also echoed previous testimony from Mr Trump and his two children, Donald Jr and Eric, who shifted blame to the accountants who they argued were in charge of preparing financial statements. Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka took the stand earlier in the trial, as well, although she is no longer a defendant in the case. Ms James' team disagreed and said the Trumps were attempting to shirk their responsibilities. In their own closing arguments on Thursday, they argued the onus was just as much on the Trump family to ensure financial statements were accurate as it was on their accountants. State attorney Andrew Amer claimed Mr Trump did not fake numbers himself but got employees and accountants to do his bidding to ""keep his net worth as high as possible"". The prosecution also showed a host of emails during the trial that suggested Trump family members were at least aware of Mr Trump's financial statements, despite testimony to the contrary. Before court, Ms James said these documents and other testimony during the 10-week trial had ""revealed the full scale and scope"" of Mr Trump's fraud. ""I am proud of the case we presented, and I am confident that the facts and the rule of law are on our side,"" she said. Many of the courtroom tensions over the past three months have centred on the New York judge, with Mr Trump's legal team claiming that Judge Engoron and his law clerk are biased against the former president. Mr Trump has also insulted Judge Engoron's clerk on social media, leading to a gag order from that cost him $15,000. Before court began on Thursday, court officials told reporters there had been a threat made on Judge Engoron's home on New York's Long Island. Local police later told US media that the threat was a ""swatting incident"", a hoax call made to send law enforcement to a home. The end of the fraud trial comes as several separate criminal cases against Mr Trump - including two sets of charges over his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election - are heating up. Another civil case, a second lawsuit from writer E Jean Carroll, is set to begin this month.","['Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump Jr', 'New York']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8CA8/production/_132280063_b6823500021e20931f06a51478ad78db4a4264e80_7_5797_32611000x563.jpg'],['Madeline Halpert'],World,US & Canada

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would examine whether Boeing failed to ensure its completed jets matched their approved design. The FAA had already grounded most of the 737 Max 9 fleet for inspection. The reviews after the emergency on the Alaska Airlines flight have uncovered issues such as loose bolts. ""This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again,"" the FAA said. ""Boeing's manufacturing practices need to comply with the high safety standards they're legally accountable to meet."" Boeing said it would ""cooperate full and transparently"" with the investigation. Company boss, Dave Calhoun, had previously described the problem as a ""quality escape"". It means the incident was caused by some failure in quality control in the plane, which had been in service for just eight weeks before the blowout. He told CNBC there were still questions that needed to be answered about how the incident was allowed to happen. ""What broke down in our gauntlet of inspections? What broke down in the original work that allowed for that escape to happen,"" he said. The door plug is a piece of fuselage, with a window, that fills the space where an emergency exit would be in certain configurations. The part broke off a Boeing 737 Max 9 jet that was operated by Alaska Airlines minutes after its take-off from Portland, Oregon on Friday. No serious injuries were reported after an emergency return to the airport but the FAA on Saturday grounded 171 planes that had the same door plug installed. It is unclear when the planes will be allowed to fly again. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has said the government would not be rushed into clearing the grounded planes, despite hundreds of flight cancellations. He said the aircraft ""need to be 100% safe"". ""The only consideration on the timeline is safety,"" he said. ""Until it is ready, it is not ready. Nobody can or should be rushed in that process."" Alaska Airlines has cancelled about 20% of its flights after 65 of its Max 9s were grounded. United Airlines, the other major US 737 MAX 9 operator, has 79 of the planes in its fleet out of action. It said it expects ""significant"" cancellations on Thursday after 167 flights did not go ahead on Wednesday. Alaska Airlines said it still needed revised inspection and maintenance instructions from Boeing, which must be approved by the FAA before it can begin flying the planes again. ""We will only return these aircraft to service when all findings have been fully resolved and meet all FAA and Alaska's stringent standards,"" the airline said. Both Alaska and United said on Monday they had found loose parts on a number of the grounded aircraft. The part which fell off was eventually found in a teacher's back garden without its four bolts. Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating what happened on the flight, said on Monday it was possible the bolts were missing from the start but they might have come off in the descent. The incident has revived scrutiny of Boeing, which has been trying to repair its reputation after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different version of the 737 Max plane killed 346 people. Its popular 737 Max planes were subsequently grounded globally for more than 18 months.

A fight erupted on Monday between police and community members who dug the tunnel after a cement truck arrived to fill it. Nine were arrested. Officials said the tunnel, which was 60ft long, was not properly reinforced. The city issued an emergency order to stabilise the structure on Wednesday. ""We have been on site in Crown Heights since [Tuesday] morning to investigate the illegal excavation work found underneath the buildings, and its impacts on the neighbouring structures,"" New York's Department of Buildings said. ""We will continue to monitor the progress of this emergency stabilization work,"" officials added, warning that additional action may be required. City inspectors were called to the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters in Brooklyn on Monday to conduct an emergency structural inspection under concerns that the illegal tunnel could have caused damage to the famous property. A brawl then ensued between police and some men inside the synagogue resisting the effort. They were charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and obstructing governmental administration. The tunnels were built under a prominent street in Brooklyn, where the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters are located. The building is one of the most significant Jewish sites in the city. The building, which sees thousands of visitors each year, was formerly the home of the leader of the Orthodox Jewish movement - Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The rabbi is credited with leading the Chabad-Lubavitch and revitalising the Hasidic religious community after it was devastated in the Holocaust. He died in 1994, but his headquarters remains a well-known centre for the Jewish religion. It is unclear who built the tunnel, how they did it and what their motivations were. It appears the tunnel connects to at least one other building on the street in Brooklyn. But a spokesperson for the Chabad blamed the incident on a ""group of extremist students"". And Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, the chairman of the Chabad, thanked police for their efforts and said the community was ""pained by the vandalism of a group of young agitators"". ""These odious actions will be investigated, and the sanctity of the synagogue will be restored,"" he said. One local told the New York Times that the men sought to build the tunnel to hasten the expansion of the synagogue. Some members who have attended services and functions at the Chabad have reportedly complained about overcrowding in the building in recent years.",['New York City'],['N/A'],['Brandon Drenon'],World,US & Canada

It comes just over a week after its president, Claudine Gay, resigned in part over her handling of antisemitism. Harvard has not yet commented on the lawsuit. The complaint, filed on Wednesday night, argues that Jewish students have been ""subjected to a severe and pervasive antisemitic hostile educational environment"" that have worsened since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel. It claims that Harvard students and faculty members have harassed, intimidated and assaulted Jewish students in classrooms, in on-campus activities and on social media, including by calling for the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel. ""What is most striking about all of this is Harvard's abject failure and refusal to lift a finger to stop and deter this outrageous antisemitic conduct and penalize the students and faculty who perpetrate it,"" the complaint states. The claimants - a student at Harvard Divinity School and a group called Students Against Antisemitism, which include students at Harvard's law and public health schools - allege that antisemitism on campus ""manifests itself in a double standard"". Harvard, they say, ""selectively enforces its policies to avoid protecting Jewish students from harassment, hires professors who support anti-Jewish violence and spread antisemitic propaganda, and ignores Jewish students' pleas for protection"", while disciplining those who engage in racism, transphobia and other forms of discrimination. The complaint seeks monetary damages and an injunction to stop Harvard's alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars those who receive federal funds from allowing discrimination based on race. The court filing was made by the Kasowitz Benson Torres law firm, which has launched similar lawsuits at New York University and the University of Pennsylvania. Harvard has been under fire in the months since the Hamas attack, with the US education department and the House of Representatives both opening investigations into its handling of antisemitism on campus. Last week, Claudine Gay - the university's first black president - resigned following criticisms of her response to anti-semitism on campus, and allegations that she plagiarised parts of her academic work. She faced a firestorm of criticism over her December testimony before Congress, in which she failed to explicitly say that calls for the genocide of Jews violated university policy.","['United States', 'Antisemitism', 'Israel-Gaza war']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B174/production/_132282454_gettyimages-1745646211.jpg'],['Sam Cabral'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67929679,Hunter Biden pleads not guilty to federal tax charges,"US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, has pleaded not guilty to tax offences in a California federal court.",2024-01-11,"US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, has pleaded not guilty to tax offences in a California federal court. He was indicted last month on nine criminal counts, including for failing to pay his taxes on time from 2016 to 2019, filing false tax returns in 2018 and tax evasion. If convicted on these charges, Mr Biden could face up to 17 years in prison. He is also facing separate federal charges over gun offences, to which he has already pleaded not guilty. Mr Biden, 53, made his first appearance in the tax case at a downtown Los Angeles courtroom on Thursday afternoon, sitting solemnly at the defence desk and standing as his lawyer Abbe Lowell entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. The father of four agreed to be released without detention on several conditions, including that he cannot drink, consume drugs, maintain employment or buy guns. If he violates the terms of his release, the judge warned there would be an arrest warrant out for the president's son and he may be imprisoned. The hearing drew a large gathering of the press to the courthouse, with US Secret Service officers doing a security sweep of the building and a nearby protester repeatedly shouting ""Hunter's laptop"" into a loudspeaker. Thursday's arraignment is the latest development in a five-year investigation by federal prosecutors into Mr Biden's finances. Over the summer, the president's son was close to a plea deal. Investigators were also ready to agree that a gun charge against him would be dropped in two years if he stayed out of legal trouble. But the agreement collapsed under scrutiny from a judge. As a result, Mr Biden was indicted in Delaware in September on three charges related to his illegal purchase of a firearm in 2018, while he was battling substance abuse. According to the 56-page tax related charges filed against Mr Biden in December, he made more than $7m (£5.5m) in gross income between 2016 and 2020 from business dealings in Ukraine, and related to connections from Romania and China. Prosecutors say Mr Biden ""wilfully"" failed to either pay or file his taxes to the Internal Revenue Service from 2016 to 2019, instead spending his money on personal extravagances. ""Between 2016 and Oct 15, 2020, the defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes,"" the document states. The charges span a period when Mr Biden was addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine. He wrote about it extensively in his memoir, Beautiful Things, saying he had used substances to cope with the grief of losing his older brother Beau to brain cancer in 2015. Since then, Mr Biden says he has become sober. He has also paid off all his tax debts, including penalties and interest, largely with the help of loans from Kevin Morris, a close friend and LA-based entertainment attorney.","['United States', 'Hunter Biden', 'Joe Biden', 'US politics']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/402C/production/_132282461_gettyimages-1915020320.jpg'],"['Sam Cabral', 'Samantha Granville']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67940747,US inflation picks up more than expected in December,"Consumer prices in the US rose again in December, driven by higher costs for housing, dining out and car insurance.",2024-01-11,"Consumer prices in the US rose again in December, driven by higher costs for housing, dining out and car insurance. Inflation - which measures the rate at which prices are increasing - hit 3.4% over the year, the Labor Department said. It was up from 3.1% in November, accelerating more over the month than many analysts had expected. The figure is likely to keep the US central bank cautious about declaring victory in its fight against inflation. The US Federal Reserve has an inflation target of 2% and, until last summer, had been raising interest rates to cool price rises. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the latest inflation figures are ""not bad numbers, but they do show that disinflation progress is still slow and unlikely to be a straight line down"". Inflation in the world's largest economy has dropped sharply since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, when the war in Ukraine sent energy costs soaring. Despite the uptick in December, many analysts said they expected inflation to improve in the coming months. ""This is another [Consumer Price Index] report that shows inflation has moderated and will likely continue to decelerate,"" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard. But while price increases for goods have cooled, as supply bottlenecks from the pandemic clear, the report suggests that progress in other areas is proving more difficult, said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. Prices for car insurance were up 20% compared with December 2022 while rents climbed 6.5%, according to the US Labor Department. It said that grocery prices gained a modest 1.3%, which compares to a 5.2% rise in prices for people choosing to dine out. The cost of some food to eat at home soared, with steak up 11% over the year. Mr Coulton said the report suggested that hopes that the Federal Reserve will move quickly to begin cutting interest rates could prove premature. ""This will give the Fed grounds for caution and they are unlikely to cut rates as quickly as the markets currently expect,"" Mr Coulton said. For now, the improvement in the situation has largely failed to persuade the American public, which continues to report glum economic sentiment. Last year, high petrol prices prompted 28-year-old Harish Kunchala to halt his regular car journeys to see his brother. Mr Kunchala, who is pursuing a graduate degree in computer science in California, said he has since resumed visits to his sibling but still felt budgetary stress in other areas. , He and his roommates keep lists in their apartment trying to keep track of where to find the best prices for meat and other items.

Executives at eBay sent live spiders and cockroaches to Ina and David Steiner, according to court papers. The couple were targeted for producing a newsletter the employees disliked, prosecutors said. The filings said the couple had been left ""emotionally, psychologically, and physically"" terrorised. The US Attorney's Office in the District of Massachusetts said Jim Baugh, eBay's former senior director of safety and security, had targeted the couple for producing EcommerceBytes, a newsletter that the company's executives were unhappy with. Baugh and six associates led a campaign to intimidate the Steiners, the court papers say. The acts of intimidation included sending live insects, a foetal pig and a funeral wreath to the Steiners' home in Natick, Massachusetts. Baugh and his associates also installed a GPS tracking device on the couple's car and created posts on the website Craigslist inviting sexual encounters at their home, according to the filings. The employees in question were fired by eBay shortly after the incident. In 2021, employee Philip Cooke was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The following year, Baugh was sentenced to nearly five years. Baugh's lawyers said he faced pressure from former eBay CEO Devin Wenig to reign in the Steiners over their coverage of the company. Mr Wenig, who stepped down in 2019, has not been charged in the case and denies knowledge of the harassment campaign.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67942133,Republican debate: Five takeaways as Haley and DeSantis face off,"Republican presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley squared off in a tense debate on Wednesday, trading barbs just days before the Iowa caucuses.",2024-01-11,"Republican presidential candidates Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley squared off in a tense debate on Wednesday, trading barbs just days before the Iowa caucuses. Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the race for the party's 2024 nomination, once again chose not to attend and held a Fox News town hall event at the same time. Iowa is the first in the state-by-state contest to decide who in the Republican party will contest the general election, probably against Democratic President Joe Biden, in November. Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley, a long way behind Mr Trump in the Iowa polls, are hoping a strong second place finish in the state on Monday will breathe new life into their campaigns. Here's what we learned when they went head to head on the stage in Des Moines. Things got off to a heated start when the pair traded insults in their very first answers. Mr DeSantis, 45, began proceedings by calling his opponent ""another mealy-mouthed politician that tells you what she thinks you want to hear"". Ms Haley then shot back and took aim at what she called Mr DeSantis's repeated ""lies"". ""You're going to find out about a lot of Ron's lies,"" she said. There have been four Republican debates before this, but the one-on-one nature of this one, which was hosted by CNN at Drake University, resulted in far more direct attacks and testy exchanges. It seemed as though both were hoping to land a knockout blow before Republicans in Iowa kickstart the next phase of this race and pick their preferred presidential candidate on Monday. The theme of the night? Attack, attack attack. As the two candidates battled on stage, the former president was three miles (5km) away holding an event with his supporters. The question of his absence, and his lead in the polls, unsurprisingly came soon in the debate. Mr DeSantis accused the former president of ""running to pursue his issues"" and ignoring the needs of American families. He said Mr Trump spewed ""word vomit"" on social media and cast doubt on his ability to get through the legal battles he is facing. Ms Haley, for her part, once again said that she did not believe Mr Trump was ""the right president to go forward"". Both were more vocal in their criticism of him than in previous debates, taking aim at his handling of issues ranging from the pandemic to border security and relations with China. At his own event in Des Moines, Mr Trump also took aim at both candidates and touted the ""tremendous"" levels of support he has in Iowa. Additionally, his campaign sent out several emails during the rival debate, criticising Ms Haley and Mr DeSantis on a range of issues including Ms Haley's ""childish"" foreign policy positions and China and Mr DeSantis' ""lying record on Covid."" Border security and immigration came up repeatedly, a reflection of the polls that show it is a primary concern for Republican voters in Iowa and around the US. Mr DeSantis urged the crowd to ""not trust"" Ms Haley with immigration. ""That's like having the fox guard the henhouse,"" he said, pointing to earlier comments in which she referred to the term ""illegal aliens"" as ""disrespectful"". Ms Haley mostly struck a more nuanced tone on the subject, referring to the root causes of migration in Central and South America and touting her credentials as a former ambassador to the United Nations. She did, however, say undocumented migrants should be deported for ""cutting the line"". The war in Ukraine proved to be one of the most contentious issues of the night, and both candidates sparred with one another over their positions on the conflict. Ms Haley hit out at Mr DeSantis for initially backing US funds for Ukraine, and then later changing his position. ""Nobody knows what he believes,"" she said. ""Let me tell you why Ukraine should matter. This is a freedom loving country,"" she said, adding that it was a ""friend"" of America and that US support was about ""preventing war"". Mr DeSantis responded by saying the war needed to end, and ""people like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine's border than our southern border"". The clashes over Ukraine mirror a wider rift in the Republican Party, which has been split over US foreign policy and continued assistance to Ukraine. The audience of 200 or so at the venue in Des Moines was also far from raucous, but Mr DeSantis seemed to get the larger share of the applause. Some of his comments, including one moment where he described Ms Haley as having a problem with ""ballistic podiatry"" (in other words, shooting herself in the foot) prompted a good response in the room. That is perhaps unsurprising, as Iowa is widely seen as more favourable to him than other states such as New Hampshire, where the second Republican contest will take place and Nikki Haley is expected to perform better. Ms Haley did have some memorable moments herself, and received a loud cheer when she described the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021 as a ""terrible day"". Afterwards her campaign staff and supporters said they saw the event as a victory that will propel her going into the New Hampshire primary. ""Tonight was a success,"" Texas congressman Will Hurd told the BBC. ""More people were Googling Nikki Haley than Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump combined. Her momentum is continuing."" But in a room not far from the venue, at his separate town hall in front of a favourable crowd, Mr Trump experienced a stronger reaction. His supporters shouted ""we love you"" throughout the event and he shook hands for more than 10 minutes after it finished. If Mr DeSantis and Ms Haley are to seriously challenge the former president, they will need to tempt some of these Iowan voters away from him before Monday's critical caucuses.","['Ron DeSantis', 'Iowa', 'Nikki Haley', 'Donald Trump', 'US politics', 'US election 2024', 'United States', 'Republican Party']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14395/production/_132273828_gettyimages-1915747874.jpg'],['Bernd Debusmann'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67951433,Lloyd Austin: Pentagon to review handling of defence secretary's illness,The Pentagon's inspector general has said it will investigate the handling of Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin's secretive hospital visit last week.,2024-01-11,"The Pentagon's inspector general has said it will investigate the handling of Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin's secretive hospital visit last week. Mr Austin, 70, was placed in intensive care on 1 January after suffering complications from a late December surgery to treat prostate cancer. But senior defence officials and the White House did not even learn he was seriously ill until three days later. President Joe Biden has stood by his defence chief amid growing criticism. In a memo circulated on Wednesday, inspector general Robert Storch - whose agency is independent from the defence department - said his office will ""examine the roles, processes, procedures, responsibilities, and actions related to the Secretary of Defense's hospitalization"". The review, he said, will ""assess whether the DoD's policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications and the effective transition of authorities as may be warranted due to health-based or other unavailability of senior leadership"". It is the third probe to be launched in the aftermath of Mr Austin's health crisis, following a 30-day assessment ordered by the cabinet secretary's own office and a review conducted by the White House. In addition to its review, the White House has also sent a directive to all cabinet secretaries making clear that they must inform the White House when they are unable to perform their duties. National security spokesman John Kirby has said the president's ""number one focus"" is Mr Austin's recovery and that he has no plans of sacking him, but he conceded that the disclosure of his illness had been ""suboptimal"". Pentagon officials have struggled to explain why they failed to notify relevant people in the chain of command sooner about the gravity of Mr Austin's illness. One reason, they claimed, was that his chief of staff was sick with the flu. Congress and the American public were not informed about the hospital visit until 5 January, four days after Mr Austin had been admitted. And it was not until Tuesday that the Pentagon revealed his cancer diagnosis, including to the White House. Doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center said Mr Austin was suffering from a urinary tract infection that had led to a fluid build up in his abdomen and a backed up small intestine. The secretary has resumed his full duties but remains at Walter Reed, with the Pentagon not yet sharing a date for when he may be discharged. ''He will continue to consult with his doctors on what kind of care he needs in order to be released from the hospital at the appropriate time,"" Maj Gen Pat Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, told reporters on Thursday. Mr Ryder added that the defence chief ""continues to experience some discomfort"". In a statement on Saturday, Mr Austin said: ""I am very glad to be on the mend and look forward to returning to the Pentagon soon."" ""I recognise I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed,"" he added. ""I commit to doing better.""",['United States'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/391A/production/_132281641_gettyimages-1239317727.jpg'],['Sam Cabral'],World,US & Canada

""I am going to make sure that in no way do I enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again,"" the Trump ally-turned-critic said. The Republican had faced pressure to step aside and allow the party to unify around a viable challenger to Mr Trump. He did not endorse anyone as he bowed out of the race. But on a hot mic moments before he announced he was ending his bid, Mr Christie predicted that Nikki Haley, who has been gaining on Mr Trump in some polls, was ""going to get smoked, and you and I both know it"". ""She's not up to this,"" he added. He also said another rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, was ""petrified"". Mr Christie, 61, who nationally has been polling in the low single figures, said he was suspending his campaign at a town hall event in the US state of New Hampshire on Wednesday afternoon. He devoted much of his remarks to a plea to Republican voters to reject the former president, who he accused of ""putting himself before the people of this country"". ""Donald Trump wants you to be angry every day because he is angry,"" he added. His departure comes five days before the Iowa caucuses, the first of the state-by-state contests in which Republican voters will pick their preferred candidate for president. The eventual winner will be anointed the Republican nominee in July, before going on to challenge the Democratic nominee - likely Joe Biden - in the November general election. Mr Christie had been urged to drop out ahead of the second contest this month in New Hampshire, where some surveys indicate Ms Haley could be catching up with Mr Trump. The north-eastern state has a large faction of unaffiliated voters and has been known to deliver unpredictable results. Mr Christie has been polling at 12% there and many of his supporters may now back Ms Haley. In a statement, Ms Haley called Mr Christie ""a friend for many years"" and commended him ""on a hard-fought campaign"". But her opponents were quick to chime in on social media. Mr DeSantis said he agreed Ms Haley is ""going to get smoked"". Mr Trump said he ""might even get to like [Mr Christie] again"" following his ""very truthful statement"" about Ms Haley. The former president's political action committee said in a statement that he had ""already vanquished eight challengers before a single vote has been cast because Republican voters want a strong leader who will reboot our economy, secure our border, make America energy independent again, and keep our families safe"". This was Mr Christie's second unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination - he lost to Mr Trump in 2016. Mr Christie had hoped to act as an attack dog for a field of Trump rivals who dared not cross the Republican base, which remains deeply loyal to the former president. The strategy resulted in some zingers during the primary debates, but without Mr Trump on stage, Mr Christie failed to land any direct blows. Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist based in New Hampshire, said Mr Christie had faced up to political reality. ""Republican voters do not want to hear the same attacks that they've heard from Democrats or even the media for the better part of eight years,"" Mr Bartlett said.","['US election 2024', 'United States', 'Donald Trump', 'US politics']",['N/A'],['Kayla Epstein'],World,US & Canada

Flood warnings were in effect for parts of New York and New Jersey until Thursday. More than 150,000 households had no power on Wednesday evening, with New York state and Pennsylvania worst hit. Officials warned some rivers could still burst their banks in the next two days in parts of the north-east. The heavy rainfall has led to road closures and dozens of flood warnings in the region. Officials have urged people to move their cars away from rising rivers in New Jersey, as the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued multiple flood warnings in the state. ""Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads,"" the NWS said in an advisory on Wednesday, cautioning that ""most flood deaths occur in vehicles"". In Connecticut, officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents along the Yantic River on Wednesday due to flood risk, adding that people may be displaced for several days. And in Annapolis, Maryland, residents were forced to use kayaks to navigate through record floodwaters. Annapolis resident Kelsi Furman told the BBC's US news partner CBS that the water had risen beyond the city's seawall. ""Kind of alarming to see,"" she said. ""I didn't realise how crazy it gets."" Many school districts on the East Coast cancelled classes or opened later on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the weather. Nearly 700 flights were cancelled on Wednesday and almost 4,000 were delayed, with New York City's airports most affected. The NWS has warned that severe weather could return later this week as a storm lopes into the Great Lakes region over Friday and Saturday. This system, the agency said, will bring with it up to 4in (10cm) of snowfall from south-east Nebraska to Michigan. It will be coupled with a cold Arctic front, forecasters added, which may bring about strong blizzard conditions. A string of tornadoes rolled through several south-eastern US states on Tuesday, including Florida, Alabama and Georgia. Among the fatalities was an 81-year-old woman in Alabama who was reportedly killed after a tornado ripped through Houston County, destroying mobile homes and motorhomes. One person was killed and two others were critically injured in Claremont, North Carolina, officials said, after a powerful storm moved through a mobile home park. A motorist died in Clayton County, Georgia, officials said, after a tree fell across a highway and crushed the driver's car. And one man was crushed to death by a toppled tree in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday morning, the local station WVTM reported, citing local officials.

Her mother, Aziza Bennis, 58, was found with multiple stab wounds at her flat in Ealing, west London. Hanaa Bennis admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility and awaits sentencing. Prosecutor Ed Brown KC told the court at a hearing earlier that on 15 August 2022, police were called after screaming was heard from the mother's flat. Comments were heard including ""please stop hurting me"" and ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"", the court was told. Police forced their way into the home and found blood on the wall and floor, the court heard. The victim was found in the living room lying fatally wounded in a foetal position. The defendant had a deep cut above her left eye and a puncture wound to her right thigh, said Mr Brown. Hanna Bennis told police: ""My mother attacked me with a knife. I sustained multiple injuries on my body from my mother's actions. I acted in self-defence."" Earlier that day, the court heard, the pair had exchanged a series of text messages, with the defendant saying: ""You made me hate my life. U genuinely make me not want to live..."" Her mother replied: ""Get a life Hanaa"", to which the defendant responded: ""Burn in hell"" with an added offensive term. Mr Brown said: ""It is clear that the deceased was an alcoholic and the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that the deceased was violent towards her children."" He went on to say the defendant was ""disruptive"", ""rebellious"", ""drank to excess"" and ""often went missing"" - but added her behaviour was ""in large part the result of the abuse by her mother"". Bennis had denied murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, which was accepted by the prosecution. Referring to pre-sentencing psychiatric reports, Judge Nigel Lickley KC said: ""Both doctors agree there are a number of features I have got to consider but the overriding one is complex PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) as a result of childhood trauma."" Mitigating, Jeremy Dein KC told the court of a ""shocking"" history of abuse by Bennis's mother that involved beatings with sandals and belt buckles and black magic. She had been on a child protection register, in emergency residential accommodation, homeless, living in care and later with her grandmother. Judge Lickley adjourned sentencing to 18 January.

Merseyside Police said he fled the scene leaving mother-of-four Michelle Atherton, who died from her injuries. The 42-year-old was jailed for 16 years at Liverpool Crown Court for causing death by dangerous driving. Marsh, of Gaskell Street was also disqualified from driving for 18 years after he pleaded guilty on the second day of a trial. Det Sgt Kurt Timpson said the sentence would act as ""a stark message to anyone whose selfish and reckless actions end in such tragedy"".

Ms Atherton, 47, suffered serious injuries and died in hospital shortly after the crash, while Marsh left the scene on foot but was later found and arrested. Det Sgt Timpson said Marsh was ""impaired through drink and drugs"" and he was driving ""vastly in excess of the speed limit"" before the crash. The lives of Ms Atherton's family have been ""changed forever by this incident"", he added. In a tribute released after her death last year, her family described her as ""the best mum that anyone could have ever dreamt or wished for"" who was ""taken from us too soon"".

Confusion at the Old Bailey arose when the jury forewoman stated they were not guilty, but later admitted she had meant to say no verdict had been reached. The men, accused of murdering Adrian Keise near Waterloo station, remain in custody a day after the error was made. Their defence barrister now fears his clients are being held illegally. The trial of the three accused men had been expected to conclude on Wednesday, but the jury has remained unable to reach a verdict. The prosecution has now been given seven days to consider whether or not to seek a retrial in the case. Defence barrister Kerim Fuad KC says he is ""extremely troubled"" by what happened. The family of 32-year-old Mr Keise, who was fatally injured in the early hours of 29 October 2022, left court tearful and shaken. Brothers Paul and Matthew Yusuff and their friend Moussa Traore, all from south London, are charged with murder. The jury of 11 men and women had deliberated for 10 hours and 46 minutes, before being called back into court for what was expected to be a majority verdict. The forewoman was twice asked by the court if verdicts had been reached on which they all agreed, before she stated the defendants, from south London, were not guilty. Soon after the jury was discharged however, Judge Charles Gratwicke received a note indicating a mistake had been made, forcing him to reassemble the court. The judge questioned the forewoman about what happened and she admitted her mistake in saying the jury had reached a unanimous verdict when it had not. The judge then told jurors he would accept a verdict on which at least 10 agreed and told them to resume deliberations. But the jury was discharged for a second time after deliberating for a total of 12 hours and 44 minutes, having still been unable to reach a verdict. Judge Gratwicke was told they had been unable to agree on verdicts in relation to murder and manslaughter. They had, however, reached a unanimous verdict that Paul Yusuff was not guilty of possessing a blade or point - a charge the other two men still also face. Mr Fuad has now expressed concern that his clients could now be being detained illegally. The defendants deny all the charges against them. Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The body of Muriel McKay, who was kidnapped in 1969, is believed to be buried on the farm in Hertfordshire. Her family offered the money in exchange for access to Stocking Farm for a ""small, targeted"" search. The landowner said he ""very much sympathises"" with the family. ""All I want is to pick up my grandmother's remains,"" said Ms McKay's grandson Mark Dyer. Ms Mckay was the wife of Mr Murdoch's deputy Alick McKay - not Mr Murdoch - and she was held ransom for £1m. Brothers Arthur and Nizamodeen Hosein were convicted for the kidnap and murder, but while Arthur died in prison in 2009, Nizamodeen is still alive in Trinidad and Tobago where he was deported to after serving his sentence. Hosein recently admitted to hiding her body on the farm near Bishop's Stortford, although has claimed she died of a heart attack. The family say he is willing to return to the UK to show the exact spot where the body lies. But they say the current owner of the farm has refused access, and also claim the Metropolitan Police are being ""completely unhelpful"". Mr Dyer described the situation as ""absurd"". ""Nizam Hosein said she's wrapped in a coat and hidden somewhere by the barn,"" he said. ""Isn't that chilling?"" The Metropolitan Police searched Stocking Farm in March 2022 but found nothing. In their letter to farm owner Ian de Burgh Marsh, the family wrote: ""We agreed to a limited search previously and now the circumstances have changed as we have specific information as to the burial location from the person who actually dug the grave."" A statement sent to the BBC on behalf of Mr Marsh said he ""very much sympathises with the family and hopes they can find closure over this tragedy"". ""Mr Marsh is in regular conversation with the Metropolitan Police over this matter. He has at all times been fully cooperative with their investigation and every time the police have asked for access to his land, he has granted it to them,"" the statement said. The Met Police said it carried out an ""extensive search"" in 2022 with the landowner's consent. It said a number of experts were involved including forensic archaeologists and anthropologists, using radar to identify any ""anomalies"" below the earth. ""We understand how frustrating and difficult this matter has been for Muriel's family and remain in contact with them,"" a spokesperson said. Mr Dyer was six years old when his grandmother was kidnapped and has fond memories of her. ""I made a promise to Alick McKay that I would find her one day. I've got to give this everything. I'm going to get her for my mother, my uncle, and my family - and for me."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Amanda and Norman Barber, from Warrington, lost their business and home and are living in a caravan after their wrongful convictions in 2012. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government would bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate"" victims. ""It's good news, but obviously it's a bit late,"" said Mrs Barber. ""It should have happened years ago, it shouldn't bring a TV programme to bring it to people's minds."" Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, based on faulty information from Horizon, a piece of accounting software that indicated money had gone missing. Many maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues with the Post Office. Some went to prison for false accounting and theft, while others have been financially ruined, took their own lives or died before their names were cleared. ""It ruined our lives,"" Mrs Barber said. ""We lost the house, we lost the business, we lost family. They stop talking to us when this happened. ""We lost everything. Now we live in a caravan. We couldn't get a mortgage. Luckily, we didn't go bankrupt because my daughter lent us some money."" After 20 years, campaigners won a legal battle to have their cases reconsidered. To date, only 93 people have had their convictions quashed. A public inquiry is ongoing but Mr Bates vs The Post Office - an ITV drama broadcast earlier this month - thrust the issue back into the spotlight. Mrs Barber was a sub-postmistress in Warrington while her husband worked at Manchester Airport, but occasionally worked part-time at the branch. She said one morning, she had an unexpected visit from two auditors. ""They asked us, 'Did we know if there was any shortages?' which we did, because we kept phoning the helplines, telling them we were short over the previous two years,"" she said. ""Before they even counted the cash, they got my area manager to ring me and they suspended me. ""I wasn't allowed in the office, they took the keys before they even went into the office."" Over the previous two years, the couple used £200,000 of their money to plug the shortfall. They pleaded guilty after being told they were the ""only ones that this had happened to"". ""It was only seeing the Panorama documentary on telly about four years ago that we realised there were other people [affected],"" Mrs Barber added. While their convictions were overturned in 2021, the couple are still picking up the pieces. ""It's still affecting us,"" Mr Barber said. ""We've stuck together through it all. ""We had community service. We had never broken the law in our lives and we were stuck on a bus to pick up litter up and down the main road. It's devastating."" Mrs Barber said the couple were now taking each day as it comes following the latest government announcements. ""It's brought it all back to life again. But we are just living day by day and we want to get back to how we were living 15 years ago, in a house and back to normal life."" A Post Office spokesperson previously said: ""We share fully the aims of the public inquiry to get to the truth of what went wrong in the past and establish accountability. ""It's for the inquiry to reach its own independent conclusions after consideration of all the evidence on the issues that it is examining. ""We are doing all we can to put right the wrongs of the past."" Have you been personally affected by the Post Office scandal? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Reading Jail formally closed in January 2014 and has been empty ever since. A campaign to turn the Grade II listed building into an arts and community centre was supported by celebrities including Stephen Fry, Kate Winslet and Dame Judi Dench. The government said the jail had been sold to the Ziran Education Foundation. It said the charity's plans for the site included an educational centre incorporating a museum and exhibition space. Oscar Wilde spent two years at the jail after being convicted in 1895 of gross indecency - effectively for being gay. He spent the last three years of his life in exile in France, where he composed his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, describing an execution at the prison. In 2021, a portrait by the celebrated street artist Banksy appeared on a prison wall. The image showed a prisoner escaping on a rope made of bedsheets tied to a typewriter. The artist later offered to support the campaign to create an arts hub at the site by selling the stencil he had used in order to match the jail's £10m asking price. In a statement, the MoJ said: ""The sale follows an extensive bidding and vetting process to guarantee best value for taxpayers' money while ensuring future planning applications acknowledge the historic nature of the site. ""The Ziran Education Foundation will now engage with Reading Borough Council on the use of the site as it will need to approve any development plans. ""Initial proposals included plans for an educational centre providing services to the local community, including a museum outlining the history of the prison and an exhibition space accessible to the public.""

The Conservative peer admitted the four charges, between April and August 2023. The former environment minister also faces three other driving offences, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. On 27 April, Lord Goldsmith was caught travelling along Chelsea Embankment at 29mph, despite the limit being 20mph, according to court papers. Just over a month later, on 31 May, he drove at 46mph on the A316 in Twickenham, which has a 40mph limit. He was caught speeding on that same road on 3 August, while driving at 47mph. A month before the August incident, on 18 July, Lord Goldsmith exceeded the 20mph limit on Bayswater Road, next to Kensington Gardens, while travelling at 28mph. District Judge Nina Tempia imposed an interim disqualification, banning him from driving until his sentencing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 18 March. Lord Goldsmith, who unsuccessfully ran to be London Mayor in 2016 before serving as a minister in Boris Johnson's cabinet, did not attend the hearing.

Gail Ward, from Wells in Somerset, was taken to court, convicted and sentenced to community service. She was one of hundreds of people wrongly prosecuted after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from accounts. ""People keep saying it's the Horizon scandal, but Horizon is a computer system,"" she said. ""Horizon didn't summons me. Horizon didn't ruin my life - that was people, people did that to people, and they knew they were doing it."" Mrs Ward ran the former post office on Priory Road in Wells for five years and remembers the day investigators came into her shop. ""They arrived at 08:30 in the morning, they came into our shop and I thought they would help us correct the wrong. They didn't,"" she said. ""Personally I think they knew there was a problem being reported elsewhere, but you were made to feel guilty and like a criminal straight away. ""I was there talking to them for three or four hours and they just kept saying 'where's the money, what have you bought' and I just replied 'I've done nothing wrong'."" An inquiry into the scandal, which started in February 2021, earlier heard from ex-investigator Stephen Bradshaw who  denied that 'Mafia' style behaviour was used towards wrongly accused sub-postmasters. After being accused of stealing £12,000 Mrs Ward managed to save up and paid all the money in full out of her own pocket, but she was still convicted and sentenced to community service. ""I'll never forgive the Post Office, no matter how much compensation or when my conviction is quashed,"" she said. The day before she was summoned to court, her solicitor called her to tell her to pack a bag in case she was sent to prison. The morning of the court hearing she said goodbye to her 13-year-old son. ""It was horrendous. He went to school that morning not knowing if one of his parents would be there when he came home,"" Mrs Ward said. Mrs Ward was sentenced to 150 hours of community service and ordered to clean trains at Cranmore Station. ""We'd be taken away on a minibus, all of us convicts, and I'd say I hadn't done anything wrong - people just wouldn't believe me,"" she said. ""When we arrived at the train station, we'd have our tasks and have to clean the area and you weren't allowed to talk to anyone. It was a horrific time.

Harjinder Butoy, of Derbyshire, served an 18-month term, prompting his Post Office branch to be shut down. Mr Butoy, who says his life was destroyed, said ""somebody needs to be prosecuted"". The Post Office said it was ""acutely aware of the human cost... and are doing all we can to right the wrongs"". A total of 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 based on information from Horizon, a computer system that erroneously indicated money was missing from branch accounts. Mr Butoy, who ran the post office in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire with his wife for five years, said when he was in jail ""all I kept thinking was, 'How I am going to clear my name?' ""I used to wake up every day in prison thinking, 'What am I doing here? I shouldn't be here'."" He added: ""I've always said it, somebody needs to be prosecuted - take their livelihood away, the way they took it from us. ""I am very angry about it. They destroyed me. I have nothing left. They even made me go bankrupt. They knew there were problems with Horizon but they kept hiding it from everybody."" ""I have lost all my confidence... I still feel embarrassed about it even though I have cleared my name. I shouldn't have been in this situation in the first place. I wake up every day thinking about it."" Mr Butoy, from Chesterfield, was sentenced to three years and three months in prison after his conviction for 11 counts of theft in 2007, but served 18 months before he was released. His conviction was finally overturned by the Court of Appeal in April 2021. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry began in February 2021, with victims still seeking appropriate redress and accountability. The scandal has been brought into the spotlight recently by the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the government will bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. Mr Butoy added: ""The ITV drama is amazing. I can't believe it has taken the ITV drama to come out for the government to make a move and do all the things they were saying."" Mr Sunak also announced on Wednesday that the 555 former postmasters who brought a group lawsuit will be offered an upfront payment of £75,000. But Mr Butoy said: ""The compensation is nowhere near enough. It is a bit disgusting what the government is doing."" A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We fully share the aims of the current public inquiry, set up to establish what went wrong in the past and the accountability for it. ""Both Post Office and government are committed to providing full, fair and final compensation for the people affected. ""To date, offers of compensation totalling more than £138m have been made to around 2,700 postmasters, the majority of which have been agreed and paid.""

ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, starring Toby Jones, has sparked renewed debate over the scandal. Hannah Watkins, from Louth, said some people were showing their support by offering to boycott the service. However, she said the vast majority of businesses were franchised and relied on income from customers. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing. Many maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised concerns about problems with the software. However, some went to prison for false accounting and theft and many were financially ruined. Speaking to BBC Radio Lincolnshire, Ms Watkins, who has worked at the post office in Louth for about 18 years, said: ""It's all anyone is talking about at the minute. ""I'm in a couple of Facebook groups for sub-postmasters, and the general feeling across the network is customers are saying they are not going to use the post office any more. ""It's not against the staff, or anything like that, it's against the Post Office as an organisation."" However, she said: ""Whilst I understand the depth of feeling from the public, and obviously have the utmost sympathy for the victims, I would like to appeal to the public to continue to support their local post offices. ""Most offices are franchised, so boycotting them only hurts the sub-postmaster, not the Post Office itself. ""It would be completely detrimental,"" she added. A public inquiry began in February 2021, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons on Wednesday that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. The Post Office previously said the public inquiry aims to get to ""the truth of what went wrong"" and added it would be inappropriate to comment on any police investigation. A spokesperson for Fujitsu, the tech company that developed the Horizon system, said it recognises the ""devastating impact on postmasters' lives and that of their families"" and has ""apologised for its role in their suffering"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-67947095,Measles cases in West Midlands highest since 1990s,"The number of people with measles in the West Midlands is at its highest since at least the mid-1990s, health officials say.",2024-01-11,"The number of people with measles in the West Midlands is at its highest since at least the mid-1990s, health officials say. Figures show the area had 133 cases since 1 October, the highest number since the two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab was rolled out. There were also 96 ""likely"" cases in the same time period, data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows. In England, there were 167 confirmed cases between January and October 2023. The main symptoms of measles include a high fever, sore and red watery eyes, coughing, sneezing and a rash that usually appears after initial symptoms. Dr Naveed Syed, health protection consultant at the UKHSA, said outbreaks of measles across the region were an ""increasing problem"". ""At the moment, we are seeing quite a number of outbreaks of measles unfortunately, throughout the West Midlands,"" he told the BBC. ""It's mainly concentrated in the Birmingham area, but we do have cases in the Coventry area."" Parts of Birmingham and the Black Country have among the lowest vaccination rates in the UK. Dr Syed said ""fewer and fewer people"" were receiving immunisations due to ""various communities"" holding ""various beliefs around measles"". ""There are some Muslim communities who have concerns around the MMR, because one of the MMR vaccines does have ingredients derived from pork,"" he said. ""However there are other vaccines available, that do not have any pork or pork derivate ingredients in them, which are perfectly safe to be given."" He urged people to book in with GPs if they had not had two doses of the vaccine. Measles vaccinations were introduced in the UK in 1968 and are estimated to have prevented 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths. The MMR jab, introduced in 1996, is part of the routine NHS schedule of childhood vaccines. It is given in two doses, the first before age two and the second before age five. Dr Syed said the vaccine was ""safe and effective"" and would give ""90 to 95% protection"" against developing symptoms of measles. ""So at least one vaccine is essential - and preferably two, because that gives nearly 100% of protection against diseases like measles,"" he explained. ""The more people that get the vaccine, the better it is for the whole community as then we protect everyone."" The Frederick Bird Academy, in Coventry, has been holding measles vaccination clinics after two of its pupils were taken to hospital with the disease. Both pupils fully recovered, but Amy Husband, school improvement partner, said public health officials had recommended the primary school ran a catch-up vaccination programme, following the recent outbreak. She described the response as ""really positive"" for pupils, staff, parents and the wider community. ""We ran that vaccination clinic, and we went from around 40% vaccination to around just under 80% vaccination,"" she said. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-67949045,"Tan Hill Inn: Gun victim 'very lucky' to avoid more wounds, court told","A man shot in the arm during a row at Britain's highest pub was ""very lucky indeed"" to avoid further injury, a court heard.",2024-01-11,"A man shot in the arm during a row at Britain's highest pub was ""very lucky indeed"" to avoid further injury, a court heard. Lee Jackson was fired at a number of times during the disturbance at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire on 21 July. The argument began when Richard Bowser got into in a brawl at the pub, near Reeth, after his bank card was declined. Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. On Thursday, the trial at Teesside Crown Court heard from firearms expert Andre Horne, who said there was evidence of shotgun fire at the scene, as well as four bullets being fired from a recommissioned revolver. The revolver had been fitted with a replacement barrel, Mr Horne said, which affected the ""velocity"" of the bullets when they were fired. One of the projectiles became lodged in Mr Jackson's arm when he was shot at through a door, but two others hit him on the chest and abdomen respectively and caused bruising. Discussing the bullet which struck Mr Jackson's chest, Mr Horne said he was ""very lucky indeed that the bullet [had] lost sufficient velocity to only cause him an abrasion."" A fourth bullet fired through the door hit a wall opposite at ""shoulder-height"", Mr Horne said. The jury was told Mr Bowser was found with 44 bullets in his pockets when he was arrested by police. The guns were later recovered from a bed in the nearby glamping pod where he was staying the night. Defending Bowser, Alistair MacDonald KC said previous evidence in which Mr Jackson claimed the accused had said ""goodnight sweetheart"" before firing a gun pointed at his head was not true. He told the court Mr Jackson had not mentioned it in an initial interview with police in hospital on the day after the incident. ""I suggest something like 'goodnight sweetheart' as he pulled the trigger would have been something that stuck firmly in your mind,"" he added. Mr Jackson said ""bits of the event have come back to me, maybe"" throughout therapy he had been undergoing. Mr Bowser has previously pleaded guilty to assaulting three people and possession of a firearm, but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder.

It escaped from Reddish Vale Farm in Stockport and staff believe it has made its way to Reddish Vale Country Park. Farm manager Jordan Beckwith said the meerkat, one of three males, may have gone looking for food or a mate. He said while the meerkats at the farm were ""very friendly"" he urged people not to approach it if they see it as the animal ""can bite if feeling threatened"". ""We've been searching the county park this morning and all round the visitor centre, and it's absolutely nowhere to be seen,"" Mr Beckwith said. ""We've been looking for him in the burrows and we've had the meerkat barking sound on and put out food to try and entice him back."" The animal is thought to have escaped through a drain hole during maintenance work before it passed through a fence and on to the park. In a Facebook post the farm said: ""One of our meerkats has escaped overnight. We believe he may have made his way on to Reddish Vale Country Park. If you spot him please do not approach, our meerkats are very friendly but can bite if feeling threatened."" Adding: ""Please share so we can get him back home safe."" An infrared drone camera will be used to try and locate the animal as the search continues overnight, Mr Beckwith said.

In 2022 South Kesteven District Council announced the closure was permanent, saying it could not afford the quoted £10.5m to repair the building.The Deepings Community Leisure Centre Community Interest Company (CIC) was created to try to save it.The CIC is asking for a one-off grant of £850,000 from the council and intends to raise the rest of the £2.2m from other sources including parish councils, a local charity and Lincolnshire County Council.Earlier this week, South Kesteven District Council deputy leader and member for Deeping St James, Cllr Ashley Baxter, told fellow councillors that they ""can be heroes with this, if they take it forward and enable it to happen"".“I am confident that there will be a big take-up from day one,” he told an extraordinary meeting of South Kesteven's finance and culture and leisure overview and scrutiny committees.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-67932455,Surrey floods: Evacuations made as damage continues,People and premises in Surrey have been evacuated after floods hit some parts of the county.,2024-01-11,"People and premises in Surrey have been evacuated after floods hit some parts of the county. Lloyd Hatton, flood response lead at Surrey Fire and Rescue Service, said 50 to 100 people had been evacuated from Addlestone and over 150 people led to safety in Chertsey since Sunday. Residents have seen water levels start to fall after four days of flooding. Warnings remain in place but the risk is currently very low, according to the Environment Agency. In the early hours of Monday, 32 people were also evacuated from Abbeyfields mobile home park in Thameside, Chertsey, on the banks of the river. Tim Oliver, leader of Surrey County Council (SCC), said dozens of firefighters were helping to deal with flooding incidents following heavy rain and Storm Henk. He said people had been evacuated from homes and a business in impacted areas. People had been trapped in cars and boats, he added. Mr Oliver said SCC was supporting the Environment Agency, Surrey Police and local district and borough councils to assist residents and businesses affected. He added river levels will continue to be monitored. Traveller Sol Smith said a group of 20 caravans had to leave their pitch at a site behind Abbeyfields mobile home park on Saturday night. He said the river burst its banks near the M3 and flooded nearby fields and lakes before it reached the travellers. He said Spelthorne council had warned the group about the floods three days earlier, but had not told them where to go. ""We are 20 caravans and each one has a family with about two or three children, some of them have four or five,"" he said. ""We can't be on a road. We're at Sheep Walk. We're still there now and vehicles are still trying to cut through."" By Wednesday, a landowner had offered a site off the road, but Mr Smith said the council and the landowner were still trying to resolve ""red tape"". He also said the council had provided four toilets and a friend had provided another, but there were not enough. A Surrey County Council spokesperson said: ""We can confirm we are supporting approximately 120 people and 25 caravans who had to move from Littleton Lane Community due to recent flooding. ""We are working alongside Spelthorne Borough Council to address their needs whilst we do all we can to find an alternate temporary site within the local area. Together we'll continue to assist in order to ensure they are safe and well, until they are able to return."" Mr Hatton said firefighters had returned to Chertsey and Addlestone to help those who had lost power or who had welfare issues. Four dedicated rest centres also opened in the area, he told BBC Radio Surrey. He warned people not to drive or walk through flood water. ""You can't see through this water. You've got broken drains. You've got debris. There's lots of hidden dangers,"" he said. On Tuesday, families put on waders to walk through water flooding the A308. Almost the whole of the Thames in Surrey has been subject to warnings, affecting areas including Chertsey, Walton, Sunbury, Molesey and Egham. Runnymede councillor Sam Jenkins said: ""The water levels on the Thames seem to be stabilising, but the fallout for Runnymede isn't over yet. Some properties are still at significant risk."" Surrey County Council previously said it was working with the Environment Agency and borough councils to deliver a flood relief plan,  known as the River Thames Scheme. A six-week statutory consultation will run from 22 January to 4 March with public meetings in Egham, Chertsey, Shepperton, Molesey, Walton-on-Thames, Sunbury, Staines and Thorpe. The Environment Agency said floods were on a par with those in 2003 but not expected to reach levels seen in 2014. One Staines resident described the floods as a ""repeat performance"" of 2014. Angeli Gyani, whose house near the Runnymede Pleasure Ground was marooned in waist-deep water, said there had been comparisons between the water levels of 2014 but no-one had looked at the speed. ""It came in so fast,"" she said. ""It was coming up much faster this year, faster than in 2014, which is critical. Knowing the speed of it allows you to prepare."" She said her husband David Mason had been monitoring data and had heard from the Environment Agency several flood gauges had become unresponsive, probably due to water ingress. She said that gauges at Bell Weir in Old Windsor had been unresponsive since Monday evening. The Environment Agency confirmed the gauges at Bell Weir Lock were currently not transmitting data. A spokesman for the agency said: ""When the flood water has reduced and we are able to safely access the gauges we will fix the assets. This does not affect our ability to monitor and predict flood risk, as the gauges at Bell Weir are part of a much larger network which provide a picture across the whole Thames and its tributaries.""

River levels began rising across Oxfordshire in the wake of Storm Henk and further heavy rain last week. Businesses and residents said flooding was still causing problems. Oxford City Council said it was ""working tirelessly"" with its partner agencies to clear the water. It said Oxford Direct Services (ODS) had installed about 106m of flood protection at Bullstake Close and was pumping water to protect properties and to keep the Botley Road open. ""Over four million (4,320,000) litres of water have been pumped every 24-hour period at Bullstake Close alone,"" the authority said in a statement. ""Over 4,000 sandbags have been distributed to vulnerable people and households at risk of flooding. ""In addition, around 4,000 sandbags and 40 tonnes of sand (equivalent to 90 grand pianos) have been made available at Redbridge Park and Ride's self-serve sandbag station."" It comes after businesses and residents in the city complained of being ""cut off"" because of the floods. Abingdon Road - a main route into the city - has partially reopened four days after being shut. And some homes in the area suffered from a loss of electricity and water, as well as sewage problems. In its statement, the city council continued: ""With water levels starting to recede, the next stage is recovery, and the council will be continuing to work closely with partners to ensure both effective mopping up of the detritus left from flooding, as will be considering any further lessons on Oxford's response to the flooding. ""The council is also in discussion with government and liaising with the neighbouring local  authorities to see if the government's flooding financial assistance scheme may be applied in Oxfordshire."" Councillor Nigel Chapman, cabinet member for citizen focused services and council companies at Oxford City Council, added: ""I want to offer my thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worked to address the flooding in Oxford over the past few days and has helped to keep people, homes, and businesses safe. ""However, Oxford City Council is committed to tackling flooding as it happens, and the strongest measure is prevention through flood alleviation schemes such as the Northway and Marston scheme, and the proposed Oxford Flood Alleviation Scheme.

That would represent a loosening of the requirements for a number of its courses, which theoretically need straight A grades for applicants to be accepted.

Prosecuting, Roger Smart said Sokol Rranci, of St Anne’s Drive, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, had paid for a Greek national to fly to the UK in September 2021.The man, who cannot be named, believed he was being given a job in a Greek restaurant in Sheffield.Instead, he was taken to Amarildo Rranci’s home in Langsett Road, Sheffield, and 11 days later was transferred to another property at Queens Court, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, Mr Smart said.Here, he saw cannabis growing in a bedroom, the court heard.Mr Smart said the defendants hit him, asked him to hand over his mobile telephone and threatened him with a pair of scissors, saying they would cut his ears off.They made him telephone his family and demanded money from them, threatening to kill him, jurors were told.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cmmddvjm9lgo,"Relatives can't sue medics for distress, court says",N/A,2024-01-11,"Families cannot seek damages for the psychological impact of seeing a loved one die in cases of potential medical negligence, a court has ruled. It comes after the Supreme Court decided three families did not have a case after witnessing the traumatic loss of relatives led them to sue for damages. The court was told claimants had said suffered ""psychiatric illnesses"" that were triggered by a relative's death and their subsequent treatment. But judges ruled six to one in favour of dismissing the families' appeal. Each family alleged the traumatic deaths were caused by doctors failing to diagnose and treat a life-threatening condition. But in May, the Court of Appeal dismissed claims, which were brought against the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust and an individual, Dr Mahmud Ahmed. Judges stated that while witnessing a loved one's death would likely be a disturbing event, it was not the role of doctors to try to prevent family members having such a reaction. One case was brought by the daughters of Parminder Singh Paul, who died after suffering a cardiac arrest in the street in 2014.His daughters, then aged nine and 12, had witnessed the event and saw paramedics in Wolverhampton performing CPR on their father. Another case was brought by Lynette and Mark Polmear, the parents of Esmee Polmear, who died aged six from the effects of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Both parents, who were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, took legal action against the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust after witnessing her death, in July 2015.The trust had previously admitted doctors should have diagnosed Esmee's condition when she was taken to hospital with breathing difficulties, in December 2014. A third case was launched against then Dudley-based Dr Mahmud Ahmed by Tara Purchase. The mother of 20-year-old Evelyn Purchase, who died from severe pneumonia in April 2013, got a voicemail from her daughter as she was dying, after Dr Ahmed allegedly failed to diagnose the condition.

Prince William met the pair at Headingley Stadium - the home of Leeds Rhinos and where both men used to play. Burrow and Sinfield were awarded CBEs in the New Year Honours list for their motor neurone disease fundraising. The pair have raised more than £15m for charities since Burrow was diagnosed with the disease in 2019. ""I brought your CBEs up here to give to you today if that's okay,"" the prince told them. ""While you're in your home, in Leeds, surrounded by your family and friends - I thought today was a good day."" Presenting Burrow, 41, with the honour, he said: ""The most amount of thank yous and congratulations for all the inspirational work you've done Rob, you've been amazing and everyone's so proud of you."" Sinfield, 43, has completed a series of epic endurance challenges, including his latest fundraiser which saw him complete seven ultra marathons over seven days. His target was to raise £77,777, but thousands of donations helped him to reach £2.7m. ""A huge, huge congratulations, it's been amazing what you've done,"" he told the former player. ""The groundswell you've created in terms of fundraising and looking after each other and for MND is huge."" The prince added: ""Make sure you look after your knees, your hips, and everything else, but it's been incredible."" Welcoming Prince William to the stadium, Burrow told him: ""My children have been practising their curtesy and talking about meeting you all week."" Burrow joked about a nickname ex-rugby union star Mike Tindall had coined for the Prince of Wales - One Pint Willy. Tindall made the admission while he appeared with his wife Zara, the prince's cousin, on Burrow's podcast. The prince replied: ""You got the nicknames out of him, he apologised to me about that."" Burrow, a former scrum-half who spent his entire professional career with the Rhinos, was diagnosed with MND two years after retiring from the sport. Since then, he has campaigned alongside friends and family to fundraise and generate awareness of the disease. Playing alongside each other from 2001 to 2015, Burrow and Sinfield won seven Grand Finals, two Challenge Cup Finals at Wembley and three World Club titles together. Talking to the pair about their playing careers, the prince called them ""quite a successful combination"" and referred to Burrow as a player with ""quick hands and quick feet"". ""No one could catch you,"" he added. After being described by the prince as an inspiration to the MND community, Burrow replied: ""I can honestly say that I never set out to be an inspiration, I just wanted to try and help other people in a similar situation to me. ""I'm just trying to live my best life with the cards that I've been dealt."" Burrow was joined at Headingley Stadium by his wife Lindsey and their three children. He added: ""I wouldn't be here without the love and support of my wife Lindsey. She is stronger than any rugby player I ever played against."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The council is responsible for services including waste disposal, fire and rescue, social care and roads maintenance.It is proposing to increase its share of the annual charge for Band D properties from £1,503 to £1,578 from April, adding £75 a year to the average bill.District, city and parish councils also put a charge on bills, as does the Lincolnshire Police and Crime Commissioner.Last April average Band D bills across Lincolnshire topped £2,000 for the first time. Mr Hill said 2% of the 5% rise would be ring-fenced for social care services, where demand is increasing.He said the government ""won't give us any more money"" to pay for a rise in the NMW in April, which will go up by £1.02 to £11.44.""Of course it's very good news for those who will get more money but it has to be paid for,"" Mr Hill added. The council's Labour leader and joint leader of the opposition, Ms Lee, said it was right that the NMW is rising ""in these inflationary times"" but said it was ""unfair for the Government to expect councils to pay for it"".Reacting to the proposed 5% increase, she said: ""Very reluctantly, from a personal perspective, I would support it as I don't think it can be avoided."" The county council's budget for services in the current financial year is £604m of which £365.5m is funded from council tax bills.  The remainder comes from business rates and Government grants.The 5% increase would raise an extra £18m.A public consultation has begun into the proposed rate rise.A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the council had seen ""an increase in core spending power of 11.9% compared to the previous year"".“In the Government’s funding proposals for next year (2024-25), we have proposed £690.8m for Lincolnshire County Council – a further increase in Core Spending Power of up to 7% in cash terms,"" the spokesperson said.“This is part of an overall funding package worth over £64bn to support councils in England to deliver frontline services.“Councils are ultimately responsible for managing their own budgets, however we stand ready to speak to any with concerns.”","['Elderly people', 'Lincolnshire County Council', 'Social care']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3bc4/live/19c3dcf0-b09b-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/6a34/live/2839ada0-afc9-11ee-b943-0bb3d149479a.jpg']",['Sharon Edwards'],UK,England

Linda Philips, 72, and Amanda Riley, 49, died near the junction of Kitts Green Road and Mackadown Lane. Their MG ZS hit a BMW which had been in collision with a quad bike, police said. Both drivers fled with the quad bike removed before police arrived. Officers want the drivers and any witnesses to contact them. Four other people involved in the crash, which occurred at about 20:00 GMT, including a young child, were taken to hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. The devastated family of the crash victims said earlier this month that Linda was a dearly loved wife and great-grandmother while Amanda was a beautiful mother and grandmother. They have also appealed for anyone with information to come forward and help the investigation. On Thursday, Det Sgt Paul Hughes, said: ""This is an extremely tragic set of circumstances which has left a family devastated."" Officers were still piecing together the circumstances of what happened, Mr Hughes said, but now believe the BMW 4 Series and the quad bike were both involved in a collision prior to the BMW colliding with the MG. ""The driver of the BMW and the rider of the quad bike then both left the scene, prior to the arrival of police, and they were assisted in doing so by others,"" he said. ""The quad bike was also removed from the scene. I do not know the reason for this, and it may be that those people did not know the full extent of the collision at that time, but they do now. ""I would appeal directly to the driver and rider, the people who assisted them, or any friends or family to come forward now, and do the right thing by this family.""

The Unite union says the workers, who are employed by BaxterStorey, want a £1 an hour increase. Industrial action started in early December and there are plans for further strikes later this month. BaxterStorey said it had already brought in the Living Wage pay rise and was introducing a new benefits package focused on ""wellbeing and family"".

""With the cost of living crisis, we can't carry on working for peanuts. It's just not on. We're not young kids and we need to keep our heads above water,"" said canteen worker Jane Carr.

""These strikes will continue until an acceptable offer is put forward.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-67943748,Whitchurch demolition work begins towards new £13m pool,Work to demolish a swimming pool to make way for,2024-01-11,"Work to demolish a swimming pool to make way for a £13.1m replacement has begun. Shropshire Council said the new centre in Whitchurch will include a six-lane, 25m pool, a gym and a cafe. It said it would be the best way to replace the old facility which had not been able to open since March 2020 when defects were found with the pool. Work was due to be completed on the new centre by the middle of 2025, the authority said. When it opened, it would be run by Shropshire Community Leisure Trust and Serco, who run several other leisure centres for the council. Councillor Peggy Mullock said: ""It is great to see the old building finally being removed. We have waited many years to have a quality swimming pool."" The council made the decision to go ahead with the replacement pool in April 2022 after putting on hold two other schemes in Shrewsbury. One of those, the creation of new pools at Shrewsbury Sports Village, at Sundorne, at a cost of £28m, has since been revived. Cabinet members will decide next week whether to begin a public consultation on those plans. A cabinet report said the council would look at options for the Quarry site once the Sports Village project was ""sufficiently advanced"". It said the council was subsidising the operation of both sites and the poor condition and age of the Quarry site had resulted in increasing repairs and maintenance costs. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said it meant any plans to redevelop the Quarry site looked set to be permanently shelved, with the council acknowledging it was ""not financially viable"" to maintain two facilities in the town. However, the council said, if approved, the new site in Sundorne was expected to save £250,000 a year in subsidies. Both the pool in Whitchurch and the proposed Sports Village pools in Shrewsbury would be funded by the council, which was also looking to make cuts in 2024 in attempt to balance its books. The authority hoped the new pools in Shrewsbury would attract regional competitions and swimming galas to the town. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Starting in Cliff Road, on the banks of the Humber estuary, the trail follows the start of the Yorkshire Wolds Way. The trail forms part of the Active Beacons: Photoposts Project, which aims to boost health while monitoring the East Riding's changing coastline. People are encouraged to take photographs at each of the wood-turned posts and upload them to social media. The new posts join 26 existing photoposts dotted along the East Yorkshire coast. They can be found at these locations: Nick Coultish, cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the photoposts had become ""increasingly popular"" among those wishing to explore the county's coastline. Using the What3Words app, people can find the latest trail, which is two miles (3.2km) each way, at the following locations: Hashtag information can be found at each location, enabling people to easily upload images to social media. Source: East Riding of Yorkshire Council Mr Coultish encouraged people to think about ""the serious issue of coastal erosion"" as they complete the trail. ""Help us monitor this by uploading images to social media,"" he said. The project is a joint initiative between the council, tourism agency Visit East Yorkshire, and the University of Hull's Energy & Environment Institute.

Mr Raab said he understood residents would be concerned about the changes.He added: “I will be seeking urgent meetings with the surgery to raise these concerns and will also raise this with the health secretary.”New roles at the surgery include pharmacists, advanced nursing and paramedic practitioners and paediatric nurses. In 2019, the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme was introduced to the NHS, meaning primary care networks could claim money for the salaries of staff other than GPs.Monica Harding, the Lib Dem parliamentary candidate in Esher and Walton, said such roles should supplement the work of GPs, not replace them.She added: “We want more GPs, not less. They are more expensive but there’s a reason for that.” Richard, a patient from Thames Ditton, told BBC Radio Surrey it was ""very challenging"" to get a GP appointment at the surgery.He also described a “long online process” to get appointments, raising concerns about those without internet access.“It seems bonkers to be losing GPs when the health crisis is so acute,” he added.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, external, on X, external, and on Instagram, external.

https://www.bbc.com/news/education-67937273,Pass rate falls for GCSE maths resits in England,"The pass rate for GCSE maths resits in England has fallen, after more students had to take their exams again.",2024-01-11,"The pass rate for GCSE maths resits in England has fallen, after more students had to take their exams again. November's exam results show 22.9% of maths entries were marked at a grade 4, a standard pass, or above, down from 24.9% in 2022 and 26.9% in 2019. However, the pass rate for GCSE English resits rose to 40.3% - up from 38% and 32.3% respectively. Under-18s in England must retake GCSE English and maths if they did not get at least a grade 4. The overall GCSE pass rate fell last summer, when grades in England were brought back in line with pre-pandemic levels. Exams sat in November, which are typically resits, were marked on the same basis. Ahead of the November resits, colleges told the BBC they were having to expand class sizes and hire exam halls to cope with a rising number of pupils taking compulsory GCSE resits. Exams were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 and grades were based on teachers' assessments, leading to a rise in top results. Grades were brought back to 2019 levels in England last summer - meaning a lower pass-rate, and, therefore, more students having to take compulsory resits. More than 167,000 students in England received grade 3 or lower on their maths paper last summer - about 21,000 more than in 2022. A further 172,000 failed English language - 38,000 more. At the same time, there are more teenagers coming through the system. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests there will be a 17% rise in the number of 16 and 17-year-olds between 2019 and 2024 - an extra 200,000 young people. Although the pass rate fell in maths, the raw number of passes in both maths and English grew, because more students sat November exams than in previous years. There were 117,098 entries for maths and English in November - compared with 91,357 in 2022 and 102,960 in 2019. Eddie Playfair, senior policy manager at the Association of Colleges, welcomed the rise in pass grades. He said November candidates will be ""only a subset of the total number resitting"" - as students can also resit in the summer - and ""will tend to be those most likely to improve their grade quickly"". England's exams regulator, Ofqual, said the return to ""normal grading"" last year meant it was ""not meaningful to make direct comparisons between results in recent November series"". Comparisons with 2019 were included in the release of the November results - the last year exams were sat before the pandemic. Tom Middlehurst, assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said the compulsory resit policy ""consigns the majority of young people to a remorseless cycle of falling below the grade 4 bar"". He said schools and colleges have tried to help students catch up on ""lost learning"" because of the Covid pandemic, but have ""constrained resources"". The fall in the maths pass rate comes after the government announced plans to replace A-levels and T-levels with a new Advanced British Standard which would include some English and maths to 18. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said: ""Young people who leave education with a good grasp of English and maths have a much better chance of securing a job or going on to further study."" The DfE said it was investing an extra £1.6bn in colleges by 2024-25, compared with the 2021-22 financial year, and an extra £470m over this year and next would would help colleges boost recruitment and retention of staff.

Rubbina Shaheen, who worked in Shrewsbury, was jailed in 2010 as a result of Horizon the faulty software used by the Post Office. In April 2021, the Court of Appeal quashed Mrs Shaheen's conviction. She and husband Mohamed Hami lost their home following her conviction and they were forced to sleep in a van. Mrs Shaheen, originally from Birmingham, said it finally felt like the victims were being listened to. Compensation measures were announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday followed an ITV drama about the Horizon scandal. Mr Hami said the TV series ""highlighted what really happened to the post-masters and mistresses"". The scandal had been covered in news reports previously and Mr Hami said he had told the story to friends and family, but the drama showed what it was really like for the victims and their families. The government has said it intends to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the Post Office scandal. It said it aims to complete the process by the end of 2024 and Mr Sunak said 555 former postmasters who brought a group lawsuit will be offered an upfront payment of £75,000. ""That's what we wanted from the start, somebody just to listen to us and to get it sorted out,"" Mrs Shaheen said. More than 700 branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on evidence from the faulty software over 16 years - now described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history. To date though, only 93 people have had their convictions overturned. Mrs Shaheen was accused of taking £43,000 from her branch and at the time, she said: ""It just felt as though the ground opened and swallowed you up, it felt that bad. ""You couldn't get your head round it, you couldn't even think straight."" She later suffered renal failure, which she believes was brought on by the stress of her situation. Mrs Shaheen had always maintained her innocence and in April 2021, appeal judges confirmed her innocence and that the Horizon system was to blame.

Sam Boulter, secretary of the Honeybourne Railway Club near Evesham, Worcestershire, said EDF Energy recommended the club switch to a pay-as-you-go plan to save on costs. But on 4 January, the day of the switch, all power in the building was lost and members have been unable to use the facility. An EDF spokesperson apologised, said it was investigating the issue as a priority and the power was restored on Wednesday night. Speaking to BBC Hereford and Worcester, Mr Boulter said: “I’ve been here 20 years as club secretary and I’ve never known anything like it.“I’ve spoken to them [EDF Energy] several times and it’s exactly the same, ‘we are sorry, we are trying all our best' and all this rubbish. “They must train them to be so polite but nothing’s happening.""The club depended on its weekend bingo sessions for income and had been unable to host them since the switch day, he added.

Sadiq Khan is calling for a ""new settlement"" with the EU, which comes as new research suggests Brexit has cost London's economy £30bn so far. The study by Cambridge Econometrics predicts by 2035 the value of goods and services produced in the capital will be 7% less than without Brexit. The government says the UK economy has grown faster since Brexit than that of Germany, France, and many EU countries. The study by the research consultancy suggests there are 290,000 fewer jobs in the capital than would have been created without the UK leaving the EU. However, economic performance in the capital is - and will continue to be - better than the rest of the country, it finds. ""Productivity growth is expected to be stronger in London than the UK as a whole,"" the report said. ""London's economy is expected to be more resilient and experience relatively less damage from Brexit than the rest of the UK."" It means Brexit will further widen the productivity gap between London and the rest of the UK over the next decade, due to a larger projected slowdown in growth in the rest of the UK. In the capital, the biggest impact on jobs will be in construction and manufacturing, while the biggest monetary impact will be on the finance sector. Gross Value Added (GVA) will be £63bn lower in 2035 than without Brexit - two-thirds of this from less revenue from financial services, the study suggests. In a speech to the London Government Dinner at Mansion House later, the London mayor Sadiq Khan will call for a ""new settlement"" with the EU to ""turbocharge our economy and help raise living standards"". Mr Khan is expected to say this evening: ""It's now obvious that Brexit isn't working.

The University of Birmingham said extra appointments cost between £23m and £60m a year. The study examined more than 950,000 electronic healthcare records since the start of the global pandemic. People with long Covid report symptoms including persistent coughs and brain fog. The condition is defined as having symptoms three months after the initial infection, which last for two months or more. Analysis of the economic impact of long Covid has been published in BMC Primary Care - a peer-reviewed journal that considers articles on primary health care research. The new study's research team was led by the university and funded by grants from two bodies, the National Institute for Health and Care Research and UK Research and Innovation. Factors found to increase primary care costs included being older, female, white, obese or someone with long-term health conditions. Co-lead author Dr Shamil Haroon, from the university, said: ""We might expect that patients who are older or who have long-term health conditions will need additional primary care support, but we have also seen additional costs associated with being white and female."" He said that using data from the earliest parts of the pandemic, the team had looked at a ""balanced sample size of those who have had Covid and those who hadn't"". Dr Haroon added: ""Long Covid as a condition also continues to be poorly understood and underdiagnosed.""

Chris Skidmore, who resigned over the government's energy plans, will also be replaced as MP for Kingswood. North Northamptonshire Council has confirmed that the Wellingborough by-election will be held on 15 February. The election in Kingswood is expected to take place on the same day. Mr Skidmore said he had ""no regrets"" over leaving Parliament. The former MP for Kingswood, near Bristol, formally quit Parliament on Monday after announcing last week that he was resigning the Conservative whip over the government's plans to issue new oil and gas licences. Mr Skidmore said he had become increasingly at odds government policy on the environment over the past 18 months. Labour have already started campaigning in Mr Skidmore's seat. Damien Egan, Labour's candidate who resigned as mayor of Lewisham on Wednesday, grew up in the constituency. Mr Skidmore took the seat from Labour in 2010 and secured an 11,000 vote majority in the 2019 general election. Parliament's behaviour watchdog found Mr Bone had exposed himself to an aide and physically struck him. Mr Bone denies the allegations. The 71-year-old was first elected for Wellingborough in 2005, growing his party's share of the vote to an 18,500 majority in 2019. But Prime Minister Rishis Sunak has admitted the by-election would be ""difficult"" for the Tories. The majority is smaller than those the Tories had in both Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire, which were both lost to Labour in by-elections last year. Mr Bone could stand as an independent candidate. But this is unlikely as the Conservative Party has selected Mr Bone's partner Helen Harrison as its candidate. Gen Kitchen will be standing for the Labour Party and Ana Savage Gunn will represent the Lib Democrats. The Green Party candidate is Will Morris.","['Wellingborough', 'Bristol', 'Chris Skidmore', 'Peter Bone']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E356/production/_132089185_peterbonemppa.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16163/production/_132276409_skidmore_pa.jpg']",['Sam Francis'],UK,England
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0ddex4z2ro,Magnum founder dies days before album release,N/A,2024-01-11,"Tony Clarkin, the founder of hard rock band Magnum, has died aged 77. The Birmingham-born musician served as the band's songwriter and guitarist for more than 50 years. Magnum, who are due to release their 23rd studio album this week, recently cancelled an upcoming tour and revealed Clarkin had been diagnosed with a rare spinal condition. Daughter Dionne released a statement on behalf of family members saying he died peacefully on Sunday following the short illness. She said it was a privilege to call him dad and revealed he had died surrounded by loved ones. “I know that Tony has touched so many people through his music in so many different ways,"" the statement read. ""I don’t really have words to express what he meant to me right now as the grief is too fresh."" Ms Clarkin added her family intended to establish a charitable trust to reflect her father's love of animals. ""Please do not send flowers or cards as he would have much preferred expressions of sympathy to go to charity in this way,"" she added. Clarkin's death came just a week after Magnum released new song The Seventh Darkness. It was taken from the upcoming studio album Here Comes The Rain, which is due for release on Friday. ""The recordings were great fun, especially the moment when Chris’s sax took the lead and my guitar responded,"" Clarkin said in a press release announcing the single. The prolific band have released 22 studio albums over their five decades. Among them is 1988's Wings Of Heaven, which sold more than 60,000 copies and reached number five on the UK album charts.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-67922474,Organ donors: Wiltshire mum's plea to turn 'sorrow into hope',"The mother of a two-year-old girl who needs a heart transplant is asking people to help turn ""sorrow to hope"" and become an organ donor.",2024-01-11,"The mother of a two-year-old girl who needs a heart transplant is asking people to help turn ""sorrow to hope"" and become an organ donor. Jodie's daughter Amelia, from Chippenham, is in hospital indefinitely while they wait for a compatible heart. She said a donation means ""life springs from death, sorrow turns to hope, and a terrible loss becomes a gift"". Amelia is part of a national NHS campaign to highlight the number of children waiting for a transplant. The campaign has seen Amelia - and 15 other children - made into handmade dolls that have been placed across the country. Amelia's doll is in Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where she is currently receiving treatment and is connected to a machine that supports her failing heart. It is hoped that the dolls will inspire more parents and families to consider adding themselves and their children onto the NHS Organ Donor Register. Jodie said organ donation is ""so important"" as it gives a child a ""gift of life and be able to go home with family"". The mum-of-two added: ""I don't know when we'll be home. ""There's a saying we like to say and it's without the organ donor there is no story, no hope, no transplant, but when there is an organ donor, life springs from death, sorrow turns to hope, and a terrible loss becomes a gift. ""If you are willing to accept an organ from someone else to save yours or someone you love's life then why not donate your organs once you pass."" Amelia was born with a heart condition, arriving nine weeks early, but she was doing well before her health deteriorated in Summer 2022 when she was just one-year-old. Jodie initially thought it was an ear infection, but Amelia was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, svt and tachycardia. She explained Amelia was listed for a heart transplant in the autumn and a few weeks later was given a Berlin heart - a device that supports a child in severe heart failure. ""She is doing ok and is a typical nearly three-year-old in some ways, always on the go,"" she said. ""We arrived with a one and a half year old and I was 11 weeks pregnant. Now I have a nearly three-year-old and very nearly one-year-old, Blossom. ""It is challenging but we're ok, we're cracking on each day, the girls keep me busy and what else can we do."" Jodie added: ""If she goes down to intensive care then I will say to her 'do you want to go back home?' and she will say yes. I ask 'do you want to go to bear ward?' and she will say yes. ""She thinks bear ward is our home."" Three sites across Bristol are hosting the 'Waiting to Live' dolls, each representing a child on the waiting list. The sites are: University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and NHS Blood and Transplant's Filton and Stoke Gifford centres. Joanna Woodland, paediatric renal clinical nurse specialist at UHBW, said: ""It is inspiring to see the happiness in the patients we care for and their families when they are told an organ has been found for them and knowing the future possibilities, and opportunities this will provide for them."" Angie Scales, lead nurse for paediatric organ donation at NHS Blood and Transplant, added: ""When organ donation becomes a possibility, it is often in very sudden or unexpected circumstances. ""When families have already had the opportunity to consider organ donation previously or know already it is something they support, it makes a difficult situation that bit easier."" Jodie added: ""We just want parents to think about other options if your child sadly does pass. Your child could save nine other childrens' lives that are waiting. ""But I do not think people, parents or guardians talk about it much because they do not want to think about their child passing away."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Doctors first thought pains in Honey's legs were growing pains but her mum Julie said her ""mother's instinct was telling me there was more to it"".

""To look at her, you wouldn't know everything Honey has been through,"" her mother said. Julie, 36, said her daughter was tested from the age of six but after four years of tests, doctors could not see anything wrong and thought they were growing pains. ""It got to the point where Honey was limping because to walk was too painful at times. My mother's instinct was telling me there was more to it,"" Julie said. ""I pushed for a referral to the hospital, but never expected to be told that Honey had something growing in her brain."" After five years of stable scans since her diagnosis in 2019, Honey found out her tumour, called a cerebellopontine angle epidermoid cyst, had grown. ""Doctors told us that Honey probably had the tumour when she was in the womb which is terrifying to think about,"" Julie said. ""Had her tumour not been found when it was, Honey could have been left with irreversible conditions and our story may have been very different."" In January, two months after the surgery, the Year 10 pupil returned to school in time to take part in her mock GCSEs.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67943207,Sofia Duarte: Mum calls for e-bike battery rules after daughter death,The mother of a woman who died in a fire thought to be caused by a converted e-bike battery is petitioning the government for more regulation.,2024-01-11,"The mother of a woman who died in a fire thought to be caused by a converted e-bike battery is petitioning the government for more regulation. Maria Frasquilho Macarro's daughter, Sofia Duarte, 21, died in the fire at her flat on Old Kent Road, Southwark, on New Year's Day 2023. London Fire Brigade (LFB) is backing the new petition. The government previously said those making and selling consumer products must ensure they were safe. The petition calls for urgent government action to implement regulations on e-bikes, e-scooters as well as the batteries and the chargers sold with them. Speaking as her only daughter would have marked her 23rd birthday, Ms Frasquilho Macarro said: ""This matters so much to me, because the most important thing in my whole world has been taken away - all because of some stupid bike."" Ms Duarte's family friend Alda Simoes, who set up the petition, said: ""We don't want Sofia to die in vain, sadly deaths are continuing to happen. ""Tragically, others have lost their lives up and down the UK, and there are many who have suffered serious injuries too. We must stop this happening today, not tomorrow. Together we can make change."" More than 17,000 signatures have been collected so far in support of the petition, and the charity Electrical Safety First has also lent its support to the campaign. Following the fire in south-east London, LFB said investigators found a bicycle had been converted into an e-bike and the bike's lithium battery pack had failed, causing the fire and blocking Ms Duarte's escape route. The brigade added such conversion kits enabled people to add an electric motor to their bikes, but not all of them are sold with a battery. Cheaper batteries sold online do not necessarily adhere to UK safety regulations, and were more likely to fail and present an increased fire risk, it added. It has now launched a campaign called Charge Safe, which is calling for people to follow safety advice. An inquest into Ms Duarte's death is ongoing and LFB said it had been granted special permission to raise awareness of the fire risks to try to prevent future deaths. It comes as LFB data shows that on average there was a fire every two days in 2023, and last year the total number of fires involving e-bikes and e-scooters went up almost 60%, at 183 compared to 116 in 2022. Deputy Mayor for Fire and Resilience Fiona Twycross said: ""Sofia's death was a tragedy that should never have happened. I'm proud to support the tireless campaigning of her family and friends to ensure this tragedy is not repeated."" She called on the government to introduce a ""long overdue regulatory framework to improve safety"". Charlie Pugsley, LFB's assistant commissioner for fire safety, said: ""Cheaper parts bought online are more likely to be unsafe, increasing the risk of a fire. We always recommend purchasing items from a reputable high-street seller. ""If there's an offer that seems too good to be true, it probably is. It is also essential to use the correct charger for the battery, otherwise the risk of fire is much greater."" She added the Office for Product Safety and Standards was researching e-bike fires, but said the findings needed ""to be released as soon as possible"". ""Along with conversion kits, batteries and chargers also require much-needed legislation to ensure these products are more strictly regulated,"" she said. Current government requirements stipulate electrically assisted pedal cycles (EAPCs) must show the power output, the battery's voltage and have a maximum power output of 250 watts. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson previously said: ""Manufacturers, importers and distributors of consumer products must ensure that the products supplied, including the batteries and chargers that power them, are safe and that they have complied with the relevant product safety regulations before placing their products on the UK market.""

The cast-iron pipe at Bleadon Hill, Somerset, was previously used to allow noxious gases to escape from underground sewers. Wessex Water were required to remove the top section of the pipe for 'safety reasons', but do plan to replace it. ""It had a crown on it. I think it was probably the King of stink pipes,"" said local resident Alan Holly. Ventilation pipes were originally designed to release harmful gases far above ground level to prevent inhalation or unpleasant smells. They became obsolete in the 20th century due to advances in sewage processing and very few remained, though another surviving pipe recently gained recognition as a popular 'tourist attraction'. A spokesperson from Wessex Water said: ""We were required to remove the top sections of the vent stack pipe, which had become unsafe, but the base has been preserved. ""We are currently arranging a replacement for the upper sections which will be coated in anti-climb paint as a precaution,"" they added. The 'stink pipe' beside the A370 now stands at around one metre tall, covered temporarily with a black plastic bin liner. ""It's just always been there, a local landmark,"" said Mr Holly, who lives opposite the pipe. ""I think it was cut up. I saw small pieces of pipe going in the back of a truck, so I think it's long gone,"" he continued. Though the utility company plan to replace the tall structure, local residents say the heritage value is already lost. ""It was definitely much more magnificent then. It's just an eyesore now,"" Mr Holly added. ""On the one hand it's only an 18ft rusty pipe, but it was an 18ft rusty pipe with a lot of meaning for people,"" said local writer, Mike Gustell. Mr Gutsell had even written a short ghost story about the pipe, with the tall chimney releasing spirits trapped beneath the hill. He said it was ""terrible"" to see the original pipe shortened, adding: ""I don't think a black plastic bin liner is going to keep any spirits in."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The transport for her son and daughter who have special educational needs was ""absolutely vital"" to get to school on time, she added.""And so, you know, one [problem] gets sorted, and then there'll be an issue with the other one. ""And then you get through that, and then there'll be an issue with the first one, and these range from all sorts of things, quite severe issues with the bus not turning up."" In 2020, a group of head teachers wrote to the city council saying they had no confidence in the school transport service for children with special needs. It followed cases where some pupils were not picked up from home and others dropped off at the wrong school. The mother-of-three said she had been experiencing problems like last-minute cancellations and a lack of communication with the service since she started using it more than 10 years ago.""I'm thinking about not using [the transport] because it is so stressful to use,"" she added.Birmingham City Council said families whose children are aged 16-18 and qualify for travel assistance are required to make a financial contribution to their transport.""At the end of December letters were sent to families who had not yet paid the contribution to remind them to make payment,"" the authority said.""Unfortunately, letters were also sent to some families who had already paid,"" it added.The apology letter had ""made the situation worse"" for some parents, Mrs Aziz said. She explained that she had contacted the council on their behalf explaining that some had been unable to pay for transport via direct debit.

The Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal against a government decision allowing UK Oil & Gas (UKOG) to explore a site in Dunsfold. Ashley Herman, who lives near the site, said the disruption to traffic, local businesses and the environment were not in proportion to potential benefits. UKOG said the project would benefit energy and economic interests. The application from the energy company had been approved by the government, despite it twice being refused by Surrey County Council. Mr Herman raised concerns the access to the site. ""It's rolling hills and beautiful countryside, and has small, little lanes and sunken roads,"" he told BBC Radio Surrey. ""It is so narrow, you can probably just about fit a bin lorry down it. I don't know how they're going to access this site at all."" He said the entire village had worked together to try to prevent the project. ""The mood here is absolutely furious,"" he said. ""The disruption it is going to cause to the village and to the people who live around the site will be enormous and out of proportion to any potential benefits."" Kirsty Cluff, a campaigner from Extinction Rebellion and the Weald Action Group, said the decision was unbeneficial to the climate emergency. ""It was the hottest year on record last year. Climate change is happening now, and burning fossil fuels is by far the biggest contributor,"" she said. ""This is not justice for the people, for the climate or the environment."" UKOG said it would be able to extract gas from the Dunsfold site worth £123m. ""We are pleased that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has once again dismissed the legal challenge to our Loxley project and has confirmed that its planning consent is entirely lawful, as the company and its counsel has maintained,"" a spokesperson said. The firm also said the project was in keeping with the government's Hydrogen, Energy Security and Net Zero strategies.

Shropshire Council wants to increase charges to encourage drivers to park cars outside Shrewsbury's river loop and walk, cycle or use public transport to get into town. Its cabinet is being asked to consider the changes at a meeting this week. But businesses say they are worried it will stop people visiting and make it harder for staff to get to work. The local authority said the changes are being proposed to encourage more active travel and the use of public transport, and raise money for car park maintenance. Recommendations include charging for parking until 20:00, rather than 18:00 at present, in Shrewsbury and to introduce or increase Sunday and bank holiday charges across the county. The council said if proposals were approved, it could generate an extra £1.76m, once costs are taken into account. If agreed the charges will come into effect on 1 April and Shrewsbury would contribute 71% of the overall increase in parking income. The report to the meeting states that in order to encourage people to park outside the town centre, improvements were needed to the reliability and frequency of the park and ride service is needed. Research would also need take place into the feasibility of a late bus for people unable to catch the current last bus at 18:30, it added. Cabinet would also be asked to agree a Parking Asset Improvement Plan for the repair and maintenance of car parks throughout Shropshire. Dan Morris, council cabinet member for highways and transport, said the plans include increasing the number of parking spaces available, as well as reduce emissions. But Seb Slater, executive director of Shrewsbury Business Improvement District (BID) said it was ""very concerned"" about the plans. ""The proposed extension of charging hours until 8pm and the reduction of Sunday parking offers, pose a threat to the town's evening and Sunday economies,"" he said. He said the BID would lobby the council to reconsider the plans and businesses were being urged to share their views through a dedicated survey. Deborah Carvell, owner of Carvell on the Square, Carvell Lingerie and Swimwear and soon to be opened Deja Vu, said: ""As the owner of multiple independent businesses in Shrewsbury, I'm incredibly concerned about the impact of these proposals. ""These price hikes threaten to deter people from visiting the town centre, will be hugely challenging for Shrewsbury workers from across the county and will undoubtedly threaten the vitality of our economy.""

Funeral directors will be hit with the penalty only if they fail to pick up bodies promptly from the public mortuary in Flax Bourton, near Bristol. Bristol City Council voted through the proposal amid concerns the mortuary is running out of space. One funeral director said the issue is caused by larger companies ""ruining it for everyone"". The byelaw would charge funeral directors a fine after three days following the end of a coroner's investigation. Flax Bourton mortuary investigates unexplained or unnatural deaths in Bristol, South Gloucestershire, North Somerset, and Bath and North East Somerset. A report to Bristol City Council said: ""There is increasing pressure on storage capacity at Flax Bourton mortuary. ""This is partly due to some funeral directors not collecting deceased people promptly. ""At the moment, funeral businesses make no payment to help cover the costs of keeping the deceased at Flax Bourton mortuary. ""This means the cost is borne by taxpayers. Some funeral directors … are keeping deceased people at the mortuary for long periods after the coroner has released the bodies for collection."" Funeral directors have said part of the problem is national direct cremation companies using Flax Bourton as ""their own private mortuary"". One funeral business said: ""Where humanly possible we always collect our deceased within three working days, and we are fortunate that we have the mortuary facilities at our premises. ""It is a shame the larger and direct funeral companies are now ruining it for everyone, by using the facilities as their own private mortuary.""

But Northumberland County Council leader Glen Sanderson confirmed on Wednesday there had been a delay, adding he was ""sure"" trains would be running by December. The delay has been blamed on ""challenging conditions"", particularly at Bedlington. Speaking at a meeting of the Ashington and Blyth Local Area Council, Mr Sanderson said he hoped the project would progress sooner.He said: “It is happening. By November or December, I’m sure trains will be running on that line – it may be sooner, but I’m not sure.“Don’t blame the county council for the engineering. There have been very challenging conditions, particularly at Bedlington. We can’t overcome them, we have to be patient. “They will be open six months after the trains start running. I don’t want it to be late, but it is not the county council or the Government’s fault.“I think rather than saying it might be a few months late running, we say it is going to be a fantastic thing for our residents and our visitors.” The Northumberland Line will see passenger rail brought back to the south east of the county for the first time since the 1960s, connecting Bedlington, Ashington and Blyth with Newcastle. Rumours of delays had been circling since November, but the Conservative leader of the council had previously refused to be drawn on when exactly the railway line would open, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Mr Sanderson also said the project had ended up costing “far more than we thought it would”.

Kingfisher Resorts wants to turn Knoll House Hotel in Studland into a holiday resort and had scaled-down its plans after its last application was refused. But Dorset Council's planning committee said the proposals needed more work. Committee chairman Toni Coombs said the redevelopment of the hotel was something ""we all want to see, but its got to be the right application"". The plans were refused on the grounds of the effect on important heathland sites, the Heritage Coast and the wider landscape, together with the scale and form of the new buildings, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Concerns were also raised about the effect on the area's dark skies zone, the need for a thorough biodiversity plan and more information about surface water drainage. Kingfisher previously said it had made every effort to address concerns raised by the previous application, reducing the height of the main 30-bed hotel building and reducing the number of apartments from 22 to 18. The firm said it aimed to create a high-end luxury resort, employing about 200 staff and accommodating about 280 guests. According to Kingfisher's website, Knoll House was built at the turn of the 20th Century as a summer retreat for a member of the Bankes family of Kingston Lacy. It was later used as a summer let before being turned into a hotel in 1931. The Eastern Area Planning Committee is due to meet on Wednesday at 10:00 GMT.

A total of 25 NHS contracts have been handed back across Sussex since 2020. Patient demand for NHS services in Sussex exceeds the capacity dentists are willing or able to provide, a recent report from NHS Sussex says. The government said it has invested £3bn each year to deliver dentistry. NHS Sussex, which is responsible for commissioning NHS dental services, will give an update report to West Sussex County Council later. The report found areas of deprivation, often with the highest levels of oral health needs, were particularly underserved by dentists. Dr Sami Butt, from S3 Dental in Haywards Heath, stopped treating NHS patients in April last year after 20 years. He said it was a ""tough decision"" but ""the scheme was underfunded and it was a terrible contract"". He claimed: ""Over the years dentists have tried to make it work but unfortunately, post pandemic, it's just no longer feasible. ""The cost of living crisis has really hit home for a lot of businesses and with the funding the NHS is providing it's just simply not enough to be able to see patients on the NHS."" He added: ""It was so sad because some of these patients have been with us since they were children. I've seen them grow up. ""It's just heartbreaking for a lot of us as clinicians."" In 2022, NHS Sussex was one of the first Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) to take in responsibility for commissioning primary, secondary and dental services, alongside community pharmacy and optometry services. But the government manages NHS dental contracts and the funding associated with them. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Last year 1.7m more adults and about 800,000 more children saw an NHS dentist compared with the previous year, but there is more to do, and the government is working on a dentistry plan with NHS England to make further improvements.

Sarah Harris made more than 100 bookings from St Thomas' Hospital to addresses near her home, a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel heard. Ms Harris told the panel she ""made up some names"" when booking the taxis, but she used patients' names 11 times. Her activity was discovered after a whistleblower told the hospital. The hearing was told she made the bookings, which cost about £42 per journey, between April and December 2020, using her mobile phone number and charging the journeys to the NHS. A panel heard Ms Harris initially denied the allegations but within 24 hours confessed, saying in a statement to her manager in December 2020 she had ""booked a taxi on a number of occasions"" to locations near her Bromley home. She said this was because she wanted to ""travel separately from the public"", writing in a statement of reflection she was ""constantly terrified of Covid 19"". She added: ""I saw countless bodies being moved to the morgue daily, which made me so afraid."" Ms Harris was sacked by the NHS trust in May 2021 but in November 2023 she told the NMC hearing she had grown since her wrongdoing and was no longer the same person. At the time of the hearing, she had paid back the £5,198.40 of taxi costs in full and was working in a new job at a GP surgery. She also said her ""spirituality"" and ""faith"" would prevent her from being dishonest again in the future. However, the fitness to practise panel decided to impose its most serious punishment on Ms Harris and banned her from working as a nurse, saying she had ""limited insight"" over the incident. It said she ""did not demonstrate a full understanding of the motivations for [her] behaviour"" and, as a result, there was a risk of ""further dishonest acts"" in the future. Explaining its decision to remove Ms Harris's name from the register, the panel said: ""Your actions were premeditated, sophisticated and deliberate. ""You used patients' names and details.

The court previously heard how the pair, who were ""under the influence of nitrous oxide"", chased Harley along Kings Mill Lane and then attacked him with knives in the early hours after a chance meeting last February. The boys were aged 14 and 16 at the time of the murder. They had been due to stand trial after pleading not guilty, but later changed their pleas to guilty. In a statement issued after sentencing, Harley's mother said: ""You two get to continue with your lives, Harley doesn't, I don't, his sisters don't, his brother doesn't. ""You have destroyed a whole family."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-67943619,"Birmingham: Self-harm by child, 6, highlighted by inquiry",A six-year-old child who was taken to their GP for self-harming was among harrowing mental health cases found by a council inquiry.,2024-01-11,"A six-year-old child who was taken to their GP for self-harming was among harrowing mental health cases found by a council inquiry. Children were struggling to get the support they needed in Birmingham, a report by councillors said. One councillor also described how a young person in the city had to receive treatment 300 miles away in Glasgow. The report said ""abhorrent living conditions"" due to the housing crisis were impacting mental health. The alarming report on whether the city is meeting young people's mental health needs was discussed at a Birmingham City Council meeting. In the example of the six-year-old, the inquiry heard their mum was forced to visit her GP because her child was self-harming but was told to go to the school for support. A survey of 28 staff and volunteers who work with young people has reportedly shown a ""sharp increase"" in mental health worries at school, including children who are ""crying every day"" and extremely body-conscious. The inquiry's report continued: ""There is an increase in tummy aches and minor illnesses where we as a school cannot identify real reason for absence but know there is more happening behind the scenes at home. ""Cost-of-living, family breakdowns, bereavements all have contributed to these issues."" Summing up the results of the survey, the report said: ""Children are bounced from the school to their GP back and forth as there are systemic failures."" It continued that GP referrals are ""rejected or take months to reach appointment"" and that ""the care is bad even with a suicidal child"". Early help services were found to be hard to access, while families were found to be on a ""merry-go-round"" of signposting, leading to people not getting help and ""just [giving] up"". The report also highlighted a lack of empathy from staff responding to a telephone call when a young person is in a crisis. Councillor Mick Brown, who was involved in the inquiry, told a meeting of the city council on Tuesday that there was also an urgent need for local beds when it came to mental health patients. He said: ""One particular under-21-year-old was actually placed in a unit in Glasgow from Birmingham and it's absolutely appalling - that situation in my view would never occur if someone's got a physical health issue. ""After a lifetime in health and social care, I have seen so many cases where unresolved issues have gone on to affect young people for their entire lives."" Councillor Kerry Jenkins urged the government to ""take stock of the exponentially growing need"" for mental health services and ""fund and staff them suitably"". She said: ""To not do so will result in a mental health pandemic and a whole generation of children who will go on into adulthood with enduring and serious mental health conditions. ""The fact [young people] cannot access the appropriate support is simply not acceptable. ""We cannot have a lost Covid generation - there must be government investment in mental health services.""

Nick Lupton, who lives between Worcester and Upton upon Severn in Worcestershire, also installed pumps at the former pub. The area had flooded 11 times since 2016 but he said the recent floods were one of the worst yet. He said building the barrier ""was the right thing to do"". ""We're into the recovery now, there's a few jobs to do, even though the wall's keeping it away from the house,"" the former engineer added. ""It's always a relief when the river goes down."" The property, part of which dates back to the 17th Century, was once the river ferry boat's inn and he and his wife, Annie, remortgaged it to pay for the wall all around their home. It took them four months to build from last summer and it was ready to be tested when there was flooding in October. Mr Lupton said it had been effective in keeping out the water this month as this was ""a really good test of it"". The flood barrier was built 30cm (12in) higher than the previous highest peak level for flooding at their home. Mr Lupton's home was connected to dry land again after he was cut off for a week. A BBC video of the flooding around his home has been viewed more than 30 million times. Dave Throup, who worked for the Environment Agency for 20 years and now lectured on climate change and flood prevention, warned flooding could become worse in the future. ""The floods we get at the moment are getting more and more extreme, we've been within half a metre to a metre of the top of all of the flood defences now,"" he said.

The landlords for the Harbour Close park in Littlehampton Marina said they needed to remove 38 caravans as they do not comply with standards required by the council. One tenant said she was ""heartbroken"" when she received the eviction letter. Arun District Council (ADC) said it would communicate with the tenants to ""assess housing need"". The council issued a licence in February 2023 requiring the site owners, Broomer Farm Trading Limited, to ensure the caravans met required standards by February 2028. A spokesperson for ADC said the existing caravans were ""holiday static caravans"" that were ""unsuitable for residential use"". Nichola Wilson, who pays £640 a month for her static caravan, fears she will not find anywhere else to live, especially as she has two dogs. Jaimee Bremer said she is now ""facing homelessness"". She says her caravan is so cold her toilet freezes over in winter and she has mould growing in her kitchen. ""I've made some really good friends and met supportive people. ""We all looked after each other in the pandemic - we've just been united for so long."" ADC said it had given the landlords the option to replace the caravans in stages ""to minimise disruption to existing tenants"", which did not require the site owner ""to have taken the approach they have"". However, Thomas Grubb from the Broomer Farm Group said the company would have to clear the site completely as replacing the accommodation would be ""very costly"". He said: ""We do regret the pressure to serve notice on our tenants, many of whom have been with us for a number of years.

Mr Ormrod was hit by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2007, resulting in the amputation of both legs and his right arm.

Security cameras outside the hotel where the theft took place failed to capture anything as another vehicle blocked the line of sight. Mr Ormrod, from Plymouth, shared details about the crime on his social media feeds, writing: ""They stole a bag full of sweaty gym cloths, another bag with my JiuJitsu Gi in and what's really inconvenient is they took a set of my prosthetic legs!""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-67935287,Hassop: Hundreds of 'exquisite' waxwings in the Peak District,Birdwatchers from across the UK have descended on a Derbyshire beauty spot to catch a glimpse of an exotic-looking bird.,2024-01-11,"Birdwatchers from across the UK have descended on a Derbyshire beauty spot to catch a glimpse of an exotic-looking bird. More than 350 waxwings have been spotted feasting on hawthorn berries at Hassop Station, near Bakewell, in the Peak District over the past few weeks. The birds from Scandinavia come over to feed when food is in short supply on the continent and for warmer weather. A bird charity says it could be a record year for waxwings in the county. Steve Thorpe, secretary of the Derbyshire Ornithological Society, said hundreds of waxwings had been gorging on berries at the station, on the Monsal Trail. ""We've counted up to 359 in this particular flock in Hassop,"" he said. Mr Thorpe added this season had been the best for spotting the colourful birds in the county and believed it could be a record year for sightings of the species. ""The Derbyshire record is 400 which was recorded in December 1970, so we are watching the number closely to see if we can beat the record this year,"" he said. Waxwings stay in the area until they have stripped the berries from the trees. Mr Thorpe said the flock arrived in Derbyshire in mid-December and believed they would remain for a further two weeks. The sudden influx - known as an irruption - of waxwings in the area has attracted birdwatchers from across the country each day. Dave Middleman, who travelled from Liverpool to Derbyshire to catch sight of the birds, said: ""We haven't had that many in Liverpool, so it's worth making the journey of about two hours. They're brilliant."" Dean Coupe, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, who has been birdwatching for 40 years, said: ""This is the first time I've ever seen them. I'm very impressed."" Fiona Maddock, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, said: ""I absolutely love waxwings. I've been a birder since a child. ""It's been 11 years since I've last seen some. This is the closest I've been to them. It's amazing. ""They're exquisite, they look as though they've been painted."" Mr Thorpe added there had also been ""enormous numbers"" of waxwings across the country this year, which is thought to be the best ""waxwing winter"" for a decade. Years without the birds visiting Britain are known as ""blank winters"". The British Trust for Ornithology said waxwings were ""rare, but regular winter visitors to the UK"". It said the last real influx was in 2012-13, but there were good numbers in 2015-16 too. The species is peach-coloured, with a black bandit-style eye mask and gets its name from the red colour in the wings, which is said to look like droplets from a wax candle.

Jameson Raid frontman Terry Dark said the group, now based in Europe, would happily come back to the West Midlands to play another gig at Walsall Town Hall should the opportunity arise. Stars including Slade and The Who have played at the venue that was designated a Grade II listed building in 1986. Walsall Council said it would give more information when available. Jameson Raid formed in the mid-1970s before splitting up in 1983. They reformed in 2008 and continue to perform. Councillor Pete Smith raised the issue of potential investment into the Leicester Street building at a meeting on Monday, having previously called for more showpiece events to be held there. In November, the authority said it proposed to seek advice from ""external consultants"" to understand the scope of facilities needed and the likely opportunities for larger events and ""revenue generation"" to assess the site's viability as a venue. The councillor revealed the band's frontman sent an email, stating he was fascinated to read Mr Smith had suggested renovations. Mr Dark's email stated: ""'With Jameson Raid, I was lucky enough to appear there on several occasions so I think it's a great idea. ""'If it should come to pass, I'll certainly bring Jameson Raid to help with the celebrations'."" Mr Smith asked if there was anything further he could tell Mr Dark and the Walsall community which had been asking about investment into the site. Councillor Ken Ferguson said the authority would provide updates with more detailed information when he had it. Others stars who have performed at Walsall Town Hall, which opened in 1903, include Robert Plant, Black Sabbath and Reverend and the Makers.

If negotiations go well between an unnamed sports event company and Swindon Borough Council, Swindon Half Marathon could return in September. Council leader Jim Robbins said while talks were ongoing, the race's return was ""not a done deal"". The Wiltshire event last took place in 2019. Mr Robbins told a meeting of the council's overview and scrutiny committee meeting on Monday: ""If the company does want to come to run the event, then they will want a multi-year deal."" The Swindon race could not go ahead in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. And the 2021 event, which was scheduled for 19 September, was cancelled by management company The Race Organiser just 11 days before it was due to take place. The company said the pandemic had increased its costs and there had been a significant drop in entries, compared to before the pandemic, which meant it could not afford to go ahead with the race.

The £20m would come from the council's existing general reserve. The authority said it still needed to make £11.1m of savings over the next five years, but in a worst case scenario would potentially need to save £19m.Mr Smith, executive councillor for finance and resources, said the refurbishment of the Guildhall would include more accommodation for businesses and making better use of its halls. He said: ""It is nearly 100 years old and we need to make use of it for the next 100 years.""We will have lots of small businesses in there. We already have restaurants in there at the rear of the building and we have many businesses come to the small and large halls, and we want to expand that use substantially.""He said he also wanted to create a new service centre at the site for people to meet staff and get advice, and make the Guildhall ""an attractive and productive space for our staff"".No detailed plans have been completed for the Market Square or Corn Exchange.

In October 2022, the force was moved into an enhanced level of monitoring by the police inspectorate. The watchdog found three areas for improvement: emergency call response, recording of crime and management of registered sex and violent offenders. ""Additional scrutiny"" has been lifted for the third strand, the force said. But it continues for emergency call response and recording of crime His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICRFS) said. Acting Chief Constable Jim Colwell said: ""I am extremely proud of the hard work and resilience of my officers and staff across the organisation who accepted HMICFRS's findings and have worked relentlessly over the last 18 months to resolve the management of violent and sexual offenders in our communities."" The force said HMICFRS had ""recognised clear and sustainable improvements"" in this area. It said this included investment in public protection teams, reducing officer workload and overdue visits, as well as a boost to staffing. The police inspectorate's monitoring process consists of two stages: scan and engage. All police forces are in the scan phase by default, but may be escalated to engage, as was the case with Devon and Cornwall Police. Following the decision to launch extra monitoring, a further report from the inspectorate in February 2023 identified the need for urgent improvements in the three areas. Inspectors calculated the force had failed to record more than 18,000 crimes over a one-year period. Call response times were also a concern, with some people waiting ""over an hour"" after dialling 101. Identification of repeat and vulnerable callers was missed, and callers were not always given the appropriate advice on preservation of evidence or crime prevention, the inspectorate found. It also found the force was unable to adequately manage registered sexual and violent offenders, which it said meant an increasing risk of further offending may not be identified. Acting Chief Constable Colwell added: ""Although we remain in the engage phase for the other two areas identified and recognise there is still work to do, improvements continue at pace."" He said an ""open and honest dialogue"" with HMICFRS would continue, with a ""structured and measured response"" to their findings to deliver ""sustained improvements"". Giving statistical examples of how the force had improved, the force said 96.2% of 999 calls were answered within 10 seconds in December 2023, up by 13.7% compared to the same month in 2022. It said the number of 101 calls abandoned had fallen from 65.2% in June 2023 to 24.8% in December 2023. The force's overall crime recording compliance stood at 87.8% in September 2023, an uplift of 7.5% since 2022, it added. Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

People driving along Gartree Road - between the junction with Shady Lane and the Spire Hospital - hit the hole, which is on a blind bend on Wednesday. A witness said that they had seen about 20 cars damaged by the pothole. Leicestershire County Council told the BBC the hole had been hidden by standing water. A spokesperson from the council said they had been out to the location and had made the site safe with temporary traffic lights. Tim Johnson was on his way to work when he hit the pothole and damaged his car. ""It was pitch black when I hit it, so I couldn't see it. ""I knew straight away that I had done a lot of damage.

""I didn't even bother going through the council that time but this time I will because I'm not paying over a thousand pound worth of damage for something that's not my fault."" The county council said they believed that recent flooding in the East Midlands had also caused the road surface to deteriorate further. A spokesperson said: ""The pothole has been hidden from motorists by standing water.

Barry Smith, 62, from Worcestershire, died from a brain tumour in February 2021, a year after he was diagnosed. On Friday, his wife and daughters will host a festival fundraiser at the Talbot pub, in Belbroughton, near Bromsgrove, hoping to raise money for Brain Tumour Research. ""Dad was a huge personality but became a shadow of himself,"" Lydia Smith said. ""When he died, during lockdown restrictions, we received a huge outpouring of love. ""We knew that when the time was right, we wanted to do something so everybody whose life he touched, has a chance to celebrate him."". As Mr Smith died in lockdown, the family said they were not able to give him a proper send off at the time. People expected at the event include his clients, friends, family and colleagues, they added. Mr Smith was a builder for four decades and in that time he also survived a heart attack and encephalitis, a potentially life-threatening swelling of the brain. He had an operation followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment but his family said his brain tumour continued to grow and affected his mobility. His daughter said, throughout the time, they made him as comfortable as possible and he even made a few trips to the pub. ""Watching dad change in front of our eyes was horrible. I would have given one of my limbs to save him,"" she added. ""Instead, we face a future without him being around to watch me and my sister get married and have a family of our own.""

But co-ordinator Billie Lawler cautioned: ""Sometimes the wording doesn't quite seem to hold true."" Norfolk Trading Standards said such posts ""can be difficult to verify"". In a statement, it said: ""Unfortunately, scammers use a number of tools in their attempts to exploit people. ""This can include using social media platforms to send posts asking for items to support those in need or appearing to be fundraising for charitable causes. ""We know scammers will often create a sense of urgency to take action so people can feel persuaded to contribute quickly and feel they don't have time to check the story."" Ms Lawler, who is Norfolk Community Foundation's co-ordinator for the Nourishing Norfolk Network, said anyone in genuine need of food and help would never be turned away from its food hubs, dotted around the county. She said she feared it would make members of the public less likely to support bona fide causes. Speaking about the suspicious posts, she said: ""You hope that the person, if they are genuine, are going to get the help they need. ""Then there's that frustration that if this isn't genuine, then some lovely people are going to be scammed out of money here, which is heart-breaking."" The Nourishing Norfolk Network runs a membership scheme to offer affordable, healthy food as well as some free items. Although identification was normally required, Ms Lawler said the network ""would never turn our back on someone who has the bravery to walk across the threshold to reach out for help"". ""If they were to tell us that they had fled domestic violence - as in this story - we would take that at face value. ""Any type of help, support and advice that we can offer is given through the food hubs.""

Mr Cager's diagnosis came after he arranged a get-together with friends to discuss their health. ""I said 'let's go for a curry, let's go for a beer and make it a social event, but let's do something positive about our health and get ourselves tested',"" he said.

He underwent a series of tests between January and March last year before a biopsy confirmed he had stage three cancer. A month after he was told, Mr Cager had surgery to have the tumour removed.

There have been more than 20 recent flood warnings in York and businesses, including the York Dungeons attraction, have been forced to close. Beavers build dams which then act as a natural method of slowing down water. City of York Council said ""beavers offer fantastic, natural benefits to flood and drought reduction"". Councillors are set to approve a £5.3m flood alleviation scheme on 17 January but the council's flooding team is also ""open to further measures"" including beaver reintroduction. The council's innovative flood resilience manager, Victoria Murray, said: ""At present, we have no live plans to introduce beavers as part of water level management. ""However, we and partners are open to and continuing conversations about the reintroduction of beavers."" She added that reintroducing beavers to the Ouse would require ""a significant amount of water to be stored across the entire 3,500-sq-km catchment to have an impact"". A spokesperson for the Yorkshire Rewilding Network said that any time a study was done with beavers, a ""big reduction"" in peak flows could be seen. They added: ""So the water obviously comes through but rather than there being a massive spike, it's more rounded."" According to Forestry England, beavers were heavily hunted for their fur and scent glands that produce a substance called castoreum and by the beginning of the 16th Century beavers became extinct in the UK. Dr Rob Stoneman, director of landscape recovery for The Wildlife Trusts, said: ""The first thing I would say is not to introduce beavers in York as it's too close to pumped drainage systems in the lowlands. ""I would start beaver introductions in the upper catchments of the Ouse such as the Dales, and let them spread downstream, so that by the time they got to the drained arable lowlands, beaver co-existence would be weaved into the way we manage land rather than surprise or annoy farmers who fields suddenly flood because a beaver has burrowed through a dyke.

We will never be able to move on and that connection to the site will remain forever."" Her request earned a delay on the decision until Wednesday on whether to refurb the site in Ufton Nervet, but it has now been deferred again. Thames Valley Police's objection raises issues of public safety and policing on the site and echoes concerns and objections raised by residents. The application seeks planning permission for the creation of 17 permanent traveller pitches with car parking spaces, day rooms, and a children's play area. It was vacated in 2020 as the area had become dilapidated and posed health hazards, particularly in relation to drainage. Henry Long, from Mortimer, was arrested at the site and eventually jailed for 16 years. His accomplices Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were each given 13 years. PC Harper was dragged for more than a mile along country lanes in Berkshire after he and a colleague responded to reports of a quad bike theft. The 28-year-old from Wallingford became lassoed to the back of a car after he stepped into the loop of a tow rope as he tried to apprehend one of the defendants. In the aftermath PC Harper's wife Lissie Harper successfully campaigned for Harper's Law to give mandatory life sentences to the killers of emergency service workers.

Nick Harding trained stars of The Boys In The Boat on the Thames by his home town of Marlow, Buckinghamshire. The biographical sports film tells the story of the United States crew during the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics. Mr Harding said the famous director ""wasn't going to put anyone through hard days he wasn't going to do himself"". ""It was a very challenging shoot because when you're trying to do anything on water and you have that many boats to corral and organise - it took a lot of planning,"" he explained. ""I was thinking, 'thank God I don't have to direct this because it's a really difficult thing to do'."" The 63-year-old coach, who grew up in Marlow, retired to the town after spending 30 years as a screenwriter in TV and film. Hollywood contacts asked Mr Harding for advice on filming the essential rowing scenes in the movie. He joined ex-Olympic rowing coach Terry O'Neill and 2016 silver medallist Victoria Thornley in training actors for the Warner Bros film. Mr Harding arranged for Mr Clooney to visit and spend a day with the Oxford rowing team so the star could get a sense of how to shoot pivotal race scenes. ""We were chatting about how to dramatize the racing so it's not too boring, he put a lot of time and energy into thinking how it is shot so it's not dull,"" he said. Although training took place in Marlow, filming took place in Swindon, Henley on Thames and The Queen Mother Reservoir in Berkshire. None of the cast had previous rowing experience. The coach was initially doubtful he could train the performers as ""you'd need nine months to a year to get a novice crew up to speed"". The actors trained twice a day and eventually somewhat matched the achievement of the 1936 team. Mr Harding said: ""In the Olympic final they did 46 strokes a minute, which is really high, the cast got up to the same target."" The film's producers, including Mr Clooney, had been keen to recreate the activity in camera and not use visual effects. ""I'm very proud of them, I've worked with actors a lot but they were an impressive group of actors,"" said the coach. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

It said the move would save £85,000 in the 2024/25 financial year. Deputy council leader Millie Earl said the decision had been ""a difficult one"" and that staff and volunteers were being supported through the process. The nursery in Pokesdown has five full-time staff but closes to the public during the winter months. Staff shut the gates on 5 November with the expectation of reopening in March. But the latest message posted on the nursery's Facebook page said: ""It is with a heavy heart that we announce that the difficult decision has been made to close our plant nursery. We will not open in spring 2024."" Ms Earl said: ""We are aware that it will impact our dedicated staff and volunteers, and we will be supporting them throughout this process.

Ali Carre arranged a collection of a 10kg (1.5 stone) box packed with about 30 gifts from her home in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. She used Royal Mail's Tracked 24 service but the parcel never arrived. Royal Mail apologised for the ""inconvenience and frustration"" she had experienced. The tracking information shows the parcel was collected at 09:08 GMT on 16 December and received at the Midlands Super Hub at 21:58 GMT the same day. This was the last update she received and the parcel was not delivered. The gifts, including jewellery, a Harry Potter game and candles were for her adopted daughter Gemma, her two children, and their pet cat and dog. She received £150 back, plus £5.49 for the cost of postage, which is the maximum compensation offered for Tracked 24 items. The retired doctor, who is a wheelchair user and partially sighted, said she prefers to have items collected rather than go to the post office. Dr Carre said: ""I assumed that as this was with the Royal Mail and tracked, the parcel would be safe. ""I sent the parcel in good faith and there is no mention of the compensation level on the app."" Dr Carre said she was worried her package had been stolen. ""I'm sure a large box of Christmas presents was appealing,"" she added. The complaints team told her said it understood her concerns but levels of internal crime were exceptionally low, and it takes the security of mail seriously. Royal Mail said that ""it can be difficult to investigate and locate a missing item"" due to the ""sheer volume of parcels within our mail centres"". ""We apologise to the customer for the inconvenience and frustration this would have undoubtedly caused,"" a spokesperson said. ""According to our latest published data, three quarters of first-class mail arrives the following day, and 96 per cent within three of posting."" Dr Carre had a similar experience last year when she sent a £40 gift to a friend in a sealed padded envelope with a postage label, again paid for via the app. The package went missing at the Nottingham depot and only a card was delivered. Dr Carre asked in a Freedom of Information request how many parcels go missing ever year, but Royal Mail said it was not obliged to answer because it was no longer government owned. It also refused to answer when the BBC asked the same question. She has now taken her complaint to the Postal Review Panel. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the council's transport cabinet member, said: ""This is about making sure that the residents in this city have better service so they get into the habit of using the bus instead of using a car. ""I think it is absolutely brilliant - it's a long-term plan to encourage people to use these services so that when the government money stops as it will, enough people will be using this to make these services commercial.""

The scripts are expected to sell for between £600 and £800. They were used for the two-part season finale entitled The One With Ross's Wedding. Members of the main cast, including Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer, filmed scenes in England. The unnamed seller had worked at Fountain Studios until 1999 but had kept the scripts in a bedside drawer before having a clear-out. ""I remember wondering which member of the cast they might have belonged to,"" they said. ""When I came to clear my desk I just swept everything  into a big cardboard box. I forgot the scripts were there. ""They ended up in a bedside drawer and they've been there ever since. I could have quite easily have thrown them out. ""These scripts deserve to be owned by a big Friends fan."" They will now will be auctioned on 12 January alongside a production hoodie and a Friends DVD box set. Ms Butler said it is not clear who the scripts belonged to but it would have been somebody within the cast or crew of the TV show. ""There is a sticker for a chap called John Lanzer who is a set designer so they possibly could have been his,"" she said. The head of operations admitted to being a huge Friends fan, adding: ""It's just surreal to read it and see in writing what you've seen on the screen"". She warned that dedicated fans may exceed the estimate auction. ""The sky's the limit, if people want them they will bid for them,"" she said.

While critics mocked its arena battles as mindless play-acting, the fight to get them on screen was a serious business.",2024-01-11,"Returning to screens on Saturday with a high-octane mix of entertainment and athleticism, the BBC will be hoping its Gladiators reboot can replicate the programme's 1990s success. While critics mocked its arena battles as mindless play-acting, the fight to get them on screen was a serious business. ""I'll never forget the moment I heard a 'pop',"" recalls Diane Youdale as she details the fall that left her ""one step too close"" to breaking her neck. Rugby-tackling a contestant at height, the 26-year-old - known to millions of fans as Jet - had smashed down awkwardly on the crash mats below with the challenger's body wrapped around her. ""They stretchered me out and, as I was lying in an ambulance in agony, I thought I'm going to roll away while my limbs still work. I've done my four years, it's time to bow out."" Introduced as ""Gladiators' very own Wonder Woman"" in the programme's first episode, Youdale's backflips and hair flicks saw her win over audiences as she competed against members of the public in a range of physical challenges. ITV's gamble on the new format turned into a Day-Glo phenomenon and became, the childhood gymnastics champion says proudly, ""a Saturday-night ritual"". But the toll was punishing and that injury, inflicted at a non-televised event at Wembley Arena in 1996, proved decisive. Jet's ups and downs mirrored the programme's own journey as, behind the scenes, it had taken an almighty effort to convince commissioning chiefs of its potential and a further struggle to assemble the right team of pumped-up participants. Youdale, who moved to London from Billingham, on Teesside, in the mid-1980s to study dance, remembers working as a ""jobbing actor"" and choreographer. Approached by producers, her place was secured by ""blitzing"" an Army assault course at Woolwich Barracks in early 1992. Familiar with the American version of the programme, she initially believed she was being asked to audition as a contestant and, at 5ft 6ins (1.67m) and 9st 6lbs (60kg), feared being ""beaten up"". ""Those people [on the US show] looked like animals - bodybuilders and very strong wrestler types. There was me - a little dancer! ""LWT (London Weekend Television) didn't have a big pool of people to draw from. They'd scoured magazines and looked at the fitness industry, but back then bodybuilders weren't what we call functional athletes. ""They couldn't run to catch a bus for a million pounds. ""I think it took them two or three years to get it right. They'd cast someone and then realise that person couldn't cut it in the arena, or wasn't popular or good on camera."" First broadcast on ITV on 10 October 1992, along with Blind Date and Beadle's About, and regularly pitched against the ""Gotchas"" and gunge tank of Noel's House Party on BBC One, it was like nothing seen before in that sought-after slot. The Lycra-clad combatants, including Wolf, Warrior, Shadow and Cobra, became household names thanks to their prowess in the likes of Hang Tough and Duel, with challengers traversing an exhausting assault course in the Eliminator showdown. Where the US version was studio-bound with a small audience, producers in the UK envisaged glitz, glamour and atmosphere. Filmed at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, pop classics were employed alongside the G-Force cheerleaders to ""hype up"" the crowds of thousands. LWT director Jonathan Glazier, who joined the programme from the third series, describes it fondly as ""a panto"" with ""something for all the family"". Financial considerations, though, brought plenty of pressure. ""That Saturday slot was hugely important,"" he explains. ""The channels were in a fight for the audience and it was going to be expensive to make."" Often following the sun-soaked Baywatch adventures of Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff, one key to Gladiators' success was that ""people genuinely loved - or loved to hate - the characters"", explains the television critic, Ian Hyland. ""Also, you rooted for the members of the public. Remember, this was back in the days when normal people being on TV was still quite unusual."" While the programme was ""going gangbusters"" by the time Glazier stepped into the director's chair, he reveals the earliest shows required a creative approach. ""At the start, nobody quite knew what it was and so the arena wasn't always full,"" he says. ""You had the wonderful spectacle of moving half the audience from one side to the other [to hide empty seats] and making it all work in the edit. ""People used to make jokes about it being a glorified pillow fight, but if you've ever been on the receiving end of those pugil sticks [used in Duel] you'll understand there's nothing Toytown about it."" As millions watched, Youdale enlisted her mum to handle sacks of fan mail. It was at times an ""uncomfortable"" level of attention. ""Once the show had gone out it was difficult to hide,"" she says. ""But because it was such a positive programme it was never awkward or awful. It could've been very different."" Further tension arrived with annual contract reviews as producers monitored the cast's performance and popularity, while scandals including Shadow being sacked over drug allegations attracted a fierce tabloid spotlight. Help was at hand, though. ""The idea was to keep the ship as happy as possible,"" says Glazier. ""They were regular folk when they came to us. ""The machine of ITV was there to help protect them by managing their personal appearances, and contracts were as level and fair as they could be."" Having exited the stage, Youdale sought a future away from ""the bright lights"", fulfilling an ambition to study counselling and psychotherapy. And with viewing figures falling, Gladiators' final programme was broadcast in January 2000. On the horizon was the reality TV juggernaut that has dominated Saturdays ever since. ""We knew live television was where it was heading,"" says Glazier who is now based in Singapore as executive producer and director of Asia's Got Talent. ""The elimination singing format was perfect for that and it sustained ITV and the BBC for years."" Now, following a short-lived reboot on Sky in 2008-09, the BBC is resurrecting Gladiators with Bradley Walsh and son Barney presenting. Is it fighting a losing battle though? Youdale, who reflects on the 90s incarnation co-hosting the GladPod podcast, is confident it will find an audience. ""The odds are against it [having the same cultural impact] because it was new and we only had four or five channels, but with a prime-time slot it will get the energy it needs,"" she says. ""I'm really excited.""

Southampton City Council is one of the participating authorities in the nationwide scheme. It is run by the Department for Transport (DfT) which has extended its end date from May this year until May 2026. Southampton will need to vote through its own vehicle special orders (VSO) to follow suit. Since the scheme was first introduced in the city in March 2021 the council said there had been more than 1.5 million rides, which it claimed had saved 340 tonnes of CO2. The authority added 42% of respondents of a survey carried out in autumn 2022, who had used an e-scooter, said if they were not available they would have used a private vehicle. However, concerns listed in a council report, include the ""perception that rental e-scooters could be detrimental to community safety: such as litter dropping or congregating at parking areas"" and ""that users will ride on pavements, at speed and otherwise inappropriately"". The council's cabinet is expected to vote in the VSO extension on Tuesday, and will also need to extend its contract with Voi, the e-scooter supplier, before the contract ends in May 2024.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67929755,Boohoo put 'Made in UK' labels on clothes made overseas,"Fast-fashion firm Boohoo put ""Made in the UK"" labels on potentially thousands of clothes that were actually made in South Asia, BBC Panorama has found.",2024-01-11,"Fast-fashion firm Boohoo put ""Made in the UK"" labels on potentially thousands of clothes that were actually made in South Asia, BBC Panorama has found. Plain T-shirts and hoodies had their original labels removed at Boohoo's flagship factory, Thurmaston Lane in Leicester, last year. On Tuesday, the BBC reported that the firm is considering closing the site. Boohoo said the incorrect labels were down to a misinterpretation of the labelling rules. Thurmaston Lane opened two years ago and was promoted by the retailer as a UK manufacturing centre of excellence, offering end-to-end garment production in the UK. The mislabelling took place at the factory, affecting up to one in 250 of Boohoo's global supply of garments between January and October 2023. The BBC estimates that this could amount to hundreds of thousands of wrongly labelled garments. However, the retailer would not provide precise figures. Boohoo claims it was an isolated incident which had happened as ""a result of human error"". A company spokesperson said, ""We have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again."" The garments had been shipped from Pakistan and other countries in South Asia to Boohoo's Leicester factory where they were printed on. The BBC showed its findings to Chris Grayer, who spent more than 10 years as head of supplier ethical compliance at High Street retailer Next. He said the mislabelling suggested that there had been a ""significant failure of inspection"" - and if it had happened where he had worked, ""garments would be recalled or stopped from being sold and all the labels would have to be altered to the correct label"". Sylvia Rook, lead officer for fair trading at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said that based on information provided by Panorama, replacing country-of-origin labels with ""Made in the UK"" ones in this way was ""incorrect"" and ""could potentially mislead consumers"". Philip Dunne MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, called the labelling findings a potentially very serious allegation. ""Consumers should not be misled as to the source of garments that they're buying,"" he said. On Tuesday, the BBC reported that Boohoo is considering the closure of its Leicester factory, which is the Manchester-based retailer's only UK manufacturing site. BBC Panorama understands that the company is proposing to close Thurmaston Lane later this year. Boohoo has previously said the Leicester site would ""showcase UK manufacturing"" and demonstrate that ""great products can be produced responsibly and ethically in the UK"". When Thurmaston Lane was opened in January 2022, it reportedly employed 100 staff. ""The proposed closure is sad for the workers promised sustainable work there,"" said Dominique Muller from the advocacy group, Labour Behind the Label. ""It is also sad because it suggests the Boohoo model of fast and cheap fashion is unsustainable and cannot be made outside countries with extremely low wages and poor social protection."" Boohoo said that it is in a period of consultation with workers, while it considers what to do with the site. ""We opened Thurmaston Lane to support the Group in several ways, as in any retail business, the role of our sites continues to evolve over time,"" a spokesperson said. ""We must now take steps to continue to ensure we are a more efficient, productive and strengthened business."" Boohoo pledged to overhaul its practices in 2020, following reports that staff at a factory making its clothes in Leicester were earning less than the minimum wage, and that working conditions were unsafe. The company asked a senior barrister to review its supply chain. Alison Levitt KC found the allegations to be ""substantially true"". Boohoo then introduced Agenda for Change - which includes promising to pay its suppliers a fair price for garments, with realistic timescales. Boohoo's Broken Promises Fast fashion giant Boohoo faced serious criticism in 2020 for poor working conditions at its suppliers. A Panorama investigation reveals renewed pressure to cut costs. Watch now on BBC iPlayer But in 2023, a BBC Panorama undercover reporter at the company's Manchester HQ saw evidence of staff pressuring suppliers to drive prices down, even after deals had been agreed. The reporter discovered that hundreds of orders placed with Thurmaston Lane were actually being made by seven factories in Morocco and four in Leicester. Secret filming by Panorama at one of these suppliers - MM Leicester Clothing Ltd - revealed staff being told they might have to work late into the night with just hours' notice to get Boohoo's orders completed. After BBC Panorama's investigation, Boohoo said it had ""responsibly disengaged"" from MM Leicester Clothing Ltd ""whilst honouring any outstanding orders"". It said the Thurmaston Lane plans were not related to the BBC Panorama investigation.","['Fashion', 'Clothing industry', 'Boohoo', 'Leicester']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/13858/production/_131606997_boohoo_promo_v3-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8C24/production/_132267853_boohoo_labels_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B34/production/_132263653_2-2012_210923-8.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0253/production/_124659500_generic_banner_top.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2BC/production/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png']",['Panorama Team'],UK,England

Tens of thousands of workers from across the public sector, including teachers, civil servants and bus and train drivers, are walking out on Thursday, 18 January over pay. Unions have billed it as the biggest strike in Northern Ireland's history. The department said it is extremely concerned about the impact on services. It added that it the health system was ""already under sustained and very severe pressure"". All health and social care including hospitals, community care and ambulances will be affected, with some services completely halted. It is appealing to the public to use services appropriately to help ensure care is available to those who need it most. It is also asking people to take all sensible steps to reduce the chances of requiring health service treatment on the day. Some £584m to address public sector pay issues has been offered by the government as part of a financial package of more than £3.3bn for the return of a Northern Ireland Executive. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the dispute could be resolved ""rapidly"" if power sharing returned to Stormont. In a statement, the department said it's ""very aware of the deep frustration"" of health service staff at the ongoing absence of a pay offer for this year. ""Under the current 2023/24 health budget, it has not yet been possible for the department to make a pay offer to HSC (health and social care) staff. ""That situation is neither sustainable nor defensible and cannot hold indefinitely."" Unison, a union which represents thousands of health workers, said it has worked with the department to mitigate disruption. Conor McCarthy, the union's regional organiser, said it is working to ""minimise as much disruption as humanly possible"". ""We have a life and limb policy with regards to cover arrangements - in some occasions it will resort to a Bank Holiday cover arrangement,"" he added. Mr McCarthy said the union is calling for the secretary of state to stop using workers as leverage and resolve the pay dispute. ""Our members are more and more determined - they're becoming more and more angry. ""Unison is repeatedly pressing the secretary of state to stop using health workers as political pawns. ""The secretary of state has fiscal responsibility in the absence of an assembly to ensure public sector workers receive the uplift that was agreed and what they deserve and are long overdue.""

It follows searches of four properties, carried out by the PSNI and UK Border Force, in the north and east of the city on Thursday. Police said the majority of the seized drugs appear to be counterfeit and are labelled as pregabalin tablets. A 34-year-old man has been arrested and is currently being interviewed by police. The PSNI said the 300mg tablets appear to have been imported from outside the European Union and ""bear all the hallmarks of being counterfeit"". That means they are ""not licenced for human consumption in the UK or EU"", PSNI Det Insp Kelly said. Despite their labelling, Det Insp Kelly added, their ""exact content may not be what is described on the packaging"". ""Sadly in recent times a number of people have lost their lives to consumption of medication similar to this or mixing with other medications.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67950025,John Caldwell shooting: Man accused over police shooting 'used fake name',"A man jointly accused of trying to murder a senior police officer used a false name to register a car linked to the shooting, a court has heard.",2024-01-11,"A man jointly accused of trying to murder a senior police officer used a false name to register a car linked to the shooting, a court has heard. Jonathan McGinty is one of seven men accused of the attempted murder of Det Ch Insp John Caldwell last February. The officer was shot in front of his young son in Omagh, County Tyrone. A defence lawyer argued the allegations relating to Mr McGinty, of St Julians Downs in Omagh, were so weak that he had no case to answer. The accused is a 29-year-old car trader who was allegedly involved in ""flipping cars"", according to his defence team. During a bail application at the High Court in Belfast, the prosecution claimed Mr McGinty used the falsely-registered Mercedes saloon car to give a lift to one of his co-accused on the day of the shooting. The court also heard that when questioned by police, Mr McGinty initially claimed he did not have a mobile phone. However, a mobile phone was later found inside a backpack in his kitchen and, in a subsequent search, a second phone was discovered hidden under his mattress. Mr McGinty has refused to provide the PIN codes for either phone, but the court heard one of his phones was inactive between 15:42 GMT and 21:03 GMT on the day of the attack. Det Ch Insp Caldwell was shot at about 20:00 GMT on 22 February 2023, shortly after he had finished coaching a youth football team. Two men dressed in dark, waterproof clothing approached him as he loaded footballs into the boot of his car and opened fire, shooting him repeatedly. The gunmen made their getaway in a Ford Fiesta car, which was discovered on fire later that night. The court heard that two other cars - a second Fiesta and a Mercedes - were allegedly part of the conspiracy to kill the detective. ""In the crudest terms they were the clean-up vehicles,"" a prosecution barrister told the High Court. She claimed Mr McGinty registered the Mercedes C Class to his home address using a false name and brought it into Omagh on 1 February. In early March, the car was swapped for a van, professionally cleaned and then sold on, the court heard. Forensic examinations carried out on the vehicle after the valeting found one indicative particle of potential gun cartridge discharge residue. Prosecutors have claimed, based on CCTV footage, that on the day of the shooting Mr McGinty drove the Mercedes to collect 45-year-old co-accused Gavin Coyle at his home in Killybrack Mews, Omagh. Less than a quarter of an hour after the attack, the same vehicle allegedly arrived at the address of another defendant, 72-year-old James Ivor McLean, at Deverney Park, Omagh. An unidentified witness told police two masked men wearing waterproof suits got out and ran towards a back garden. A short time later the Mercedes left again, followed immediately by a white transit van. Checks have established a total of six C Class saloons were present in the Omagh area on the day of the shooting. However, the judge was told the other five either lacked the same distinctive features or had been eliminated from inquiries for other reasons. Opposing bail, the prosecutor confirmed that the guns used in the attack have not been recovered. ""One of the weapons in this case was used previously in relation to shootings on properties,"" she added. In addition to the attempted murder charge, Mr McGinty faces a further charge of preparation of terrorist acts. But his defence barrister Karl McGuckin insisted the prosecution was based on his client's alleged association with other suspects. He argued it was almost impossible to identify the type of vehicle in some of the CCTV clips. ""The prosecution is seeking to use other actors and the fact that (McGinty) knows them as a means of discolouring this and making it look more suspicious than it is,"" Mr McGuckin said. ""We are being asked to build a house in the sand."" When asked about claims that Mr McGinty registered the Mercedes in a fake name, he responded: ""My understanding is that he's involved in flipping cars and in doing that saves on tax. ""It isn't the crime of the century."" The judge adjourned the bail application, saying he wanted to study the footage and expert reports before giving a decision.","['Omagh', 'Police Service of Northern Ireland']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F373/production/_128832326_0f7fbb8d-eb7f-4d14-aee8-ea589d793fee.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/06B0/production/_128721710_youthsport.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,N.

The latest cancer waiting time figures in Northern Ireland show continued delays in cancer treatments across the system. Kathy McAllister, 53, was diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer in 2019. She says it has become normal to accept the statistics will be worse, but nothing is being done to change them. ""There are lots of people running out of time who can't wait and it's now time for people to say that something has to be done,"" Ms McAllister told BBC News NI. ""It feels like the figures are like wallpaper - on hearing them we just become numb, and we stop thinking that there are real people behind them."" Ms McAllister said some friends had their diagnoses delayed for so long that the outlook changed from treatable to terminal. ""Things need to be improved for all cancer patients so we just don't keep hearing every quarter that the figures have become worse,"" Ms McAllister added. Cancer waiting times released by the Department of Health on Thursday morning show continued delays across the system. The latest figures showed that in the three months ending September 2023, just 34% of patients starting treatment for cancer did so within the target 62 days of a GP referral, a fall of more than five percentage points on the same period in 2022. And just over half (52.9%) of those breast cancer patients who received an urgent referral were seen within their 14-day target period, down from 70.2% in the previous quarter and 63.2% in the same period in 2022. During her treatment, Ms McAllister undertook chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. She also receives routine scans annually. However, she said waiting at every stage was almost as bad as going through treatment. ""[There is] waiting to hear your diagnosis, waiting to hear the results, waiting to hear if you are treatable, waiting to have a follow-up appointment,"" she said. Each stage takes its toll mentally and physically, she added, as longer waits can allow the cancer to grow. ""Treatable to terminal is the difference between life and death,"" Ms McAllister said. The devolved government at Stormont collapsed almost two years ago after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements. In the absence of local government, Ms McAllister called for the formation of an urgent cancer taskforce so departments can come together to make the most of the resources available. She said that the pandemic proved that the health service can pull together quickly that there was a sense of ""urgency"" but that same urgency is not being applied to cancer. And urgency can make a huge difference in a person's story. For eight years, Claire Scott experienced frequent pains in her chest which could never be attributed to anything. She brushed them off until 2018, when she experienced sudden bouts of nausea and went to her GP. Within days, her liver was found to be functioning poorly and she was told to attend Londonderry's Altnagelvin Hospital. A large tumour was discovered and she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the age of 27. ""Two of my grandparents have passed due to pancreatic cancer - that was the only thing I knew about it,"" she told BBC News NI. ""It was just one of those things where you get it, and as we all know if anyone's had pancreatic cancer, it's very serious and survival rates are low."" However, Ms Scott remained optimistic and received surgery to remove her pancreas just weeks after her initial diagnosis. ""For me, from when I first presented to A&E to when I had surgery was less than three weeks so incredibly lucky, incredibly different to a lot of people's cases,"" she added. ""While I had symptoms for years and years, once I got red-flagged I was progressed very quickly through the system and I was able to make a relatively full recovery."" Six years after her diagnosis, Ms Scott takes medication daily to help manage the after-effects of her condition. She says some cancers are harder to spot than others - part of why they can be less survivable. ""Pancreatic cancer doesn't present itself in symptoms,"" she said. ""Typically what happens is that it spreads somewhere else and that flags it to people."" Accessing the right diagnostic tools as well as proper access to GPs is also important for catching cancers early before they cause devastating effects, Ms Scott added. ""I find sometimes cancer and these less survivable cancers, it's a bit of a taboo, it's a foregone conclusion, it's around palliative care when that's not actually the case. ""It's maybe shifting the conversation to if we can intervene earlier… that would go a huge way in support people with less survivable cancers.""","['NI Health', 'Bowel cancer', 'Cancer']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/182E2/production/_129024099_gettyimages-1208522845.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/434B/production/_132272271_3b91a550-2ef9-4853-95f7-376b90bb3fc0_upload.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DF8B/production/_132272275_clairescott.jpg']","['Marie-Louise Connolly', 'Jessica Lawrence']",UK,N.

Michael Madden, who represents 20 sub-postmasters in Northern Ireland, said he had been approached by at least six more this week alone. More than 900 people were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Some people went to prison for false accounting and theft, while others were financially ruined by the scandal. The controversy has been catapulted back into the spotlight by the ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which was broadcast last week. On Wednesday Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the government would bring in a new law to ""swiftly"" exonerate and compensate victims. He was addressing the scandal in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions. The law will not automatically apply in Northern Ireland or Scotland, but Postal Affairs Minister Kevin Hollinrake said that Downing Street was ""keen"" to extend the provisions. The courts system in Northern Ireland is different from England and Wales. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 700 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses based on data from faulty Horizon software. Some 283 more cases were brought by other bodies including the Crown Prosecution Service. A public inquiry into the scandal began in February 2021 and was due to resume again on Thursday after breaking for Christmas. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme, Mr Madden said the response since the programme aired had been unbelievable. ""Even in the last week I have had a number of people come forward and contact me... there have been at least half a dozen that have come forward,"" he said. ""I had one lady in particular which I am very confident has a very strong application to the Court of Appeal and potentially to this new scheme proposed. ""Even after years and years of these cases going to the court, people who have very good cases are only coming forward now."" ""It's about time and it's great that people now are getting the courage and confidence to come forward and get their reputations restored since the drama."" Mr Madden said the drama had catapulted the scandal back into public consciousness and highlighted the devastation that it had caused to so many people.","['Post Office Inquiry', 'Post Office Ltd', 'ITV']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E277/production/_132257975_gettyimages-1917790465-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6D2B/production/_132274972_michelmadden!.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D9D8/production/_132186755_mr_bates_vs_the_post_office_02.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,N.

Fr Patrick McCafferty was speaking after Kevin Conway was killed on Tuesday night. The 26-year-old was on bail after being charged with involvement in the January 2023 murder of Shane Whitla in Lurgan. This was a shooting linked to an organised crime gang known as The Firm. Tuesday's gun attack is one of series of killings linked to drugs and wider criminality in west and north Belfast over the last decade or so. In a statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said these were ""extremely complex investigations and we have made arrests in a relation to a number of cases"". Fr McCafferty, who is based in Ballymurphy in west Belfast, said more needs to be done to bring those responsible to justice. ""I suppose the whole business is that this is happening in a small community, that the forces of law and order seem to be unable or unwilling to do anything about it,"" he told BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme. ""To solve these murders, to arrest those responsible for them and to dismantle, if you like, the apparatus of these drug lords and these organisations that are dealing in drugs and killing young people, killing people."" He said he understood there is a ""culture because of the Troubles and the nature of the Troubles, that people are unwilling, afraid to speak to the police"". ""Not as bad maybe as it used to be, [but] there is a legacy there."" Fr McCafferty also said he had sympathy with the complexity of investigations but that ""from the point of view of the people in the community, people on the ground, it's an incredible situation that after 10, 15 years, there hasn't been a single person made accountable and put behind bars"". He added: ""We have to trust the police, and we do, but at the same time a society where this happens with impunity is not a healthy society."" What we have seen in areas of north and west Belfast, in a period of about 11 years, is 17 murders where there are similarities. Similarities in the method of execution and the brutality but also because in the overwhelming majority, there has been a failure to successfully bring prosecutions. Now, the police would not see these cases as being over and there have been arrests. In one, the shooting of Robbie Lawlor, there are people before the courts albeit not at trial or conviction stage. They would also say they have had success in pursuing cases in similar gun murders outside Belfast. But we are talking about a large number of killings in similar circumstances in a relatively small area, where the police have had, to put it mildly, difficulty in mounting prosecutions. These are complicated cases. There is a degree of sophistication from the perpetrators, who are often well-planned, methodical and forensically aware. There can also be the suspected involvement of dissident republican groups. So there are difficulties in gathering evidence and in communities coming forward with information, which makes solving these crimes a challenge. In a statement on Thursday, Det Ch Supt Eamonn Corrigan, the PSNI's head of serious crime, said detectives are ""investigating the horrific murder of Kevin Conway and a number of other firearms-enabled murders in Belfast"". ""These are extremely complex investigations and we have made arrests in relation to a number of cases,"" he added. ""Whilst not connected to the murder of Mr Conway, there have been charges in relation to the murders of Liam Christie in 2022, Malcolm McKeown in 2019, Robbie Lawlor in 2020 and a number of people convicted for the fatal shooting of Paul Smyth in 2019."" Mr Corrigan said its investigation into the murder of Mr Conway is at an early stage, and appealed to anyone who was in the Greenan area on Tuesday evening who noticed anything suspicious, to contact the PSNI. He added: ""We are absolutely committed to bringing Mr Conway's killers to justice, but ultimately we need the community to work with us and come forward to tell police what they know about the people who carry out these heinous murders. ""We need evidence in order to successfully prosecute and it is by working together that we can obtain better outcomes. I appreciate that can be difficult for some people but there are many avenues available to report information including anonymously to Crimestoppers.""","['Belfast', 'Police Service of Northern Ireland']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14D8F/production/_131519358_ni-joneill-ncc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A916/production/_132268234_belfastforensic.png']",['N/A'],UK,N.

John Roche, 40, was last seen walking towards the quayside in his home town in County Wicklow in December 2012. His body was discovered off Ramsey's coast four months later but could not be identified. An inquest at Douglas Courthouse heard his family had responded to a 2019 TV appeal for DNA to track missing people. Using a sample from his son, forensic scientists were able to identify Mr Roche, who had been recorded as missing in Ireland. Statements read to the court showed he suffered with poor mental health and was a heavy drinker. He had last been seen walking towards the quayside in the late afternoon on 20 December 2012. Coroner James Brooks said he was satisfied the 40-year-old must have entered the water and died on the same day. However he said he was unable to make any factual findings that his death was either intentional or accidental. The inquest heard the body showed signs of an injury to the head, but it was not possible to determine how or when that may have occurred. Mr Brooks said tidal currents had carried Mr Roche's body to the Isle of Man over time, where he was eventually found nearly four months later on 13 April 2013. A inquest was originally opened in 2014 and he was buried at Lonan Church unidentified in April that year. Douglas Courthouse heard, following the identification of Mr Roche, his body was repatriated to his home town in December last year. Recording an open verdict, Mr Brooks passed on his condolences to members of Mr Roche's family, who had travelled to the island for the hearing at Douglas Courthouse. The inquest's conclusion had shown the ""the power of scientific evidence"" and he hoped the process would now help them to ""move on"", he added. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

It follows an appeal over the rejection of Noelle McAleenon's bid for a judicial review on how smells from the site at Mullaghglass were managed. The site stopped accepting waste in November 2022 and was closed in Spring 2023. Local people claimed smells from the site affected their health. The legal team behind the appeal says it is the first time an environmental case of this kind from Northern Ireland has been brought to the Supreme Court. Harry Robinson from Phoenix Law said the case went beyond legal technicalities. ""It's about local people affected by pollution who are seeking justice and it raises broader questions about environmental protection, public decision-making, and the rights of individuals impacted by harmful emissions,"" he said. Ms McAleenon's application for judicial review was dismissed in 2022 by judges who said it had ""no further utility"", given the site was to be closed. She contended that the Court of Appeal misjudged her situation by suggesting alternative remedies were available to address the regulatory oversight of Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council and Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) in response to pollution. Instead, she asserts that her human rights require immediate protection from the various public authorities. The Mullaghglass site was originally a quarry and operated as a landfill site from 2006 to 2023. The managing company says it has now been capped and is in the process of being restored for wildlife. While the site is in the Lisburn and Castlereagh council area, residents in Belfast also took legal action against their council.

General surgery incorporates two strands - emergency general surgery, focusing on complicated/urgent cases, and cases of a less serious nature. BBC News NI understands various options are being discussed, including consolidating emergency general surgery on a single hospital site. This would be either Antrim Area or Causeway Hospital. At present, both the Antrim Area and Causeway hospitals perform the surgery, which includes elective gall bladder surgery, and hernia and bowel repairs. The move is part of the Northern Trust's bigger plan to reshape its general surgery model. This does not affect the Emergency Departments (EDs) at either hospital. In a statement, the trust said that following the Department of Health's 2022 Review of General Surgery in Northern Ireland, it was starting to engage with staff in relation to the provision of general surgery within the trust. It said ""engagement is at a very early stage"" as it starts to consider options and that any proposed change would be subject to public consultation. Earlier this week the Department of Health confirmed that emergency general surgery will be permanently moved from Daisy Hill Hospital to Craigavon. The surgery service was temporarily withdrawn from Daisy Hill in Newry in February 2022 due to surgeon recruitment challenges. The move was opposed by local people in Daisy Hill, including some politicians. According to the Department of Health, an average of three patients a day have been directed to Craigavon from Daisy Hill for emergency general surgery. The department's permanent secretary, Peter May, said the move ""reflects the reality that all hospitals cannot provide all services"". It's understood there are similar staffing challenges in the Northern Health Trust. New departmental standards for emergency and elective general surgery (non-emergency) with the current staff cannot be met. Northern Ireland is experiencing workforce challenges across almost all specialities, which is driving forward consolidation of specialist services on fewer hospital sites. Instead of being in a crisis situation where change is forced upon a service due to safety reasons, the preferred option is to plan for change. While it means some people may have to travel further for surgery, the department argues that surgical hubs in one location means people should be seen quicker and by specialist staff who are spread across several hospital sites. The Northern trust said it remains committed to maintaining acute services and ED at Causeway and is excited to explore how the hospital can develop and thrive. This is transformation of Northern Ireland's health service in action. While that's significant in itself, it's even more so without a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. In fact, without local government and political opposition, some of the health trusts have been ploughing ahead with changing where and how services are delivered. In the past 18 months, a new consultant-led minor injury unit opened at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, replacing units at Newtownards and Bangor community hospitals. Amid public opposition to the move, the trust's plans were the subject of a 12-week public consultation. Last year the Northern Trust moved all hospital births to Antrim Area Hospital, as opposed to maternity services being split across Antrim and the Causeway sites. There was the withdrawal of emergency general surgery at Daisy Hill Hospital to Craigavon. Daisy Hill maintains its Emergency Department. Last year the Northern trust also said it was committed to maintaining acute services and an emergency department at Causeway. According to health trust management and the Royal College of Surgeons, it is driven by ensuring patients are safe and staff are working in a safe environment.",['NI Health'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5751/production/_128435322_gettyimages-1366551169.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10CB1/production/_127258786_87517564-70b1-4277-b036-960a228fc09b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2B61/production/_130550111_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2B61/production/_130550111_grey_line-nc.png']",['Marie-Louise Connolly'],UK,N.

It is a fossil-free alternative to diesel and can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% per vehicle. The move was part of the council's transition to net zero. In June 2021 councillors agreed a climate fund of £1m towards internal projects to support the city's transition to net zero by 2050. Lord Mayor of Belfast Ryan Murphy said the transition was about living up to the council's commitment to face the climate crisis head on. ""We felt getting rid of some of our diesel vehicles would help reduce carbon emissions,"" he said. ""And it has helped - we have seen through estimates that we've saved around 2,000 tons of emissions from going out into the atmosphere because of it."" Other councils across Northern Ireland have also said they are now trialling the fuel. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council is currently conducting a pilot focusing on five vehicles previously powered by diesel. Head of waste management at the council Sinead McEvoy said it has set a target of having a net zero fleet by 2031 and the council has been exploring a range of alternative fuels. ""HVO fuel is around 50p more per litre than normal road diesel,"" she said. ""Obviously there is a higher cost in terms of what you pay at the pump - but the cost of climate action needs to be seen in the context of the benefit. ""There is a 90% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per vehicle whilst we are using it - and we have also been exploring the use of electric cars and hydrogen and bio methane."" So is HVO fuel something that all consumers can adopt at the moment? Head of Energy at the Consumer Council of Northern Ireland, Richard Williams, said HVO is seen as a replacement for diesel. ""It's a got a number of benefits to it,"" he said. ""It can be put straight into a diesel engine and it produces 90% less emissions than normal diesel would. ""It also doesn't affect the actual running of the engine, so the performance is still the same."" ""HVO is particularly suitable for use in things like bin lorries but for the average motorist it's probably not the way forward at the moment. ""The biggest problem is the price - it costs considerably more than diesel. ""It's also about availability to the average motorist. You can't just go up to a forecourt and get it. ""It's delivered in bulk - so organisations  can use it for their lorries at a depo and store it in bulk - so it's good for them and their green credentials."" The Department for the Economy (DfE) said there is currently no large-scale production of HVO in Northern Ireland, meaning it relies upon imports from GB and elsewhere. It said global supplies of biofuel are forecast to increase but several different sectors will compete for these. Nichola Mallon, head of trade and devolved policy at Logistics UK, said a number of her members have trialled and adopted HVO fuel as a transitionary step to reduce emissions. ""The big barrier is the difference in price between HVO and diesel - you can spend up to 10% more and it's not viable for many logistics businesses who are already operating under very tight profit margins."" she said. ""Logistics UK is pressing government to incentivise the adoption of HVO and other low carbon fuels through the tax system to make them more accessible. ""We are also calling for a long-term plan from government on the use of all low carbon fuels to help provide confidence on their use to our members.""","['Net zero', 'Belfast City Council']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C5A3/production/_132259505_binlorries.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/161E3/production/_132259509_mallon.jpg']",['Bernadette Allen'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67939995,Cost of Thursday 18 January strike estimated at £10m,"Unions from across the public sector are taking strike action next Thursday which will impact healthcare, education and public transport among other services.",2024-01-11,"Unions from across the public sector are taking strike action next Thursday which will impact healthcare, education and public transport among other services. Tens of thousands of workers will not be in work, so what impact will this have on the Northern Ireland economy? One economist estimates losses of more than £10m. Dr Esmond Birnie said December's transport strikes cost businesses several million pounds each day. However, the senior economist at Ulster University's Business School said the impact of that disruption was much more acutely felt by two sectors, retail and hospitality, as Christmas shoppers and partygoers cancelled their plans. Four days of strike action by Translink workers across three weekends in December led to lost sales that business owners told BBC News NI they were unlikely to get back. A Thursday in January, however, won't have the same impact on those sectors as it's a quieter time for both. Next week's action is much more weighted towards the public sector including healthcare and education. Dr Birnie said: ""The output of those two sectors on a daily basis, their contribution to the Northern Ireland economy is normally £30m a day."" ""So if output fell by a third, you'd be talking about an economic loss of £10m, but over and above that there will be disruption in other parts of the economy because of reduced availability in public transport and so forth."" Gerry Murphy, assistant general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said that ""one day of disruption is a price worth paying to get the money into the pockets of the these vital public services"". Mr Murphy said there would be a number of large-scale demonstrations across Northern Ireland on the day of the strikes. He told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the demonstrations in Belfast, Londonderry, Omagh, Enniskillen, Magherafelt, and Cookstown would all take place at around lunchtime on 18 January. Mr Murphy said that the numbers taking part ""are going to be the largest we have seen on the streets on behalf of the trade union movement in a generation"". Tens of thousands of workers who are out at picket lines will not be paid or will receive a lower level of pay which will be a direct impact. But there will also be the indirect impact of people who cannot get to work because of childcare or the lack of public transport. ""It's a ripple effect of disruption,"" Dr Birnie said. ""Of course people have great concerns about the cost of living and living standards but that needs to be crucially weighed against the fact that there's a lot of collateral damage in having such generalised strikes and the impact on the general public."" It's hard to put an exact figure on the cost of next week's strike, he added, as the total output lost can only be estimated. ""It looks as though that could be more than £10m on 18 January but in a sense that probably underestimates the totality of the disruption and loss of wellbeing to the general public,"" he added.","['NI economy', 'Strike action']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AEB7/production/_132272744_pacemaker15-12-23transportstrike014.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BCB/production/_132272279_2791eb511dd0ff9c6f0db1053f6312e60f82d431.jpg']",['Clodagh Rice'],UK,N.

That was 24-year-old Stephen Blakely's reaction to getting a stoma bag, He has now started to document his experience of living with a stoma on social media in a bid to bust myths and tackle stigma. Stephen, from Londonderry, became unwell in the summer of 2022, bleeding when going to the toilet and suffering severe pain. That year he underwent an ileostomy and now uses a stoma bag to collect waste products. He hopes his TikTok videos will help those with similar symptoms overcome any fear of getting help. ""For me, whenever I got a stoma bag you always hear the myths and the rumours - there are plenty of them,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. ""People thinking you are going to smell. That's a terrifying thing to go through. ""That was my most terrifying fear. I lay awake about that for days at a time, that I would go outside and people would think: 'There's an odour or smell coming off him.' ""That's never happened me once with a stoma bag - it's very important that I get that across"". Stephen has ulcerative colitis, a condition where the colon and rectum become inflamed. ""I was going to the toilet 10 to 12 times a day at that time. I was in excruciating pain constantly,"" he said. The ileostomy means he now lives with a stoma - an opening on the abdomen which connects to the digestive or urinary system and allows waste to be diverted out of the body and into a bag. ""It doesn't have to be a bag for life - it can be a bag for living,"" he said. Stephen, who was active and healthy before he became sick, said he began to feel isolated after the surgery. When he left hospital he was visited regularly by specialist nurses but those visits became less frequent. ""You are left dealing with it, struggling on your own. You have no-one else that can understand what you are going through - I didn't know anyone with a bag when I got it,"" he said. He said he went into ""a hole"" for two years while he tried to come to terms with how life had changed. Things are better now. He still struggles at times, but he's socialising again, going out more often. He hopes his social media content will help others come to terms with life with a stoma and encourage anyone who is unwell to get help. ""Since I made the TikTok account I have had people reaching out and contacting me. There's more people than you would know with a stoma bag,"" Stephen said. ""If you are going through pain or bleeding, go and get checked out. It literally takes five minutes and could save your life. ""There's nothing a doctor or nurse hasn't seen before. Yours isn't the first backside they have seen.""","['NI Health', 'Disability', 'Londonderry-Derry', 'Foyle and West']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B85/production/_132271753_stephen.jpg'],['Áine McGlinchey'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67884322,The key NHS targets that have never been met,"Most key NHS targets have been missed for at least seven years across the UK, BBC News research shows.",2024-01-11,"Most key NHS targets have been missed for at least seven years across the UK, BBC News research shows. The review of records going back 20 years also reveals Northern Ireland and Wales have never met the four-hour accident-and-emergency (A&E) target. The analysis focused on the three key hospital targets, covering A&E, cancer and waiting times for planned care. Combined, the length of time during which the targets have been missed tops 100 years. In the past seven, the only one to have been met is the A&E target in Scotland - and that was during lockdown in 2020, when the number of visits to A&E plummeted. All four nations said improving waiting times was a priority and investment was being made. But in an exclusive interview with the BBC, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said not enough was being done. He highlighted the disproportionate number of children on the waiting list - and unveiled a new pledge that no child will wait longer than the target time of 18 weeks for hospital treatment if he were elected prime minister. He said it was ""shocking"" that so many children - more than 180,000 - were waiting longer than 18 weeks. ""Most people across the country would assume children are the priority. Long waits impair their mental and physical development,"" Sir Keir added. Currently there is no separate target for children and to hit the overall target 92% of patients need to be seen in 18 weeks. Sir Keir said under his plan there would be no wriggle room. The comments came as Labour unveiled its child health action plan with the vision of creating the ""healthiest generation of children ever"". To ensure this happens, the party has proposed a ban on junk food advertising, more breakfast clubs in primary schools and supervised teeth-brushing for young children. King's Fund think tank chief analyst Siva Anandaciva said the findings of the BBC analysis should ""act as a wake-up call"". ""These are the key totemic targets,"" he said. ""The length of time they have been missed is incredible."" Patients groups warned the delays were putting patients at risk. Patients Association chief executive Rachel Power said the analysis showed the NHS was in ""permacrisis"". ""The health of many deteriorates while they await treatment and their problems become more complex,"" she said. Kate Seymour, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""The impact this is having on people living with cancer, their families and friends is nothing short of heartbreaking. They deserve better."" British Medical Association leader Prof Philip Banfield said the figures showed the ""dire decline"" of the NHS during the years of austerity. Services were ""stretched beyond their limits"" across the UK, he said. ""Front-line staff are unable to provide the care they've trained so hard to undertake and that patients so desperately need,"" Prof Banfield added. Whether waiting in A&E or for cancer care to begin or an operation, the impact of significant delays on patients is immense. Ian Binns waited four months for cancer treatment for bowel cancer - twice as long as he should have. During this time the 66-year-old, from Nottingham, went from stage one to late stage four. He described the wait as the ""worst time of my life"". ""I would wake up every morning wondering if I had a future."" His cancer is now incurable as it has spread. ""Our greatest tools are rapid diagnosis and timely treatment. Where was the help when I needed it?"" David Corbitt's wait did not have such a devastating effect. But he still described the experience as awful when he went to A&E because of concerns over a potential heart problem. He was advised by an out-of-hours GP to seek help after feeling unwell - he was light-headed and was struggling with his coordination. The 66-year-old, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, got a friend to drive him straight to hospital. ""I hadn't been to an A&E unit for a few years and I was surprised how busy it was. There were people everywhere. ""It was an evening and I spent 13 hours - the whole night - sitting there on a chair before I was seen. It was awful."" He eventually underwent tests and was discharged home. ""The staff were doing their best, but there was not enough of them. It should not be like this, he added."" The Department of Health in Northern Ireland acknowledged the waiting times were ""unacceptable"" and work was under way to tackle them. But it said significant progress would require sustained additional investment and the lack of a devolved government meant it was unable to plan for the long-term. A Welsh government spokeswoman said extra money was being invested, adding: ""We have placed a clear focus on those patients with an urgent need and who have waited the longest."" A spokeswoman for NHS England said progress was being made, with the numbers facing really long waits falling and signs the NHS was coping better this winter than last. The latest figures released on Thursday supported this, showing A&E waits were slightly better than this time last year, while the waiting list has dropped for a second month in a row. But both are a long way from meeting the targets. Labour, which is in power in Wales, has promised it will achieve the key waiting time targets in England by the end of the next parliament if it wins the election. The three targets were all rolled out during the 2000s and have been used to track performance ever since. Each nation decides how they are measured. The four-hour A&E target is similar between each - but there are significant differences for planned hospital treatment. For example, in England it is meant to be within 18 weeks of a referral 92% of the time - and that covers everything from knee and hip operations for which patients are admitted through to outpatient appointments. In Northern Ireland, the target is 13 weeks 55% of the time - but that is just for patients who need to be admitted. Have you experienced long waits for treatment?

BBC News Northern Ireland confirmed that the launch of the extended programme will begin on 15 January. A half-hour breakfast programme initially replaced Radio Foyle's previous two-hour programme in 2023 as part of schedule and programme changes. The changes to the Foyle breakfast programme sparked protests from some politicians and community leaders in the north west. Some assembly members had previously expressed concerns that cuts to programmes on Foyle would turn it into ""BBC Greater Belfast"".

The figure from the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) show growth was driven almost entirely by the services sector. Services output was up by 1.5% over the quarter with growth in all the main services sub-sectors. Northern Ireland's economy is now 6.2% bigger than it was before the pandemic. Nisra said the improved performance in the third quarter came against the backdrop of declining inflation. It added that challenging conditions remain for households and businesses that are ""adjusting to the upward shift in price levels for goods and services and the higher interest rate environment"". More recent industry surveys, such as the Ulster Bank's monthly survey, suggest that companies have faced a worsening business environment since the end of the summer. The Nisra figures also suggest the Northern Ireland economy may have been performing better than the UK average. However, that comes with a significant caveat as the UK and NI figures are not fully comparable. The figures show that from the end of 2019 until the third quarter of 2023 the output of the UK economy expanded by 1.5% while in NI the growth was 6.2%. Some analysis has suggested that NI's post-Brexit deal, which gives it continuing privileged access to the EU single market for goods, has helped its economic performance compared to the rest of the UK.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67945208,Crown faces questions over Post Office prosecutions in Scotland,Scotland's Crown Office is facing questions over its role in the wrongful prosecution of sub-postmasters during the Horizon scandal.,2024-01-11,"Scotland's Crown Office is facing questions over its role in the wrongful prosecution of sub-postmasters during the Horizon scandal. More than 700 sub-postmasters in the UK were wrongly accused of embezzling money due to faulty software. Prosecutors in Scotland were told of issues with evidence in 2013, but did not stop pursuing cases until 2015. Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC could be called to Holyrood to explain why concerns were not disclosed sooner. Up to 100 people in Scotland could have been wrongly accused while working as Post Office branch managers. It was confirmed on Thursday afternoon that a further two of them - Judith Smith and Colin Smith - have had their convictions overturned, bringing the total number in Scotland to four. Ms Smith had been admonished after she pled guilty to a charge of fraud in 2009 at Selkirk Sheriff Court. Her case, along with a number of others, was later highlighted by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission as potentially being a wrongful conviction. Her lawyer, Greg Cunningham, said Ms Smith was a ""wonderful mixture of delighted and relieved"" to finally have her conviction quashed. He added: ""She said to me she has spent the last 16 years living with a cloud over her. ""As much as we in Britain like to talk about the presumption of innocence, when you are accused of robbing from your friends, your family and your local community it doesn't really count for much."" Mr Smith - who is not believed to be related to Ms Smith - was ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty at Dunfermline Sheriff Court in 2013 to one charge of embezzlement. More than 90 convictions have been quashed across the UK as a whole, with the prime minister saying on Wednesday that he would introduce to a new law to exonerate everyone who had been convicted in England and Wales. First Minister Humza Yousaf has pledged that all victims of the scandal in Scotland will also have their convictions overturned. He wants to use a legislative consent motion (LCM) to allow the UK government's new law to also apply north of the border. Responding to Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross at First Minister's Questions, he said sub-postmasters ""should not have to wait any longer for justice"". In England, the Post Office acted as prosecutor during cases between 1999 and 2015, but in Scotland all were handled by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). Mr Yousaf said the COPFS was informed about concerns with Horizon in September 2013, adding it was instructed to treat each case on an individual basis. However, Mr Ross said prosecutors were actually told on 29 January of that year, before being told not to proceed with any cases dependent on accounts from the software designed by tech giant Fujitsu. In a previous response to a freedom of information request from the BBC, the COPFS said it was informed of possible issues in May 2013. Cases were then dropped where Horizon records provided the ""sufficiency of evidence"" in 2015. Mr Ross described the scandal as a ""horrendous miscarriage of justice,"" while Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it was a ""national disgrace"". Mr Yousaf said the Lord Advocate would be willing to consider a briefing or statement to the chamber, but added she was ""very confident"" about its response. He said: ""There are legitimate questions to ask of the Crown. ""The Crown Office were assured by the Post Office and their legal representatives that issues that arose with the Horizon system in England did not impact on any live Scottish cases."" He added: ""When I spoke to the Lord Advocate this morning, she was more than happy to consider whether it was a briefing, whether it was a ministerial statement - she was willing to consider that. ""It will be for her to determine in her independent function as head of the prosecution service in terms of how she should answer of those questions."" A COPFS spokesperson said it had ""raised a discrepancy"" with the Post Office public inquiry over the January date. It said it had been made aware of the case in question in May 2013 and it was resolved in August the following year. They added: ""The Lord Advocate is willing to make a statement to the Scottish Parliament on the Horizon IT prosecutions. ""She hopes to come to an agreement with parliamentary authorities about the timing of this at the earliest possible opportunity."" The Horizon scandal has been public knowledge for years with an inquiry ongoing, but the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. More than 700 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted across the UK during a 16-year period. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced plans to introduce a new law that will quash convictions in England and Wales on Wednesday. Mr Yousaf wants that to apply in Scotland, but needs an LCM to do that. He said that would be pursued, but gave no time frame on when a decision would be made. It comes after a leading lawyer representing 180 sub-postmasters affected by the scandal warned Scotland was moving too slowly when it came to identifying victims. David Enright, a solicitor with Howe and Co, told BBC Radio Scotland the country was ""lagging far behind"" England and Wales in finding those affected by the scandal. Mr Yousaf said the Scottish government would explore ""all options"" to ensure victims entitled to compensation received it. He said: ""It should not have taken a TV drama for action to have to be taken. ""There are a number of complexities to navigate [with the LCM] but what is absolutely certain is that if you are in Scotland or any other part of the UK and have been affected by this is that sub-postmasters have waited far too long for justice, they should not have to wait a moment longer.""","['Post Office Inquiry', 'Humza Yousaf', 'Post Office Ltd', 'Douglas Ross']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6E6B/production/_132276282_39c84f050df313b7a2333c39e0085c53183b1f0b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E39B/production/_132276285_dcdb204ece27a0160ff77a158266d305bd03e975.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6AFB/production/_132278372_d8e3f6b0837e0752b07ed841c51ddb7c1af9e8f8.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-67934473,The fight for the future of Rosefield Mills in Dumfries,The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon.,2024-01-11,"The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon. It was bought - to save it from total dereliction - by Dumfries Historic Buildings Trust (DHBT) in 2018. Since then, the group has been working at bringing parts of it back into use while looking at what the long-term future might hold. After more than five years - and a global pandemic - what stage has the project now reached? Richard Polley volunteers with the DHBT and said he was in no doubt that the property had been worth saving. ""I think it's an incredibly beautiful building,"" he said. ""The design is based on that of a Venetian palace - so I kind of now think of Dumfries as being the Venice of south-west Scotland. ""It's a huge building and was once one of five mills that were along the river in this part of Dumfries and this is now the only remaining part of that story."" He said it was designed to look beautiful on the river front but utilitarian behind that frontage. ""I think it's just so important not to lose that story of the mills in Dumfries that were a significant part of the prosperity of Dumfries and, of course, generated loads of employment here in the town,"" he said. ""This part of Dumfries would have been a real industrial centre and there's the potential to enliven it and to people it and make it part of the regeneration of Dumfries."" However, he admitted that it would take ""several million pounds"" to bring it back into full use but said the DHBT had plans for bringing it back into operation a little at a time. ""It's no good having a fancy scheme that costs so much to maintain and to operate - it has to be something that's sustainable,"" he explained. Luke Moloney, who chairs the trust, said they had made progress since buying the building, having gained support from a range of organisations. A workshop has been brought into use at the back of the building and two new spaces are now open for community or commercial uses. He accepts, however, that there is much more to be done. ""The building is colossal, I mean, it's 60 yards long and it's 12 yards deep - that's just the building on the river front and it's on two floors,"" he said. ""We've also got a similar-sized building on a single storey only running towards the back of the site. ""It's a huge amount of floor area and so that suggests a good mix of uses."" He said there were some ""wonderful"" and ""quite wacky"" ideas for its use that came out of community sessions and they were now examining the options. Among them might be an arts or archive centre. The idea of putting in a restaurant ""spilling out onto the river front"" is one that could have a key part to play. ""It would populate that space which could be a wonderful public space between the building and the water,"" he said. ""I think whatever happens that would be a necessary anchor."" Another option would be the potential for a cinema screen, studios and an exhibition or events space. ""There are lots of really good ideas and lots of interesting thoughts about it, which still need to be developed,"" said Mr Moloney. It all, of course, hinges on funding. ""I think we'd all like to think that in 10 years' time this building will be saved and in a mix of exciting uses,"" he said. ""But in terms of getting to the point where we have the money together and we know exactly what that mix will be I think we're looking optimistically at about a three-year process."" That would see a full-time development officer and support staff appointed to devote themselves to pulling the scheme together and attracting more support. In the shorter term, they have two projects taking place. On Friday evening, a Midwinter Light event will see lights switched on to illuminate the front of the building. Then, on Saturday, the public is invited to an open day between 11:00 and 15:00 to meet the group and share ideas of how to ensure Rosefield Mills flourishes. ""The river frontage is incredibly beautiful and everyone says we can't lose this, it's such a beautiful building,"" said Mr Moloney. ""I think there's a lot of affection for the building among the people of Dumfries, but also people who visit the town. ""We haven't given up yet, we're committed to finding a solution.""","['Architecture', 'Dumfries']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F61/production/_132275858_rosefieldmills.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17671/production/_132275859_richardpolley.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1AC9/production/_132275860_frontage.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/41D9/production/_132275861_lukemoloney.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/68E9/production/_132275862_riverside.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B709/production/_132275864_img_20180624_102408425.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6317/production/_132276352_rosefieldmllsbuilding.jpg']",['Giancarlo Rinaldi'],UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67951158,Why parents are reliving their baby loss nightmares,"A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) got underway this week into the deaths of three babies, all less than a day old, in Lanarkshire.",2024-01-11,"A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) got underway this week into the deaths of three babies, all less than a day old, in Lanarkshire. The death of a baby is an event no parent should endure, let alone in circumstances where - if there were different decisions, procedures, or knowledge - that baby may have survived. To then have the details of that personal tragedy made public is further trauma that no family would want. Mirabelle Bosch died at just 12 hours old on 2 July 2021 at Wishaw General Hospital. Ellie McCormick died at five hours old on 5 March 2019 at the same hospital. And Leo Lamont was two hours old when he died at Monklands Hospital on 15 February 2019. It is important that these deaths are not brushed off as isolated tragedies, and if there are common failings then they should be investigated to prevent anything like this from happening again. That is why three families who were anticipating a joyous turn in their lives are putting themselves through the distress of reliving their worst nightmare. This FAI was called by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service which has deemed it in the public interest for this inquiry to take place. Mirabelle, Leo and Ellie were all said to have died ""in circumstances giving rise to serious public concern"". The purpose of this FAI is not to apportion blame, but to establish what happened and prevent future deaths from happening in similar circumstances. A sheriff will hear evidence, and eventually issue a determination of their findings which can include recommendations. Sheriff Principle Aisha Anwar, who is leading this inquiry, is sensitive to the immense trauma suffered by each family. While there is no way to avoid the distressing detail of what happened, much of their evidence has been submitted as written affidavits to save them the ordeal of being questioned on it in court. All the parents were in court on the first day of the inquiry, but none have been there since. Although very little is known at this stage, it is clear that a key question families want answered is how and whether potential procedural or system errors contributed to their babies deaths. The inquiry is set out in three chapters, firstly looking at the circumstances around Mirabelle Bosch's death. Her father Eckhardt, told the inquiry they were ""led into a dark tunnel"" by ""misguided"" instructions which gave them a ""wrong sense of security"". They had believed everything with the pregnancy was normal, with antenatal checks suggesting the baby was healthy and developing as it should. But the court heard that despite a 31-week scan recording the baby as completely breech, three subsequent midwife examinations recorded it as being in a head down, cephalic position. This is the position that typically allows for the smoothest delivery. Even when Rozelle Bosch's waters broke suddenly on 30 June 2021 and she was examined in hospital, the midwife sent her home to wait for labour to advance. Mirabelle was considered a ""low-risk"" pregnancy and midwife Michelle Tannahill told the inquiry this week she saw ""no red flags"" upon her examination. ""Everything I had found that night was within the scope of my practice within midwifery. There wasn't anything concerning,"" she said. The details of what happened next are extremely distressing. Husband Eckhardt Bosch said he still feels the trauma in his body over the night of 1 July. After going into active labour at home, paramedics were called but a catalogue of delays ensued. It took five attempts to call the maternity unit at Wishaw General Hospital before anybody answered the phone, and paramedics were unable to deliver the baby themselves. Mirabelle's head was stuck and by the time mother and baby were taken to hospital, her chances of survival were very slim. She died hours later in her mother's arms. The post-mortem later noted that if the breech position had been recognised earlier in the pregnancy, then Rozelle would have likely been classified as a higher risk where a management plan for a hospital birth would have been arranged and the outcome may have been different. The pathologist also concluded if there had not been such a long delays transporting the patient to hospital, she may also have stood a chance of survival. Evidence has been heard from health professionals involved in Mirabelle's death, with expert witnesses who were not directly involved in the case to follow. The FAI will then examine the deaths of Ellie McCormick and Leo Lamont. At this point there is no indication that health professionals in Mirabelle's case had not followed the protocols or procedures in place at the time. However, there have been questions about whether software used to record details of the pregnancy may not have alerted those involved of potential risks, or may have some limitations in the information it can hold. Issues around the subjectivity of deciding whether a baby is engaged in early pregnancy, and how clear instructions are to mothers on when they come into hospital, have also been discussed. These areas are likely to be explored further when the inquiry examines the circumstances around the deaths of Leo and Ellie. Speaking to BBC Scotland News, the McCormick family lawyer said they believe Ellie's death was entirely avoidable. Darren Deery, a specialist in medical negligence law, said: ""The family's understanding is that there were potential defects in the system, in that certain risk factors weren't highlighted in the way they could, and should, have been. ""And had the subsequent midwifery and obstetrics staff been aware of those risks, a different course of action would have been taken and the outcome may well have been different."" Ultimately there will be no blame placed here, but it will look in detail at what happened in each case, considering whether systems were at fault, whether individual or collective errors were involved and it will establish what steps, if any, might be taken to prevent other children dying in similar circumstances.","['NHS Lanarkshire', 'Wishaw', 'Pregnancy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E630/production/_132282985_gettyimages-1049935244.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9399/production/_132258773_spin-babiesfaiglasgowsheriff-002.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D49C/production/_132282445_faibabyrantwithdepartures.1_frame_1057.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1BC2/production/_132260170_faibabydeathlawyer_frame_3989.jpg']",['Lisa Summers'],UK,Scotland

Angharad told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme about why she chose a tower block for the project.She said: “I was looking where there would be lots of people honestly, the community here is really diverse.“There’s lots of walls, so I was thinking lots of people might want some art for their walls.” Angharad, who is originally from Tipperley, says the exhibition is about more than just selling art.“Its about celebrating communities and celebrating people,"" she continued.""We all had such a rubbish time during lockdown that the idea was just to have a bit of fun, and to create things where people are coming in - we’re almost having a different party every few months."" There’s a fishy theme to the current exhibition, created by Angharad herself, which is based on a community fishmongers.“The plan is every time you come here it’ll be a different type of retail unit, or at least that's what it’ll look like,” Angharad added.She continued: “It's inspired by my local village fishmonger, which is a glorious community hub. It’s supposed to be where you go to get your scallops and whatnot but actually it's where you go to find out who’s doing what.”Future displays will also take inspiration from other retail units such as a restaurant. And the community seem to be behind the project.The artist says seeing the local children getting involved was unexpected but has been one of the highlights.She said: ""The local children have worked out that I’m a bit soft, they've figured out that I’ll swap drawings for a piece of art.""We think for the next show we'll have colouring books, we'll have more things to interact with the children and at the end we'll have a mini show, where we'll have their work on the wall.""There is lots planned for the space in the coming months, and it won't just be art displays.Glasgow based synth-pop punk band Brenda are next in line at the Sink, bringing music to the space.They are set to host a music video launch at the gallery on 3 February.",['Maryhill'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/586/cpsprodpb/4da6/live/c28a4890-b0ac-11ee-91f2-abf5208f9e37.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/157c/live/a2570090-b07f-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/af4b/live/c012d960-b07f-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/359c/live/e67ad360-b09c-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

Mark Wringe, of Sleat, said attending his local public consultation event had not provided him with insights into advantages of having the designation.He said: ""I really want to know what they are because my fears are there are an awful lot of disadvantages, in particular the philosophical problem that we are seen as a park and a recreational resource.""I think that most of urban Scotland doesn't see that we are community that lives and works here, as we always have done.""I think if we are seen as just a play place that is detrimental to life here and other places like Skye."" Roddy Murray, of Tarskavaig, said he was not opposed to national parks but believed funding should be prioritised to fix problems facing islanders.""If there was plenty of money for roads, transport, care, education and social work then a national park would be a good thing,"" he said.""But I think in the current situation it's simply the wrong priority."" Before Christmas, Radio Skye aired a special programme on the idea of park status for Skye, Raasay and Rona.Adam Gordon, a cultural journalist and broadcaster at the station, said listeners were asked if they were for, against or undecided on the proposal.He said the programme received more than 100 comments, and almost all of them were against the idea in principle. Mr Gordon said: ""We cannot say for sure whether people were well versed in what it (park status) means.""But certainly their instinctive feelings about this were largely against.""Mr Gordon said the main concern that emerged was about another layer of authority being added to what was already in place under Highland Council and Scottish and UK governments.Radio Skye listeners also questioned why a national park was needed to unlock funding for roads, housing and tourism infrastructure.Mr Gordon said this week would be pivotal because islanders would have the chance to get more information on the plans from the public events to help them make up their minds. Local Highland councillor Drew Miller submitted the expression of interest to the Scottish government.He previously told BBC Naidheachdan park status could help the islands better manage the demands for their thousands of visitors, including through the use of bylaws and a visitor levy.The islands, along with the nearby mainland area of Lochalsh, attract 750,000 visitors a year, according to business organisation Skye Connect. Mr Miller said: ""We have huge visitor numbers and iconic sites are being swamped and we need to control that""Over April, May and June the island had 2,000 campervans, with some parking in laybys and on private land.""He said a national park designation would also offer greater protection to the environment.Mr Miller encouraged people to express what they would see as the benefits - and any perceived negative impacts - of park status.He added if a bid was made it would be followed by ""intense consultation"". Another local councillor, John Finlayson, said on Thursday that islanders' views would be listened to and urged people to attend the community engagement events to get answers to their questions.He said: ""In my opinion, if the people of Skye say after they've become informed they don't want an application to go forward then that's what needs to happen.""Of course, if they say that it is a good thing then we have to support an application going forward.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67948509,Scotland to replicate ban on XL bully dogs - Yousaf,"First Minister Humza Yousaf has said the Scottish government will ""in essence replicate"" UK laws banning XL bully dogs without a licence.",2024-01-11,"First Minister Humza Yousaf has said the Scottish government will ""in essence replicate"" UK laws banning XL bully dogs without a licence. The Scottish government has faced calls to fall in line with restrictions on the breed south of the border. Amid rising concerns over attacks, the UK government banned the breed in England and Wales. The Scottish government has accepted there has been an influx of XL bullies to Scotland since the UK's new law. Mr Yousaf said the UK government's measures were ""not a ban"" and were announced without consultation with the Scottish government. As of 31 December, the UK government has banned the breeding, selling or abandonment of the dogs in England. Additional measures will make it a criminal offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate in England and Wales from the start of February. The certificate involves paying a £92.40 application fee and dogs must also be kept on a lead and muzzled in public. When the issue was raised at First Minister's Questions on Thursday, Mr Yousaf said the measures in England were not an outright ban on XL bullies as owners could still keep them under certain criteria. He said: ""What has become clear, I'm afraid in the last few weeks, is we have seen a flow of XL bully dogs coming to Scotland. ""As such, we will give further details to members of the Scottish Parliament through a parliamentary statement if the parliamentary bureau agrees next week. ""We will, in essence, replicate the legislation that is in England and Wales here in Scotland because ultimately, although we do have a very good system of dog control notice schemes, and we do take the approach indeed not to breed, we have to respond to the situation as it currently stands and therefore we will do what we need to do to ensure public safety."" Earlier this week, Scottish community safety minister Siobhian Brown told MSPs the matter was being reviewed ""urgently"" and said it would be ""preferable"" if people did not purchase XL bullies. However, the Scottish Conservatives said she should not ""dither and delay"" on the issue. Speaking to journalists after FMQs, Mr Yousaf said the UK government's measures were ""not a ban"" and were announced without consultation with the Scottish government. He stressed the importance of carrying out such consultations, saying: ""The consultation has taken place in relation to the engagement that Siobhian Brown has had with key stakeholders. ""We can't ignore the fact that over the last few weeks we have seen evidence of that flow of XL bully dogs [to Scotland]. ""We'll therefore look to replicate some of those safeguards."" Mike Flynn, chief superintendent of the Scottish SPCA, told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme: ""Obviously, we're a bit shocked, the sudden nature of the change of direction. ""My understanding is that [the Scottish government] is having to act because of all the media reports of dogs being brought up to Scotland and us being a kind of dumping ground. ""If it is going to go ahead, we would hope to work with the Scottish government to make sure there's a better system in place for people registering their dogs than there has been down in England and Wales, which has been a total farce to be honest with you."" Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene called the announcement a ""humiliating U-turn for Humza Yousaf and the SNP government"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67945677,How easy will it be to clear Scottish postmasters?,Rishi Sunak and Humza Yousaf have found something they agree on - that post office branch managers wrongly convicted in the Horizon scandal should be cleared.,2024-01-11,"Rishi Sunak and Humza Yousaf have found something they agree on - that post office branch managers wrongly convicted in the Horizon scandal should be cleared. What they do not yet agree on is how that should be achieved in Scotland. When it became clear that the UK government was considering legislation to overturn convictions in England and Wales, the Scottish government said it was looking at doing something similar. Then when Rishi Sunak actually announced his plans, the Scottish position shifted with Humza Yousaf calling for a UK-wide solution - not necessarily the default position of an independence supporting politician. The first minister has suggested that the ""easiest and fastest"" solution could be for Westminster legislation to be extended to cover Scottish cases with Holyrood's approval. He has offered to work with UK ministers to find a way forward and his justice secretary, Angela Constance has written to her UK counterpart, Alex Chalk seeking urgent talks. The Scottish government is still keeping open the option of drafting its own legislation but is concerned that doing so could inadvertently prevent Scottish post office managers accessing the UK compensation scheme. At the moment, the compensation scheme is only open to those who are cleared in the appeal courts or were members of a group of sub-postmasters who settled with the Post Office in 2019. So, if Holyrood overturned Scottish convictions it would probably still need Westminster to change the rules of the scheme to ensure those cleared in this way could still claim compensation. Maybe a one-size-fits-all approach across the UK would be simpler. Except that the prime minister's official spokesman has already suggested that may be tricky. ""We want to work with relevant bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland on this matter. It is not something we can do cross-UK,"" he said. Another UK government source told me they were ""looking into it"" but that it's ""not straightforward"" to overturn convictions in Scotland. This source suggested a blanket pardon may be easier to do but would fall short of the full exoneration that the UK government believes is required. Holyrood has previously passed legislation pardoning miners for activities during the strikes in the 1980s and pardoning gay and bisexual men who have historic convictions for sexual activities with other men. It was suggested to me by a Scottish government source that these laws might offer a starting point for clearing post office branch managers. Again, the problem would be that a pardon is not the same as quashing a conviction, making clear that it was wrong in the first place. I don't pretend to fully understand the legal complexities these unusual circumstances present. Scotland and England are different legal jurisdictions and in Scotland, the Crown Office and procurator fiscal service acted as the prosecutor. In England and Wales, the post office took many of the cases to court itself. That difference may well be one of the key issues that government lawyers need to work through. However, if both the Scottish and UK governments are determined to find a way forward then the expectation must be that that is what will happen. The Horizon scandal leaves huge questions for the Post Office, ministers of all political varieties and a range of prosecuting authorities - questions being explored by a UK public inquiry. At Holyrood question time, the focus turned on the role of the Crown Office and procurator fiscal service (COPFS) and whether it responded appropriately in 2013 when it was made aware of concerns about the Horizon evidence. Both the Conservatives and Labour are now demanding that the Lord Advocate, Dorothy Bain - who heads up the Crown Office - makes a statement to parliament. Her office has confirmed she is willing to do so. The Lord Advocate is a minister in the Scottish government and its chief legal adviser as well as Scotland's chief prosecutor - which is a separate and independent function. This dual role often causes confusion and from time to time raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest. The current Lord Advocate has only been in post since 2021. Frank Mulholland held the position 2011-2016 - the period during which prosecutions that relied on Horizon evidence were eventually stopped. Deputy Crown Agent, Kenny Donnelly said: ""As an independent and impartial prosecution service, COPFS is determined to ensure that all miscarriages of justice resulting from unreliable evidence obtained from the Horizon system are identified and overturned so that those affected can access the compensation and redress that they are entitled to"". His boss, the Lord Advocate, is expected to face detailed questioning by MSPs at some point next week.","['Scottish government', 'Scottish Parliament', 'Humza Yousaf', 'Post Office Ltd']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2113/production/_132276480_22c663397ad1c73cf01c2c0c6e2870a1acc7fdfb.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9643/production/_132276483_8e9040385bff1390e6aa9e1557102c78296391ec.jpg']",['Glenn Campbell'],UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67934837,"Children are more vulnerable to poor air quality, says Dundee study","Increased air pollution leads to more children being admitted to hospital with lung conditions - but does not have the same impact on adults, a study has suggested.",2024-01-11,"Increased air pollution leads to more children being admitted to hospital with lung conditions - but does not have the same impact on adults, a study has suggested. Researchers at the University of Dundee's medical school examined 35,000 cases over 14 years in Tayside. Their report concluded that young people may be vulnerable to much lower levels of pollution than adults. They said this strengthened the case for controversial low emission zones. The study mapped hospital admissions against increased levels of air pollution. It found that ""many more"" people under 16 were admitted with asthma and chest infections in the days after air quality had dropped. Only around half of them would have needed hospital care if pollution had been within legal limits, the study said. It added that hospital admissions among children were ""significantly associated"" with exposure to higher levels of air pollution over a two-week period - but that this was not the case for adults. The study concluded that more should be done to ""improve and enforce"" the air pollution limits in cities ""for the sake of our children's health"". Prof Jill Belch, who led the research, said the growing nature of young lungs meant they were more easily damaged by toxins. She told BBC Scotland News: ""Adults do not seem to be so badly affected but our children are really affected and that's why it's a really important thing to decrease pollution. ""Children are outside running around, breathing in the pollution, but most importantly children's cells are dividing, and dividing cells are the ones that are really, really vulnerable to air pollution."" Prof Belch said Scotland had the best air pollution laws in Europe - but that there was a problem with implementation. ""That's why we need to support these low emission zone projects, because it's only through doing that that our children will be safe,"" she added. Scotland's first zone became operational in Glasgow last year, with schemes due to follow in Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh. Cars, lorries and other forms of transportation which do not meet emission guidelines are not allowed into the city centre and drivers who break the regulations can be fined. The World Health Organisation has estimated that air pollution contributes to around 6.7 million premature deaths each year. In 2020, Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death. She died in 2013, aged nine, after being exposed to ""excessive"" levels of pollution from a major road close to her home at Lewisham in south-east London, according to a coroner. Her mother Rosamund, who campaigns against air pollution, has welcomed the findings of the Dundee study. She said: ""We knew every time there was a spike in air pollution, Ella was admitted to our local hospital in Lewisham so it's just backing up what we already know. ""This means that not just governments but policy makers need to take this very seriously."" The study was carried out as part of the Tayside Pollution Research Programme and its findings published in the journal Aerosol and Air Quality Research. Dr Munro Stewart, a GP in Dundee, believes six hospital admissions of children from his own practice could have been avoided in the past six months if air quality had been better. He said: ""It is avoidable so the good thing is we know if we get clean air it will save lives, it will reduce pressure on the NHS and can boost the economy as well. ""It increases health inequality because those who least likely to drive a car are most likely to be affected by air pollution.""","['Air pollution', 'Dundee']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12A8/production/_132267740_profjillbelch.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AEE8/production/_132267744_dundeelochee.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11BB3/production/_132272627_emissions.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EB24/production/_132269106_ella.jpg']",['Kevin Keane'],UK,Scotland

It’s supposed to be where you go to get your scallops and whatnot but actually it's where you go to find out who’s doing what.”Future displays will also take inspiration from other retail units such as a restaurant.

Stuart McInnes subjected two vulnerable victims to repeated sexual assaults when they were incapable of giving consent. He also raped a third woman on a single occasion when she was asleep and under the influence of valium. The judge ordered that McInnes, formerly of Clydebank, be supervised for a further five years after his release. McInnes, 57, was convicted of five offences carried out between January 2006 and June 2020 at five addresses in the West Dunbartonshire town.The High Court in Edinburgh heard that his victims were incapable of giving consent because they were asleep and/or under the influence of drink or drugs.  Judge Lord Armstrong told McInnes: ""The crimes of which you have been convicted are disturbing and grave.""A victim impact statement from one of the women revealed the devastating and long-term consequences for her following the abuse, the judge said.The crimes were so serious and carried out over such a long period of time that there was no appropriate alternative to a custodial sentence, he added. Lord Armstrong ordered that McInnes, who has never previously served a jail term, should be kept under supervision and monitored for a further five years when he is released into the community in order to protect the public. During that time he will be on licence and if he breaches its conditions he can be returned to prison.McInnes repeatedly raped the first woman and often attacked her when she was asleep or intoxicated with alcohol and/or prescribed medication.A second woman was subjected to repeated rapes while she was sleeping or unconscious and under the influence of drugs.The third woman was intoxicated with valium and asleep or unconscious when she had her underwear removed and was raped at a flat in Clydebank. A background report prepared on McInnes assessed him as posing a medium risk of sexual reoffending.Defence counsel Edward Targowski KC said: ""He has told the social worker he has no recollection of the offences and clearly that is as a result of consuming drugs and alcohol on a regular basis.""He added that McInnes had shown remorse and said he was sorry for his actions.McInnes was placed on the sex offenders' register for an indefinite period.",['Clydebank'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/409c/live/1a633390-b082-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg'],['N/A'],UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe61rzxgxlo,Do islanders on Skye want a park life?,Skye and the neighbouring islands of Raasay and Rona could be nominated as a new national park - if islanders back the idea.,2024-01-11,"Skye and the neighbouring islands of Raasay and Rona could be nominated as a new national park - if islanders back the idea.An expression of interest has already been submitted to the Scottish government and a series of public consultations are taking place this week.Scotland currently has two national parks - the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs.Could the islands - home to a total of about 10,800 people as well as dramatic mountain and coastal landscapes - be joining them? Mark Wringe, of Sleat, said attending his local public consultation event had not provided him with insights into advantages of having the designation.He said: ""I really want to know what they are because my fears are there are an awful lot of disadvantages, in particular the philosophical problem that we are seen as a park and a recreational resource.""I think that most of urban Scotland doesn't see that we are community that lives and works here, as we always have done.""I think if we are seen as just a play place that is detrimental to life here and other places like Skye."" Roddy Murray, of Tarskavaig, said he was not opposed to national parks but believed funding should be prioritised to fix problems facing islanders.""If there was plenty of money for roads, transport, care, education and social work then a national park would be a good thing,"" he said.""But I think in the current situation it's simply the wrong priority."" Before Christmas, Radio Skye aired a special programme on the idea of park status for Skye, Raasay and Rona.Adam Gordon, a cultural journalist and broadcaster at the station, said listeners were asked if they were for, against or undecided on the proposal.He said the programme received more than 100 comments, and almost all of them were against the idea in principle. Mr Gordon said: ""We cannot say for sure whether people were well versed in what it (park status) means.""But certainly their instinctive feelings about this were largely against.""Mr Gordon said the main concern that emerged was about another layer of authority being added to what was already in place under Highland Council and Scottish and UK governments.Radio Skye listeners also questioned why a national park was needed to unlock funding for roads, housing and tourism infrastructure.Mr Gordon said this week would be pivotal because islanders would have the chance to get more information on the plans from the public events to help them make up their minds. Local Highland councillor Drew Miller submitted the expression of interest to the Scottish government.He previously told BBC Naidheachdan park status could help the islands better manage the demands for their thousands of visitors, including through the use of bylaws and a visitor levy.The islands, along with the nearby mainland area of Lochalsh, attract 750,000 visitors a year, according to business organisation Skye Connect. Mr Miller said: ""We have huge visitor numbers and iconic sites are being swamped and we need to control that""Over April, May and June the island had 2,000 campervans, with some parking in laybys and on private land.""He said a national park designation would also offer greater protection to the environment.Mr Miller encouraged people to express what they would see as the benefits - and any perceived negative impacts - of park status.He added if a bid was made it would be followed by ""intense consultation"". Another local councillor, John Finlayson, said on Thursday that islanders' views would be listened to and urged people to attend the community engagement events to get answers to their questions.He said: ""In my opinion, if the people of Skye say after they've become informed they don't want an application to go forward then that's what needs to happen.""Of course, if they say that it is a good thing then we have to support an application going forward."" The National Parks (Scotland) Act, external was passed 23 years ago and led to the creation of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park in 2002 and the Cairngorms in 2003.The Cairngorms was extended in 2010 and is the largest park in the UK covering parts of the Highlands, Moray, Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and Angus.According to the Scottish government, national parks are models of sustainable development.The aims of parks are to:Work to protect and enhance natural and cultural heritagePromote responsible access to natureSupport local communitiesManage millions of visitors annuallyPark authorities are required to produce plans on the management of their areas.The authorities' planning committees make decisions on local developments.Expressions of interest have been received for other parts of Scotland, including the Lammermuirs and Glen Affric.The deadline for nominations for new parks in 29 February.",['Isle of Skye'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/960/cpsprodpb/ab3f/live/f73184a0-afd0-11ee-b482-cf372d3f0fdc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/952/cpsprodpb/ce5e/live/3280ecb0-b0a0-11ee-b98c-a15f44e54519.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/958/cpsprodpb/c314/live/761b2350-b0a0-11ee-b98c-a15f44e54519.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/210f/live/15f8f280-affc-11ee-9036-0f5c43a8a9fe.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/894/cpsprodpb/d4f4/live/0c5b4dc0-afd1-11ee-b482-cf372d3f0fdc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/908/cpsprodpb/945a/live/9a56b990-afcf-11ee-b482-cf372d3f0fdc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/936/cpsprodpb/620b/live/271b72c0-afd1-11ee-b482-cf372d3f0fdc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/947/cpsprodpb/bb44/live/3b569620-afd1-11ee-b482-cf372d3f0fdc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/886/cpsprodpb/e9b5/live/1b40d140-b0a1-11ee-b905-a5f1fa14fedf.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67938329,Rennie Mackintosh tea rooms saved for the nation,"A famous Glasgow tea rooms, originally designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, is to be taken over by the National Trust for Scotland.",2024-01-11,"A famous Glasgow tea rooms, originally designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, is to be taken over by the National Trust for Scotland. The Mackintosh at the Willow on Sauchiehall Street was reopened five years ago after a £10m restoration. Its future operations had been threatened by ""difficult trading conditions"". But The Willow Tea Rooms Trust said it had now found a ""safe haven"" with the National Trust for Scotland. The conservation charity will add the tea rooms to its portfolio of properties which include Mackintosh's Hill House in Helensburgh. It said it was using £1.75m of its reserves and acquisition funds to address the immediate financial challenges and keep the business trading. The NTS said the business model was ""fundamentally sound and successful"" and it was hopeful it would eventually get a return on its investment. Last year the tea rooms attracted more than 230,000 visitors. But the effects of the Covid pandemic and the fire which destroyed Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art have affected its income in recent years. The original 1903 Willow Tea Rooms were designed in their entirety by Mackintosh and he had total control inside and out. It is the last remaining original of the several tea rooms designed by the celebrated architect, working with his wife Margaret Macdonald, for entrepreneur Miss Kate Cranston. He remodelled the exterior of the 1860s tenement block and oversaw the interior decorative elements, right down to the design of the cutlery and the uniform of the waitresses. In later years, as fashions changed, Mackintosh's Sauchiehall Street tea rooms underwent various transformations, including being hidden behind the bridal wear of a department store. There were various attempts to revive the rooms and restore them to their former glory but by 2014 the building was up for sale and its future looked bleak. But Glasgow businesswoman Celia Sinclair Thornqvist made it her mission to bring the tea rooms back to life. She bought the building and set up a charitable trust to own and restore it before embarking on an effort to raise £10m, including £3.5m from heritage lottery funds. The idea of the restoration was that every element had to be exactly as Mackintosh had intended. Covid, the cost of living and two fires in the neighbourhood - including Mackintosh's School of Art - took their toll on what had once been a thriving business. A new partner was needed and the National Trust for Scotland offered security, profile and a membership known for their passion for heritage. And of course Celia Sinclair Thornqvist sealed the deal over a cup of tea in the elegant salon de luxe. The NTS now face the same challenges as the Willow Tea Rooms Trust. They too are still recovering from the pandemic, dealing with rising costs and decreased footfall. But they also have a bigger budget, more support and experience in tourism and marketing. They are confident the £1.7m they have invested in Mackintosh at the Willows will not just be returned but will contribute to the maintenance of the other 130 properties in their portfolio. And exactly ten years after she first began work on the restoration of Mackintosh at the Willow, Celia is happy to let someone else take on the task of keeping the legend alive. ""I think they'll find it hard to get rid of me,"" she says ""I'll be having my tea and scone but I'm happy to leave the responsibility to someone else."" Phil Long, the National Trust for Scotland's chief executive, said: ""We've made the financial investment we have because we believe in the outstanding heritage significance of Mackintosh. He's known around the world. ""The business model for this place is fundamentally sound and successful but the external difficulties that it faced made the last years very challenging. ""We're in the fortunate position to deal with these financial challenges and set off on a new footing."" Ms Sinclair Thornqvist said the Willow Tea Room trustees had turned to the NTS as a ""safe haven"" to protect the integrity of the building, its decoration, the services provided and its dedicated staff. Mackintosh at the Willow will formally become one of the National Trust for Scotland's properties with effect from 19 January. Mackintosh is to Glasgow as Gaudi is to Barcelona and Frank Lloyd Wright to Chicago. He is the designer who best sums up its style and its outlook. Kate Cranston's Willow Tea Rooms was where Mackintosh showed his flair to the public. He was born in Glasgow's Townhead in 1868, the fourth son of a policeman, and became an apprentice architect at 15. He later worked for Glasgow firm Honeyman and Keppie while also studying at Glasgow School of Art. Mackintosh was chosen to build the new art school in 1896 and, despite being unloved at the time, it was later considered his masterpiece until it was destroyed in a fire in 2018. Other Mackintosh buildings include Scotland Street School, the Queen's Cross Church and Hill House in Helensburgh, which is also owned by the National Trust for Scotland. He was largely unappreciated in Britain during his lifetime but in Europe he was admired as a leading figure in avant-garde art and design. However, one wealthy patron returned to Mackintosh time and again - Miss Catherine Cranston, the empress of Glasgow's tea rooms. In 1896, she asked him to design a set of murals for her Buchanan Street premises. Two years later, for her Argyle Street tea rooms, Mackintosh produced a piece of furniture that would evolve into a design icon - his high-backed chair. In 1903, Miss Cranston asked him to design her fourth Glasgow tea room, the famous Willow Tea Rooms, once the city's ultimate house of splendour.","['Glasgow', 'Architecture']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10229/production/_102798066_upstairs.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0117/production/_102797200_swns_mackintosh_free_009.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11057/production/_102791796_mediaitem102791795.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B35F/production/_102791954_mediaitem102791953.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/18002/production/_113060389_paulinemclean_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13EC7/production/_132270618_53453317813_bcf0622c57_o.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/C50B/production/_101534405_presentational_grey_line464-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/98FA/production/_101826193_crm.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/C50B/production/_101534405_presentational_grey_line464-nc.png']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

Asked what he knew about Christopher's ability to swim, he said: ""I knew he couldn't swim, he used to joke around a lot but I knew he couldn't swim."" The court has heard from a number of teenagers who were at the scene, with some saying they were unsure whether Christopher could swim, and others saying they saw Christopher get pushed into the water.

He said he remembered seeing Christopher in the water: ""He started panicking, slapping the water, going wild, you could see he was panicking.""

Barristers representing the alleged pusher have told the court that the teenager stumbled and fell into Christopher.

""But loads or people jumped in for him but Christopher was dragging everyone down.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67941824,Powys: Street lights off in Wales' first dark sky community,A town and nearby village has been announced as Wales' first dark sky community.,2024-01-11,"A town and nearby village has been announced as Wales' first dark sky community. It means the street lighting in Presteigne and Norton in Powys will turn off earlier or dim to reduce light pollution. Supporters say it will allow residents to get an exceptional and clear view of the stars in the night sky. Residents in the area have been working towards this goal for the past six years. The area has now been designated an international dark sky community by the organisation DarkSky International. ""The community has worked tenaciously over the last six years to highlight the benefits of becoming a dark sky community"", said the area's dark skies community leader, Leigh-Harling Bowen. Residents saw the potential early on and turned off light in their homes and businesses. Jay Tate, who works at The Spaceguard Centre observatory in nearby Knighton said the change meant he was able to do ""much more"" in his work. ""There was a certain amount of resistance at the beginning because it's new… there was a bit of concern about whether it was safe,"" he said. ""People thought we'd just switch the lights off, but once the situation's explained… everybody's more than happy,"" he added. He said the change made his job, which includes scanning the night sky for asteroids and comets, ""much easier"". About half of the street lights in the area have been programmed to switch off and the rest have been pre-set to half their intensity after midnight. The dark sky community covers an area of 40 sq km (15 sq m) and a combined population of 2,700 live there. Beverley Baynham, mayor of Presteigne and Norton, said: ""For the layperson, for anyone walking in the community, you probably don't actually notice the difference. ""It's just lit in a more intelligent way… so there's no concerns, no worries about safety. It's better for the light pollution, it's better for the environment, but it's also better for our community."" She called being the first in Wales ""a wonderful achievement for such a small community"". There is also another bonus, wildlife - birds, bats and insects have returned to the communities at night. Similar schemes may now be rolled out across Powys, and some would like to see Wales become the first dark skies nation. Amber Harrison, dark sky programme manager, said: ""Being dark sky-friendly doesn't mean turning out the lights. ""The approach taken to retrofit lighting using adaptive technology is unique among dark sky places,"" she said. ""I am excited to see how this will influence others in the future.""","['Astronomy', 'Wales', 'Environment', 'Light pollution', 'Presteigne']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16F1C/production/_125308939_corcymrupaul_1859.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B66E/production/_125320764_darkskiesstill3.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/175D6/production/_125320759_p0ccf8hz.jpg']",['George Zielinski'],UK,Wales

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-67949319,S4C: Senedd committee joins calls for chair to go,Senedd politicians have joined a cross-party group of MPs in calling for the chair of scandal-hit broadcaster S4C to be replaced.,2024-01-11,"Senedd politicians have joined a cross-party group of MPs in calling for the chair of scandal-hit broadcaster S4C to be replaced. The organisation has been in crisis after a string of bullying allegations saw two senior officers fired. Members of the Welsh Parliament's culture committee said high numbers of staff leaving the channel ""should have rung alarm bells"", accusing him of a failure of oversight and governance. S4C said it had nothing to add. At a hearing of the committee on Thursday Mr Williams defended why he did not act sooner prior to concerns being raised by the Bectu union, saying it was because staff would not approach him in fear of the chief executive. It was the second of two grillings the chair faced from politicians in two days - with the first from the Welsh Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. Both committees concluded that Mr Williams should be replaced once his term ends on 1 April. It is up to the UK government's Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to reinstate him, or appoint a new chair. The Senedd committee's conclusions came after Mr Williams criticised the MPs for allegedly showing ""no concern"" for staff at S4C. Making the case to stay on, Mr Williams said staff and producers wanted stability. Mr Williams faced scrutiny over how he has handled difficulties at the broadcaster, which became dogged by allegations of inappropriate behaviour last year. A report by lawyers at Capital Law heard claims that the channel's chief executive, Sian Doyle, had behaved like a dictator - the law firm had spoken to 92 people who gave evidence about the atmosphere and working environment at S4C. Ms Doyle has rejected the allegations. She and another senior officer the report named said they had been given no notice of the report and had not been offered a right of reply by S4C. At the Senedd Mr Williams defended not sharing the report prior to publication, suggesting the report could have been ""misused"" in a campaign aired in the press against him had it been shared with individuals it named. Mr Williams said it had been the ""most difficult period in the history of S4C"". Amid claims by Labour of ""total silence"" from the culture secretary, Mr Williams said he was told by government officials that a meeting with Ms Frazer ""was not necessary"". In a letter to her Senedd culture committee chair Delyth Jewell said it was ""wholly unacceptable that that neither you, as secretary of state, nor indeed your predecessors, have seen fit to meet the leadership of S4C"". She said it was astonishing that requests for a meeting were not accepted. ""In an organisation the size of S4C, it should have been apparent to the chair that there were significant problems. The high numbers of staff leaving the channel should have rung alarm bells. ""The fact that this did not happen suggests a failure of oversight and governance on the Chair's behalf. ""In that regard, we recommend that a new chair should be appointed to lead the Board of S4C as it seeks to repair and renew its reputation."" She called for the Welsh government in Cardiff to be given a formal role in the appointment of the next chair. At the hearing on Thursday Labour MS Alun Davies read Mr Williams an extract from the Capital Law report, in which a staff member describes becoming ""very tearful"" and unable to sleep. Mr Davies said he found it ""quite incredible"" that as someone with ""decades of experience in this area"" and ""an experienced chairperson"" you ""didn't know until you received the letter from the union what was happening within the organisation where you were chair"". Mr Williams confirmed that ""none of the staff had approached me until that time"". ""The reason it hadn't happened was that nobody had felt that they could approach me, or another member of the board, because of fear of the chief executive, the behaviour of the chief executive and the conduct of the chief executive,"" he said. Mr Williams explained why he did not let the two senior staff criticised in the Capital Law report see the document before it was published. As well as Sian Doyle, the report also criticised the behaviour of sacked chief content officer Llinos Griffin-Williams, who had accused S4C of a lack of due process. She was sacked over an alleged incident in Nantes where she was claimed to have told a Welsh rugby star she could end his career - she has denied that and has threatened legal action. In the Welsh Parliament committee Mr Williams accused the pair of mounting a media ""campaign"" against ""myself against, the board and against S4C, against DCMS [UK government Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport], against the secretary of state"". ""Would it have been responsible for us to provide that report beforehand to people who would have an opportunity to misuse it?"" The individuals had already ""plenty of efforts"" to undermine the report prior to publication, he said, and giving them advance sight of the document would have enabled further attempts to do so. he said. ""That has happened since then. It's being denied that any of this happened despite the weight of evidence that we have received."" Asked if he had considered his position, Mr Williams said there had been ""no focus whatsoever yesterday on what staff members in S4C have suffered"" at the Commons committee on Wednesday. ""There was no concern expressed about what they have had to go through over a long period of months."" Arguing why he should stay, Mr Williams said staff and production companies want a ""period of stability"". ""Anything that creates further instability for our staff is not going to help the staff, and is not going to help the organisation as a whole either,"" he said. A DCMS spokesperson said: ""Since S4C was launched in 1982 by the UK government, the broadcaster has made a valuable contribution to the lives and wellbeing of Welsh speakers and learners. The government is expanding S4C's powers in the media bill which is currently going through parliament and has increased its funding since 2022 to support its digital development. ""As its sponsor department, DCMS has had frequent contact with S4C at senior official level as well as through correspondence and meetings between ministers and S4C leadership.""","['Wales', 'S4C']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C7A/production/_114922967_20201014_rhodri_williams_9758.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A0ED/production/_132279114_mediaitem129577093.jpg']","['David Deans', 'Adrian Browne']",UK,Wales

The Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce has compared 33 similarly wealthy nations in a survival league table. Wales ranks 32nd for stomach cancer, 31st for pancreatic and lung, 21st for liver and oesophageal and 12th for brain. The Welsh government said it was committed to improving cancer outcomes. The taskforce - a partnership of cancer charities including Tenovus Cancer Care - suggests Wales and the rest of the UK rank below most other countries for five-year survival rates. South Korea, Belgium, the United States, Australia and China were the countries that scored the highest. The six deadliest cancers are lung, liver, brain, oesophageal, pancreatic and stomach. More than 90,000 people are diagnosed with one of these six in the UK every year, and they account for 67,000 deaths - about half all cancer deaths. The chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, Judi Rhys, said people with these cancers had a ""shockingly low life expectancy"". Ms Rhys, who is also chairwoman of the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce Wales subgroup, said: ""The actions we've repeatedly called for - targeted screening and monitoring those most at risk - would have a huge impact on survival. ""These latest statistics should be a strong reminder to Welsh government of the importance of prioritising and accelerating cancer survival initiatives."" She said ""exciting developments going on"" included a breath test that helps detect pancreatic cancer, which she wants more research done on. ""Similarly some of the tests that can be used for things like Barrett's oesophagus - which is the precursor often to throat cancer - we have some very simple, well tolerated tools that can be used which would be able to detect those cancers earlier. ""We're not rolling those out across Wales at the moment and that is a real concern to us."" About 15,400 people survive five years in the UK but, if rates were the same as the best performing countries, that could be as many as 23,775 people. The taskforce's report suggests delayed diagnosis and slow access to treatment could be to blame. Many patients were only diagnosed after an emergency admission to hospital or an urgent referral after their symptoms become severe. The Wales Cancer Network published a three-year cancer improvement plan last year, including plans for rapid diagnostic centres. The most recent NHS performance figures showed 56% of patients were treated within the target 62-days of cancer being suspected. The Welsh government said cancer is one of the six planning priorities for the NHS and it is committed to improving cancer outcomes. It said: ""The NHS Executive has introduced a national intervention that specifically targets improvement in service provision for gynaecological, urological, and lower gastrointestinal cancers - the cancers with the most challenging cancer performance.""","['Cancer', 'Health', 'Welsh government', 'Wales', 'NHS Wales']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D8D3/production/_132270555_2e32df131590af55a7c84074e89e1b55c271355f.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8AB3/production/_132270553_judirhystenovuscancercarenew.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/17F0D/production/_127816089_sounds_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/2365/production/_127816090_sounds_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']",['Jenny Rees'],UK,Wales

Councillors approved enforcement plans to try protect the Westgate Hotel, which was at the centre of the 1839 Newport Rising. The last large-scale armed rising in Wales saw soldiers clash with Chartists marching for voting rights. Volunteers and conservationists began work to preserve the building in 2019 but were ejected from it last Autumn. According to the Local Democracy Reporting service, Newport council said trespassers and vandals have been damaging the disused, privately-owned property, including setting fires. Council officers visited the Westgate with the building's owner last week, a planning committee meeting was told. They found evidence of damage to important features and graffiti covering walls. Senior planning enforcement officer Neil Gunther described structural disrepair due to gutters being ""solid with vegetation"", causing ""water ingress"". A ""substantial collapse"" of the ceiling was also found in one part of the hotel. If plants like buddleia were ""allowed to grow"" in the stonework it would lead to more damage, Mr Gunther warned. He said the owner had been asked to carry out urgent repairs to make the building safe and watertight. The planning committee agreed unanimously that if those works are not carried out, the council should be granted enforcement powers to do the repairs itself, and then recover the costs from the owner. Committee member John Reynolds called the Westgate a ""UK site of significance for our democracy"" and said there was ""a need to protect it"". His colleague Stephen Cocks said it was a ""tragedy"" to see the ""deterioration"" of the historic hotel. Committee chairman Mark Spencer said it was ""important that we look after this building as best we can"". The future of the ""water-damaged and deteriorating"" Westgate remains unclear. Mr Gunther told councillors any enforcement action was ""not a way of getting the building back into use"". Asked by committee member Ray Mogford whether the owner had signalled any plans for the future of the building, Mr Gunther said the owner ""had what looked like a pre-application… for a hotel"", but there was also the ""potential for flats for the upstairs floors as well"".","['Wales', 'Newport City Council', 'Newport', 'Conservation']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/28EC/production/_132267401_fotojet.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FC19/production/_132273546_westgatecapture.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/98F5/production/_132275193_untitled-136.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['Nicholas Thomas', 'Paul Pigott']",UK,Wales

Millie-Rae, 11, has been home-educated by her mum Seana-lee in Merthyr Tydfil, since September. She is one of 5,330 children in Wales not being taught in school - the highest number on record. The Welsh government said it recognised the right of parents to teach their own children, but, in most cases, children were best served by attending school. Seana-lee originally took Millie-Rae out of school during the pandemic as she felt he daughter was not being provided with enough work. But within a few months of returning, she fell behind as she was struggling with the school environment, her mother said. When Millie-Rae began secondary school in September, she lasted just five days before refusing to go. Seana-lee said: ""Her confidence was slipping and she was starting not to go out with friends. She was getting tearful and stressed about not wanting to go back in. ""Her whole behaviour is totally different when she's in school."" Millie-Rae has recently been referred by a GP for ADHD investigations and struggled concentrating in a large, loud classroom. Seana-lee said: ""She lives in a daydream, which can be frustrating sometimes. She's very ditsy but also very clever. School didn't suit her as she needs that one-to-one attention. ""Home is a safe environment for her - she can fidget all she likes and as long as she's learning then I'm happy."" Seana-lee said she was nervous to homeschool Millie-Rae because her family were against it. ""You have to have thick skin to do this, it's not been easy,"" she said. ""Homeschooling has definitely brought her out of her shell and has given her the confidence I think she needed."" Millie-Rae said although she misses seeing her friends regularly, she goes to a weekly drama group to keep up her social life. ""Homeschooling is helping me to live and be happy. Finally, my mental health and my anxiety feels calmer,"" she said. Latest figures show that, from September 2022 to August 2023, 5,330 children were registered as being homeschooled in Wales, compared to 2,626 five years ago. There were fewer than 900 children identified as having their education at home a decade ago. Of the 22 councils in Wales, 17 have seen an increase with Carmarthenshire the highest - up from 457 two years before to 739. Figures may be inflated due to greater attempts from councils to find and record families who have opted against school. Victoria Williams, director of Smart Education Wales, a tuition centre based in Bridgend and Newport, said Covid was one of the main reasons behind the rise. ""Many are now suffering with mental health issues and social anxiety. They are struggling to fit back into society,"" she said. ""Children are also behind educationally and I think a lot of parents enjoyed the lockdowns and realised that they had the ability to educate their children themselves."" A Welsh government spokesman said about 1% of children in Wales were educated this way. ""The home educator's handbook provides advice to parents and carers who are home educating, or considering doing so,"" they added.

Here we assess some of the figures showing the pandemic over its peak years and also update some of the remaining indicators. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in May 2023 that Covid-19 was no longer a global health emergency, but said it did not mean the danger was over. In Wales, while some hospital and mortality data is still being published, other surveillance measures have been scaled back or discontinued. There was a rise in people testing positive for Covid in hospitals over the six-week period before and after Christmas, with the latest total similar to what we were seeing at the start of November. Mortality figures involving Covid for the last three months of 2023 were about 60% of the total we saw in the same period of 2022 - about 18 deaths a week. Deaths from all causes have been below normal levels in recent weeks although the trend this year was above average earlier on in 2023. Digital Health and Care Wales stopped its weekly Covid snapshot figures in the summer of 2023, although Public Health Wales (PHW) is still publishing some hospital and testing data. Numbers of in-patients with Covid by 7 January had risen for six weeks and were similar to totals seen in early November. Positive tests for Covid appear to follow a more cyclical pattern than flu or other winter viruses, which show a seasonal peak. There were 421 inpatients testing positive for Covid, including six patients in critical care in the week ending 7 January. We might expect to see more elderly people in hospital and more than half of those testing positive for Covid were over 80 and 89% were over 60. We no longer know how many of these patients are being treated primarily for Covid or happen to be incidentally testing positive while in hospital for other things. Public Health Wales is still publishing weekly data on patients who test positive for Covid in hospitals - and where they are likely to have acquired it. There were 212 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 7 January. Public Health Wales figures showed ""probably"" or ""definitely"" hospital-acquired infections in patients made up 45% of those with Covid in beds, compared to those patients who came with Covid or the origin can't be determined. Hospital-acquired infections stood at 96. There have been about 22,500 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic. The issue of patients catching Covid while in hospital was a particularly acute feature during the early days of the pandemic, when there was no vaccine. The pattern of acute respiratory infections over the past two winters suggest seasonal peaks for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But Covid infections among those in hospital show more of an undulating pattern over the course of the year. The peaks have not been as high in the winter of 2023-24 so far as they were last winter. RSV had started to rise amongst mostly young children to very high intensity levels but has dropped back to medium intensity. Flu cases in the community have been increasing and in the first week of January were of low intensity, above the baseline for the first time this winter. Health officials were keeping a close eye on Covid over the winter period, in case it added to pressures on the NHS with more seasonal viruses. This winter, there was a realistic worst scenario of just under 1,200 Covid patients in late December and a ""most likely"" of 620 patients in the early modelling from Welsh government scientists. The actual figures in late December were close to the optimistic scenario - 380 patients - and moved closer to the worst-case scenario at the end of the first week of 2024. In winter 2022-23, the peak when it came in late December reached about 650 patients, three weeks after the modelled peak for a reasonable worst scenario of 1,800 patients. The actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests by the end of the modelling period in March 2023 was tracking with the ""most likely"" scenario after following a more undulating pattern, which had taken it closer to the ""optimistic"" scenario at one point. Another snapshot of how Covid and other viruses are present is sample tests from up to 1,500 patients attending hospital each week. These tests are for a range of respiratory viruses and showed around 10% testing positive for Covid and 7.1% for flu in the most recent week. This is separate from testing for Covid or flu only or those showing symptoms. The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and has now fallen back to extremely low levels, around one or two per 100,000. Public Health Wales also recorded 14 outbreaks of Covid in care homes in the first week of January. Another measure had been analysing samples of waste water, although this due to be brought back for the winter of 2023/24 after the monitoring programme was stopped after three years in the summer of 2023. No results had been published by early January. Surveillance involving testing for infection of blood donors was also stopped at the same time. Wales did not-join a scaled-down relaunch of the long-running ONS swab survey, which had been discontinued in early 2023. The number of people who have died with Covid a contributory factor had reached 12,395 in Wales by the end of 2023. Deaths in 2023 were running at around half the number we saw in 2022. In the most recent week, up to 29 December, 20 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it mentioned on their death certificate, according to the ONS. There were deaths in half of Wales' 22 local authorities, including in four in Bridgend and Swansea. Eighteen of the deaths (90%) were due to Covid, when it was the underlying cause of death. Seventeen of the latest registrations also involved people over the age of 75. When counted by day occurring - not day registered - there were eight deaths involving Covid in the week ending 29 December. However, the most recent weekly figures are an underestimate, due to the Christmas holidays and also the lag in registrations catching up. Up to 29 December, there have been 10,152 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death. There have been just over half the number of Covid deaths so far in 2023 compared with the same period in 2022. Covid was the ninth leading cause of death in 2023 up to the end of July. The ONS counts deaths in people's homes, hospices and other settings, as well as hospitals and care homes. ONS also records so-called ""excess deaths"". This looks at average deaths from all causes overall, compared with five non-pandemic years. So since March 2020, there have been 10,332 more deaths than we might have expected to see. There have been 1,684 deaths from all causes above the non-pandemic average so far in 2023. In 2023, there have been 5% more deaths than average and deaths in people under 44 are 10% higher. Deaths in the week ending 29 December were nearly 10% below the five-year pre-pandemic average. In the last three months, deaths have been below average over seven weeks, while earlier in the year there were more weeks above average. There were 485 deaths from all causes - 52 fewer than we might expect to see in the latest week. Covid accounted for 4.1% of all deaths in Wales in the latest week, more than the proportion in England (2.3%), where deaths were below average by 9.5%. Analysis by ONS found excess deaths - when deaths due to Covid were excluded - were 103 (-0.1%) below average over the whole pandemic period to the end of December 2022. But non-Covid excess deaths were running above average for eight successive months at the end of 2022, totalling 1,653. At a local level, Monmouthshire (15%) and Caerphilly  (13%) had the highest proportion of excess deaths. Monmouthshire saw the 12th highest proportion of excess deaths across England and Wales in 2022. Both Rhondda Cynon Taf, Vale of Glamorgan and Bridgend saw deaths below average. Nearly a fifth (17.2%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes. There has been 14 deaths involving Covid among care home residents registered over the last three months. There were three deaths in the latest week out of 95 deaths from all causes. Care Inspectorate Wales reported that deaths peaked in May 2020 and before it stopped publishing data it was notified of 2,339 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid up to the end of June 2023. There were 726 deaths above the five-year average in care homes in Wales in April 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. There were also high numbers of excess deaths in the winter of 2020-21, when the vaccination programme was only just starting. Altogether, in the three-year period from January 2020 there were nearly 1,500 excess deaths in care homes in Wales. ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021 found mortality rates lower in Wales in male residents than in England or any English region. The same occurred in 2022. Covid was the second leading cause of death in care home residents after dementia in 2021, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths. In 2022, Covid dropped to being the fifth leading cause of death in care home residents in 2022, accounting for 4.5% of deaths. There were nearly twice as many deaths due to flu and pneumonia in Wales than due to Covid in 2023. There have been more Covid than flu deaths in only three weeks over the last year. Covid-19 was the 32nd leading cause of death in Wales in July 2023, after being the 19th leading cause in June. This was the lowest ranking as cause of death for two years and the third lowest since the pandemic began. It was behind accidental poisoning and appendicitis. Monthly mortality analysis - which was also discontinued at the end of July - showed there were 21 deaths due to Covid in July - 0.8% of all registered deaths. This was fewer than in June when there were 35 deaths. Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 29 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 1.1% of all deaths registered in July. So far in 2023, up to the end of July, ill-defined conditions - which include old age and frailty - was the leading cause of excess deaths, nearly 41% above normal levels. Heart disease was again the leading cause of death in July 2023 in Wales. Flu and pneumonia again ranked sixth but below normal levels. Up to the end of July 2023, heart disease was the leading cause of death - although still below average - and Covid was the ninth leading cause. Heart disease ranked as the leading cause of death for 2022 as a whole. Covid was the seventh leading cause of death in 2022, with a mortality rate of 38.5 deaths per 100,000, after being the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease in 2021. It was the leading cause of death at the height of the pandemic in 2020. It was the sixth leading cause of death in men in 2022 (4%) and fifth leading cause in men over 80 (5.1%) but did not feature as a leading cause of death in women. Around 78% of deaths due to Covid in 2023 have been in the over 75s, according to the ONS. Analysis of mortality from the start of the pandemic until the end of July 2023 shows the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is slightly higher in Wales (102.2 deaths per 100,000), than England on 101.5 deaths per 100,000. Scotland (9.56) and Northern Ireland (93.2) are both lower in the 41 months to the end of July. The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales. It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England. When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales. Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 70% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in 2023. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the start of the pandemic, 83% of deaths with Covid on death certificates can be said to be due to Covid. So, there were 10,108 deaths due to Covid by 29 December 2023 in Wales. Covid has been ""suspected"" by doctors in around 4% of cases. A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Merthyr Tydfil have the highest mortality rates over the course of the pandemic in Wales. By 29 December, RCT had reached a total of 1,235 deaths, with the highest crude mortality rate - 516.7 deaths per 100,000. This was the seventh highest crude mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales. Deaths involving Covid can also be shown to be hitting people living in deprived areas, usually associated with poorer health, harder than in the least deprived areas of Wales. Merthyr with 302 deaths (512.9 deaths per 100,000) was the eighth highest. Bridgend was 13th (505.7deaths per 100,000) in England and Wales. Cardiff (1,225) has the second highest number of deaths in Wales, although because of its population size, its mortality rate is one of the lowest in Wales. So far in 2023, Conwy, Bridgend and Powys have the highest Covid mortality rates in Wales, based on the sizes of their populations. Six of RCT's communities were in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further. At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 127 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the three years of the pandemic up to the end of July 2023. This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 55.5 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 84.3. The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West in Rhondda Cynon Taf, with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid. This was followed by Sandfields in Neath Port Talbot and Porth East and Ynyshir in RCT (55 deaths each), by the end of 2021. When translated into mortality rates, based on population size, Gwersyllt West and Summerhill in Wrexham was the highest at 742.6 deaths per 100,000 - or 44 deaths over the two years. This was followed by Tonyrefail West, Port Talbot East and Llanelli Bigyn in Carmarthenshire. All communities of Wales have now had at least two deaths during the pandemic. The lowest number of deaths at a community level were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan Conwy. At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales. In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000: this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales. There are figures to compare relative excess deaths in different European countries. Bulgaria has the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate - 18.2% higher than normal - and Norway the lowest, 4.1% below average. Wales was 3.7% above average in June 2021 and then 2.1% above average in July 2022 - ranked 21st out of 33 nations. For those aged under 65, Wales was 4.8% above average (ranked 12th) and 1.5% above average (joint 24th) in the over-65s. Wales also saw excess mortality in more than half of weeks over the period. The 2023-24 booster programme had by early January reached more than 709,000 people. That included more than two thirds of over 65s and 85% of care home residents. Numbers of NHS staff who took up offers of a vaccine booster was down on earlier stages of the programme. Just over half of all those eligible across different groups had taken up the offer, perhaps reflecting numbers who felt they had immunity from having had the virus more than once. More than 9.8m doses of Covid vaccine have been administered in Wales since December 2020. Analysis of vaccine uptake has consistently found gaps between people living in deprived areas and also people from black, Asian and mixed groups. The offers of the primary course of vaccine to anyone over five, available since December 2020, ended in June 2023. The dominant variant in Wales has been Omicron for two years and 633 positive test results have been sequenced in the last month. Because of the ending of mass testing in April 2022, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more. More than two thirds of those analysed in the week have been the ""Pirola"" BA.2.86 sub-variant. From summer 2020, the ONS organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which latterly saw people being sent test kits by post. It became the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing in March 2022. By this measure, infections were estimated to have peaked in Wales in April 2022 with 232,000 (around 8%) estimated to be affected. However, the survey was ""paused"" at the end of March 2023, as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) worked to confirm a surveillance approach which was ""proportionate and cost effective"" to living with Covid. The health minister expressed her ""deep disappointment and concern"" about the ""loss of this important source of surveillance"". and the break in data gathering at a time infections were still being recorded in Wales. But the Welsh government decided not to re-join a scaled-down version of the survey, which was relaunched in winter 2023, testing around 29,000 people. This suggested 2.7% of people in England and Scotland had Covid in the week ending 3 January 2024. Data from the infection survey, before it was wound up, also suggested 94.6% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection. The estimate was 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies in February 2023. At the higher threshold, 79.5% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and nearly three quarters in those aged 16 to 24 and 92.3% of the 75-79 age group. A test of blood donors in Wales found more than 80% prevalence of the N antibody, indicating a natural infection from having Covid, and a 99.9% prevalence of the S antibody from either infection or having had the Covid vaccine. The number of people who were reporting they had long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected in early March 2023 was estimated to be around 57,000. This was just under 2% of the population who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid. A total of 94,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, 24% said it had ""a lot"" of impact on their daily lives and 52% said it had little impact. An estimated 3.14% of people in Wales reported having long Covid - this was slightly less than in Scotland and the West Midlands and north west and north east of England. Just under 2% reported long Covid after a year - fewer than England and most of its regions and Scotland. Two thirds in Wales reporting long Covid said they had symptoms of weakness and tiredness and more than half a shortness of breath. Nearly half had muscle ache. This data set has now been curtailed, with the end of the ONS infection survey. A separate survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50. Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks. Fatigue, ""brain fog"" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate that potentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid. In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid. But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales. This analysis was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic. With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from £21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to £5,769 per case by January 2022. Of this, more than £4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid. The waves of the pandemic saw dozens of patients in critical care with Covid. This reached 164 patients at the first wave peak in April 2020, while the second wave peak in January peaked at 150 patients. As the vaccination programme kicked in, there were only 40 patients at the winter peak of 2021-22 and then 24 patients with Covid in critical care at the peak of winter 2022-23. For the final Digital Health and Care Wales figures, there were five patients in critical care with Covid on 12 July 2023, with one of those recovering from Covid. A long-running study of more than 500 Welsh critical care patients with Covid gave insights into the virus. The mortality rate was about 34%, including those who died later on a general ward. About 63% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived were spending less time in critical care - an average of seven days - than early in the pandemic. Around 60% of patients had been admitted to critical care with Covid the primary reason for treatment. The average age of those admitted in 2022-23 was 58, and just over half were men. Half were from more deprived parts of Wales. About 26% were under 50. At its peaks, there were between 120 and 140 admissions a day on average to hospitals for patients with Covid. By the time Digital Health and Care Wales halted their data gathering, there were five admissions of people testing positive for Covid on 12 July 2023, with numbers in single figures for the previous three months. Figures had been low and, for the first time since the pandemic began, no Covid admissions were recorded on 24 January 2023. The previous low had been just one admission on two days in May and June 2022. Over 18 months from the start of 2022, hospitals in Wales were asked to track how many of their patients testing positively for Covid were actually being primarily treated for it. Over this period, 13% of patients on average with Covid were being actively or primarily treated for it. There were some differences between health boards over definitions so care needs to be taken in how we interpret this. But since the autumn of 2022, the proportion of ""active"" Covid cases was usually in single figures. The Icnarc intensive care study has found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus during 2022 (41%), compared with the period before (nearly 86%). The mortality rate was 31% for those with ""primary"" Covid, compared with 25% for those with incidental Covid. When we look at infections at a community level, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas. This is noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes. At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate - the number of positive results from all PCR tests taken - reached 51.6%. Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest. Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high. There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021. Between January and March 2022 there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive. In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results in winter 2021-22. Nearly 8.9 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out since the start of the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020. For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020. This ended at the start of April 2022, although it is still taking place in hospitals and also for some vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes. There are around 2,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, about half in the over 60s. This compares to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak. Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes. Testing that was processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place. There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy. Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020. Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow tests will only be provided in limited circumstances. School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded. We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid. Absenteeism for any reason continued to rise, including those persistently absent. The percentage of secondary school pupils who were persistently absent had tripled to 16.3% from 2018-19 - the last full academic year before Covid - and 2022-23. This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years. Analysis of these figures showed 10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds. The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - had been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid. However, it is has now been phased out as a measure. Expressed within a range, if it was above 1, this indicated that infections were growing. The range for the last estimate in December 2022 was between 0.9 and 1.2, suggesting infections were rising. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another nine and 12 people would be infected. In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by £373 million. That worked out at £156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending. The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at £628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system.","['Cardiff', 'Newport', 'Merthyr Tydfil', 'Wales', 'NHS Wales', 'Mountain Ash', 'Coronavirus']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B26A/production/_132247654_covid2024_gettyimages-1441707430.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9701/production/_132275683_walescard-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/E521/production/_132275685_covidmodel.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/968/cpsprodpb/18351/production/_130535199_1300438a-34b7-45fa-b240-ca3c0dc895e3.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/EF65/production/_132258216_deathswaves.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/866/cpsprodpb/13D85/production/_132258218_onsdeathswaves.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/957/cpsprodpb/A52D/production/_132258224_excessdeathsweek.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/639/cpsprodpb/08ED/production/_132258220_deathstable1.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/912/cpsprodpb/570D/production/_132258222_walesmapmortality.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1718D/production/_125750649_mortalityrateswalesmap20-21.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1819B/production/_128151789_excessdeathseurope.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/E8B6/production/_130447595_caseratefull1.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/A3DF/production/_124115914_covidmsoaapril2022-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/185A/production/_128243260_positivity.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/67B4/production/_128984562_casesage.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/136D6/production/_130447597_covidtesting.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/94C2/production/_109028083_1px_white_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3BB6/production/_123968251_ppe31mar-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/7A0C/production/_112244213_soundsheaderv1-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/A11C/production/_112244214_soundsfooter-nc.png']",['Steve Duffy'],UK,Wales

Manx National Heritage (MNH) withdrew its previous plans for developing the entrance to the Victorian waterwheel. The local authority had objected and said it would request a redesign, while a local historian criticised the plans. MNH said it would now hold talks about changes to the design before making a second bid for planning permission. The original plans would have seen the existing turnstile and kiosk replaced with a ""lightweight"" building made from insulated panels. MNH said its aim was to ""develop enhanced visitor facilities, creating a new visitor arrival point with a retail experience, also providing improved staff welfare facilities"". It said the decision was taken to revise the plans for an ""affordable, low maintenance and contemporary visitor welcome hub"" - but this time with feedback taken onboard from interested parties before moving ahead. The plans, which would be paid for from charitable funds, had been criticised for not being in keeping with the heritage of the 170-year-old attraction, which is the largest working waterwheel of its kind in the world. An MNH statement read: ""The use of similar modern structures as Visitor Welcome centres is commonplace at heritage sites across the UK and further afield. ""Well-travelled visitors are accustomed to, and expect high levels of service, access to information and visitor facilities which include retail opportunities. ""Welcome hubs of this nature have become a vital component in providing access to heritage sites, whilst ensuring a focus on the needs of the modern-day visitor."" The plans coincide with the ongoing £1.6m refurbishment of the 72ft (22m) diameter wheel, which will conclude in the autumn after repairs to the Laxey Wheel's T-Rocker and rod duct are completed.

Kate Brunner KC said the probe had gathered ""some very frank evidence"" and had reached ""very robust conclusions"". There had previously been a call for a statutory inquiry to be held to ensure its independence and allow it to compel evidence. But Ms Brunner said the team had full access to all the evidence it required. The review, which covered the period from December 2019 up to the removal of restrictions in April 2022, made a total of 31 recommendations. Although the Public Accounts Committee had originally called for a full public inquiry, the Council of Ministers received the backing of Tynwald members for an independent review instead. However, the review's terms of reference called for it to consider whether a public inquiry was needed. Ms Brunner said the independence of her review was ""an absolutely central part of my processes right from the start"". She said a statutory inquiry was not recommended as the required evidence had been provided. But she said issues with data storage within the government systems had made the review process ""significantly harder"", as there was a ""chaotic element to much of the documentation that the review was faced with"". However, she said she had found no evidence of ""documents being deliberately manipulated or deliberately withheld"". Ms Brunner said she would like to see the recommendations ""taken seriously"", as each one had ""come out of very careful research and very detailed findings"". She said: ""I hope it will be used, I hope the recommendations will be followed.

In a letter, the Commissioner for Standards for the Channel Islands said she had ""given careful consideration"" to the matter. Commissioner Melissa McCullough said it was ""not an option that would work best"" to tackle the issue. Ms McCullough said she wanted a survey launched to ""get a sense of the magnitude of the problem"". In the letter, written to Shelaine Green, the chair of Women in Public Life, Ms McCullough wrote: ""While these issues are very serious, and I share your view that what was expressed could be detrimental to the wellbeing of members and civil servants, the fact that I have received no complaints related to alleged unacceptable behaviour creates a problem when it comes to launching an investigation. ""That problem, in the main, is that neither civil servants nor members can be compelled to provide evidence of this nature. ""It appears to me that, understandably, there may be a hesitancy by both members and civil servants to do so. ""This could be due to fear of the consequences to them professionally and/or personally of speaking up, among other reasons."" Ms McCullough said she did not think it would be appropriate to ""embark on a quest"" to find those willing to come forward. She said ""proposed changes"" to the code of conduct were expected to be debated soon - which she said included helpful definitions to remind members of the importance of their behaviour towards other members and colleagues. Also, the commissioner recommended training for members, specifically on inappropriate behaviours. Ms McCullough said this training would be ""useful in promoting an environment with zero tolerance for such behaviours"".

Ferryspeed is set to put its freight prices up by 4% from next month. It follows Condor Ferries raising its freight charges to 10% above inflation due to ""significantly above inflation rises"" in fees and the cost of living. Martyn Langlois, from Ferryspeed, said traders across the islands may have to pass rises on to their customers. ""I think we will always try our best to ensure that prices are kept as low as possible but it is inevitable that, in fact, if we ourselves receive additional costs, you can't be forever absorbing. ""It has to be passed on,"" he said. Mr Langlois said the company had tried its best ""to get the prices down from Condor but unfortunately that didn't happen"". Condor Ferries said the rise was above inflation because it had absorbed cost increases from suppliers over the past three years, with CEO John Napton saying its financial situation had been ""impacted during the pandemic period"". Alex Argo, from Ideal Furnishings, said the increases were tough for businesses. ""They can't go up too much more because we've got to be in business and try and sell our product to keep people's livelihoods going. ""I have staff so we just have to see how the future turns out,"" he said. John Bampkin, CEO of building supplier Norman Piette, said the increases were impacting construction supplies during a time when the island needed new homes. He said: ""To put this type of increase on the material side of that construction will impact further the affordability of those houses. ""It's just going to make it more expensive before a spade is even put in the ground."" Jonathan Wilson, from Omega Group Construction, said the impact of the rising costs was unclear. ""I suppose the cost of living is so high at the moment so I guess the kind of scare for the consumer is how are they going to afford these costs,"" he said.

Deputy Kristina Moore has outlined her top priorities for 2024 which include building more homes. She also committed to improving the island's health services and to ""do more"" for children and families. Investments would also be made to promote ""economic growth and productivity"", she said. During a meeting with business officials in St Helier, Ms Moore said she wanted to give islanders confidence in Jersey's economy and future. She also addressed issues within government, including the rejection of the Les Sablons project - which was then approved in December. Ms Moore said the initial decision was ""disappointing"". She added: ""Yes, I was annoyed by it but I recognise that it created an uncomfortable moment for some of my colleagues and caused the public to question our unity. ""My job is to keep us all on track and ensure that such issues do not arise again."" The Chief Minister will face a vote of no confidence on 16 January after Deputy Tom Binet listed a series of what he considered ""failings"" by Ms Moore. Ms Moore said the government was ""faced with a difficult economic environment"" but that this provided them with ""many opportunities, as well as challenges"". She highlighted that the population had lowered more than expected in 2021 and that the working age population had also decreased. She said: ""That decline is a huge worry for business... but it should also be a huge worry for every islander because we have full employment and our public finances depend on income tax. ""We should all be obsessing more about practical ways to improve the productivity of the workforce by embracing technology and less about the ebbs and flows of immigration. ""We've already announced specific grant support for all business in this area and a tax incentive scheme to encourage reg-tech in financial services in order to boost productivity."" To improve the issue, the government will give every employer an extra work licence to employ people who are not from Jersey. A ""strain"" to the health and care sectors was flagged due to the rise in senior islanders, causing bed blocking in the island's only hospital, but Ms Moore said the government was ""on the case"" to keep rising numbers at a ""more reasonable"" level. She said the focus on the long-term health strategy, alongside delivering a new hospital, required the government to be ""thoughtful about the issues on the horizon"". To prioritise children and families, Ms Moore said a new town school would be built, hot meals would be provided to every primary school pupil and an increase in the number of foster places would be made. Investments would also be made to ""put the fun back"" into Fort Regent - which fell into disuse after the new government scrapped previous plans to regenerate it. Ms Moore said she expected islanders to ""hold the Council of Ministers and I to account on delivering those goals"". She said: ""It has not been easy - with external and internal events affecting our ability to deliver effectively - but we will accelerate progress this year. ""Through collaboration with islanders and industry, the Council of Ministers is focused on delivering and prioritising projects that get results and we will deliver."" In order to make haste on the new projects, Ms Moore said the government would be reducing the number of public sector projects to give it the ""capacity to deliver"" on those ""desperately"" needed - returning £30m into the island's rainy day fund.

It’s not a happy place at the moment,"" said Constable Karen Shenton-Stone.She said the optimism she felt following Jersey’s 2022 election had turned to disappointment.A year of disagreements and tension amongst ministers saw the resignations of Assistant Chief Minister Constable Andy Jehan and the island’s most senior civil servant, Suzanne Wylie.And now the Chief Minister, Deputy Kristina Moore, is facing a vote of no confidence brought by her former Infrastructure Minister, Deputy Tom Binet, who has criticised the culture within her government and accused her of a ""woeful lack of leadership"". ""There’s got to be a change,"" said Ms Shenton-Stone, the Chair of the Privileges and Procedures Committee, which is responsible, amongst other things, for ensuring States members adhere to a code of conduct.""Say this government stays in: they have to really, really listen and see that there has been a vote of no confidence - something has gone seriously wrong.""And they’ve got to wake up and think, ‘we’ve got to live by example,’ and ‘for heaven’s sake, let’s pull together and get on with each other.'"" Political commentator John Henwood agrees that the chief minister should take responsibility for setting the atmosphere within the States Assembly.But he does not believe Deputy Moore is doing enough to set the right tone.""I think, with respect to her, she probably thinks she is, but I think not very many people would agree,"" he said.""There doesn’t seem to be a real understanding of what leadership is.""As I understand it, there is no collegiate feel about the Council of Ministers, and that can only really come from the top.""Mr Henwood said the government has not been as transparent and accountable as it had promised it would be, citing continued uncertainty over the total cost of plans for hospital facilities on multiple sites as one of a number of ""significant issues about which we have not been told, when perhaps we should"".And having kept a close eye on Jersey politics since the 1960s, he said ""it’s hard to think of a time other than in crisis, like Covid, when it’s been worse"". Meanwhile, as discussions between politicians continue behind the scenes ahead of next week’s vote on her future, members of Ms Moore’s top team have publicly expressed their loyalty.""The idea of upending an entire government because somebody doesn’t like somebody else’s style is a really poor place to be,"" said Deputy Kirsten Morel,  Deputy Chief Minister, who warns a vote to topple the island’s leadership would lead to instability at a time when Jersey is facing a number of challenges.""As a Council of Ministers we’re doing a really good job in moving forward, putting things right from previous governments that haven’t been done.""This does take time. I believe you’re going to see in 2024 an enormous lot of delivery taking place.""Meanwhile, Deputy Lucy Stephenson, an Assistant Chief Minister, said Mr Binet had been a “destabilising influence” within government.""I think if they’re able to move on without that there it could be a positive thing,” she said.""Every chief minister has faced a vote of no confidence at some point.""I have no doubt she will build back stronger from it."" But while some islanders agree the unrest currently gripping Jersey’s States Assembly is the result of personality clashes, others believe the island’s unique political system is to blame.""What the island asked for in 2022, they asked for change,"" said Rowland Huelin, an Assistant Chief Minister in John Le Fondre’s government, who favours a move towards party politics.""The change they got was putting different people in the same seats, with the same processes, expecting a different outcome.

The Labour leader was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013. Asked by the BBC if he should have been more curious, he said the CPS handled four million cases in that period. Politicians with responsibility for the Post Office over the past 20 years have been criticised amid the fallout surrounding the scandal. One prosecution on the basis of information from the Post Office's faulty Horizon IT system resulted in a conviction for theft and a 21-month sentence: another in convictions for theft and fraud. In a BBC interview, Sir Keir said that, while he was head of the CPS, he had 7,000 staff. He said the idea the head of the organisation would have been curious about all the prosecutions being handled was ""unreal"". ""I didn't see these particular cases. I don't even know yet what they were about, whether they come within the cohort that is of concern,"" he added. Earlier, Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: ""No case of a prosecution of a postmaster came across Keir Starmer's desk as director of public prosecutions."" He added: ""Frankly, I think it's appalling that the Conservatives have chosen to try and sling mud at their political opponents, whether that's Keir Starmer in the Labour Party or Ed Davey in the Liberal Democrat Party, rather than say 'hang on a minute, this is a grave injustice, let's sort it out'. ""Instead of the mud-slinging, I'd urge the government to get on with the job... to get justice for these postmasters, fair compensation for these postmasters, as quickly as possible."" Between 1999 and 2015, the vast majority of prosecutions of hundreds of sub-postmasters, when faults with the Horizon system wrongly made it appear that money had gone missing, were conducted by the Post Office itself, rather than the CPS. There were more than 900 convictions. Only 93 have been overturned so far. Under plans set out by the government on Wednesday, legislation will be introduced to overturn these convictions, with affected sub-postmasters being asked to sign a declaration that they committed no offence, so they can then claim compensation. In the past 10 days, Sir Ed Davey has come under repeated fire from a number of Tory MPs over his time as postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, in the coalition government. In May 2010, he refused to meet former sub-postmaster Alan Bates, who led the campaign to expose the Post Office scandal, saying he did not believe it ""would serve any useful purpose"". He did meet Mr Bates in October 2010 - and the Lib Dems say he was the first postal affairs minister to hold such a meeting since campaigners began pressing for talks in 2003. However, the Lib Dem leader has said he ""deeply regrets not realising that the Post Office was lying to him"", and not asking executives ""tougher questions"". The Lib Dems said: ""The scandal took place over many years from 1999, during which time different governments and ministers from all parties were in post.""","['Keir Starmer', 'Post Office Inquiry', 'Post Office Ltd', 'Crown Prosecution Service', 'Ed Davey']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5BD4/production/_132280532_8ebde58b66171c68e9ada6c98a77d1d30f14551b-1.jpg'],['Chas Geiger'],UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944687,Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing further pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill.,2024-01-11,"Rishi Sunak is facing further pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill. The prime minister is trying to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda after the Supreme Court ruled the earlier scheme was unlawful. More than 40 MPs on the right of the party, including Liz Truss, argue the legislation must be toughened up. But former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, has backed three changes which would tone down some measures. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, former prime minister Ms Truss said: ""We need to crack down on illegal migration and remove the loopholes being exploited by activist lawyers. ""It's essential the legislation we are passing is watertight. That's why I am backing amendments to the Bill."" Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned last month over the legislation and is co-ordinating a series of rebel amendments, has warned the bill as it stands is ""guaranteed to fail"". Illegal migrants would continue to successfully challenge their removal in court, in a fresh ""merry-go-round"" of appeals, he said. The government insists the legislation, the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill which returns to the Commons next Tuesday, will allow only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. But the amendments backed by Sir Robert would delete clauses from the bill declaring Rwanda ""a safe country"", disapplying the Human Rights Act, and forcing courts to disregard interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The One Nation group is the largest single faction within the Conservative parliamentary party. It says more than 100 MPs are members, almost a third of the total. It argues that the UK's human rights obligations in international law must be respected. Former first secretary of state Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he had been assured the bill would not be strengthened. ""The prime minister's looked me in the eye and said that he doesn't want to go any further,"" he told the New Statesman. The Rwandan government has said it will pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said the government would carry on talking to MPs and ""carefully consider"" amendments put forward. It had worked to ensure the bill was ""robust"", No 10 added. Before Christmas, Mr Sunak comfortably saw off a Tory rebellion over the bill, when it cleared its first Commons hurdle by a majority of 44 votes. But the scale of party divisions on the issue has again been highlighted in recent days - with a number of former cabinet ministers, including Suella Braverman, Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, backing the Jenrick amendments. Nearly two years after Boris Johnson's government first announced plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, none has been sent to the east African country. The bill aims to stop flights being grounded by legal action by declaring that, in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country. It would enable ministers to ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight there while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it would still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore ECHR injunctions, blocking flights. The prime minister has promised to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and argues his Rwanda scheme will prove a significant deterrent. Labour says the scheme is a hugely expensive ""gimmick"" which will not work, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused Mr Sunak of being ""taken hostage by his own party"". It says it would tackle illegal migration by prioritising the smashing of people-smuggling gangs. The government has a working Commons majority over other parties and independent MPs of 56, implying that 29 Conservative MPs would need to vote against the bill to defeat it. But in practice that majority is larger because some independent MPs usually vote with the government and others tend to be absent. In addition to this, some Tory rebels are likely to abstain, while others may also vote with the government. If the bill does clear its Commons stages next week, it is likely to face prolonged opposition in the Lords. Meanwhile, the Home Office has published a report on ""safe and legal routes"" for migrants seeking to enter the UK, but it does not list any new routes. Campaigners have long argued that the government needs to provide safe routes for people seeking refuge from war and oppression, to help tackle illegal migration. During debates on the Illegal Migration Act, which became law in July 2023 and bars anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum, ministers promised to ""specify additional safe and legal routes"". No 10 said there were already a significant number of routes and its priority was to secure the UK's borders. ""While the compassion of the UK is clearly unlimited, our capacity is not,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. In a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the report reaffirmed the government's ""commitment to providing safe and legal routes for those most in need"". ""As we get control on numbers, we will keep under review whether we are able to do more to support vulnerable refugees and whether we need to consider new safe and legal routes,"" he added. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon described the report as ""woefully inadequate with no meaningful commitment to expand safe routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Syria, and those fleeing repressive regimes in countries such as Iran"". ""By simply focusing on describing the existing limited schemes, the government has completely overlooked the urgent need to reduce dangerous Channel crossings by providing safe passage to our shores,"" he said.","['Rishi Sunak', 'UK immigration', 'Conservative Party', 'Migration']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/732F/production/_132278492_cd53fcc6dc65219bfde197e50b68fcb2e5a0dae1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C14F/production/_132278494_49df87243c4fd2e37537c4637e12e27615f254c3.jpg']",['Chas Geiger'],UK,Politics

The Labour leader said tooth decay was the top reason children between six and 10 go to hospital and that the government had to act. Labour would run the scheme in breakfast clubs in all primary schools. The Conservatives accused Labour of ""borrowing"" existing policies. Rolling out a national supervised toothbrushing programme for three to five-year-olds will cost £9m a year, Labour said, and would be funded byabolishing the non-dom tax status.For children not old enough to attend school, the supervision would be provided in nurseries. Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said: ""We [have] already provided tool kits for local authorities to use for toothbrushing lessons across their local authority areas."" The government were also already ""already funding breakfast clubs around the country"", Ms Atkins added. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Atkins said the government ""very much believe in supporting our parents and supporting our families,"" rather than mandating supervised sessions. Dr Camilla Kingdon, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""At present, the UK has some of the worst child health outcomes in Europe, and child health inequalities continue to widen. ""It is therefore welcome to see the Labour party's intention to publish a dedicated child health action plan, which outlines many of the calls paediatricians have been making repeatedly - including tackling paediatric waiting times, supporting the health prevention agenda and providing support for child mental health."" Labour's Child Health Action Plan would also ban flavoured vapes aimed at children and implement the 21:00 watershed for junk food advertising on television. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that children in the UK ""are shorter, fatter and less happy than kids in other countries because we've got a childhood health crisis brewing"". The UK is estimated to have more obese children than France, Germany, Poland and Slovenia. The average height of five-year-old boys and girls have fallen down international rankings since 1985. But NHS data shows the average height for boys in reception class in England has increased 70mm since 2009/10, and 60mm for girls. Sir Keir also pledged to prioritise tackling child obesity and to introduce specialist mental health support for children in every school. The Labour leader said that children were ""the biggest casualty"" of the Tories' ""sticking-plaster politics of the past 14 years"". ""Labour will end the scandal of children being held back by poor health and regional inequalities, by slashing waits for mental health treatment and hospital appointment, putting prevention first, and fixing NHS dentistry."" Asked if he minded his policies being labelled ""the nanny state"", Sir Keir said: ""I'm absolutely up for that fight."" Speaking during a visit to Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, he said that when it came to obesity or tooth decay in children, ""for a government to say 'well that's none of our business' I just think is fundamentally wrong"". ""If anyone wants to fight me on this question of the nanny state or common sense - bring it on."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""While it's good to see that supervising toothbrushing won't be a part of the school day itself, or an expectation of teachers, we remain somewhat sceptical about how this will work in practice. ""There is no doubt that, as a nation, we should be focused on improving children's dental health, but this will certainly need further thought and additional funding.""","['Labour Party', 'Wes Streeting', 'Dentistry']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/35A7/production/_91353731_m7800377-dental_examination-spl.jpg'],['Sam Francis'],UK,Politics

The Labour leader made a return trip to the kingdom whilst attending the COP28 climate conference held in Dubai. His latest declaration of financial interests shows the trip for him and three staffers cost £25,508. The COP28 organisers also paid £765 for him to travel by car at the conference. Sir Keir said he attended the COP summit, hosted by the United Arab Emirates in its largest city of Dubai, in his capacity as Labour leader. He has previously defended his attendance as a non-government figure, saying it was ""in the British national interest"" for him to go. ""If there is an election next year that we are privileged enough to win, then it's very important that we go all-out for clean power [in] 2030,"" he added. He has previously said he used his meeting with the Emir of Qatar in Doha, the country's capital, to discuss the situation in Gaza as well as the ""vital cooperation"" between Qatar and the UK. Now his latest declaration shows his return journey there from Dubai was paid for by Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The return specifies that the journey was made in a ""private jet"" - although the type and owner of the aircraft is not specified. Labour has previously vowed to curb the use of UK-funded private jets by ministers undertaking official trips to ""save millions of pounds"" for British taxpayers. In a speech to the party's autumn conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves attacked Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's ""private jet habit"". Although the trip to Doha was not funded by British taxpayers, it could prove awkward for Sir Keir, with climate campaigners criticising Mr Sunak for making trips in private planes on climate grounds.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67942277,"Chris Mason: Justice at last, but plenty more questions remain",This time last week the ITV drama on the Post Office scandal hadn't even finished.,2024-01-11,"This time last week the ITV drama on the Post Office scandal hadn't even finished. And now the government has announced a change in the law with massive constitutional, political, practical and financial implications. The wheels of politics suddenly whizzing around, after the wheels of justice creaked at a glacial rate for ages. What we are seeing is near unprecedented. Westminster interfering in the independent decisions of the courts. And all this after a generational failure taking in a national institution, the Post Office, three political parties and the Japanese technology company Fujitsu, just for starters. Why? Because the TV drama managed to capture something, in its execution, its casting, its timing, which captured the public mood and, finally, argue campaigners, seized the attention of the government. One cabinet minister told me that watching the series with family over the holidays had prompted sharp questions for them: a demand to know what they were going to do about it. It is that, multiplied many million times over, that helps explain this seemingly transformational moment for those who have spent years and years demanding justice. A lot of people were let down for a long time. So the breadth of questions and the breadth of people facing questions is quite something. There are Labour folk who were ministers way back when in the noughties, now trawling their records and government records to remind themselves how they acted, what they did, what they were told, who they met. There are former Liberal Democrat ministers from the coalition years too, and Conservative ministers as well. But, this being an election year, those facing the loudest questions are those in the most prominent political positions, who occupied other prominent positions during this scandal. So, the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has faced questions over his spell as Post Office Minister, one of over a dozen occupiers of that role during the scandal. And there have been questions too for Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader. Sir Keir, as he frequently reminds people, was the Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales from 2008 to 2013, and so led the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS's role in the prosecution of sub-postmasters was minimal as the vast majority were private prosecutions brought by the Post Office. It brought three cases against those who ran post offices during Sir Keir's time running the organisation. Labour say the cases were never brought to his attention and during his five years in charge the CPS oversaw four million cases in total. Others pose questions for Rishi Sunak during his time as chancellor and prime minister. The delays to compensation, new government contracts for Fujitsu and the criticism of some former sub-postmasters who say the compensation now being offered is inadequate. Campaigners say government after government failed them, as did the Post Office and as did Fujitsu. There are plenty of questions for plenty of people, and plenty more to come.

The party claims GB News hosts Nigel Farage and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg targeted opposition politicians but overlooked Tory MPs' role in the scandal. Sir Ed, the Lib Dem leader, has been criticised for his initial refusal to meet campaigners while minister responsible for the Post Office. GB News has been contacted for comment. Separately, Labour have accused the Conservatives of trying to ""sling mud"" at opposition politicians over the Post Office IT scandal. While the vast majority of prosecutions of sub-postmasters were private prosecutions pursued by the Post Office, it emerged on Wednesday that three were prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service while Sir Keir Starmer was director of public prosecutions. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think what's actually happened in the last week or two in particular is the government have tried to sling mud at everybody else. ""They're trying it with Keir Starmer, they've tried it with Ed Davey, and I think it's unedifying actually."" Mr Streeting said ""ultimate responsibility"" for the scandal lies with the Post Office, and Fujitsu - who made the faulty Horizon software that made it look like money was missing. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, wrote to Ofcom claiming Mr Farage launched ""a fictitious monologue"" about Sir Ed which contained ""a number of factual inaccuracies"" in his show on Tuesday. ""The Liberal Democrats were offered no right of reply. This therefore breaches both the accuracy and impartiality elements of the Ofcom code,"" Ms Cooper said. Sir Ed has faced some criticism for initially refusing to meet Alan Bates, the post office operator who led the campaign against the injustice. He subsequently became the first minister to then meet Mr Bates. Mr Farage, the honorary president of Reform UK, the new name for the Brexit Party, hosts a daily evening news show on GB News, which airs before former Tory cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg's  programme. Ms Cooper accused Sir Jacob, of taking aim at ""political leaders from other parties about the scandal, whilst not mentioning his own party's role in this devastating miscarriage of justice"". She said there was no mention that the Conservatives oversaw ex-post office chief Paula Vennells receiving a CBE and ""then made her a non-executive board member in the government"". ""Nor did he mention that the governments of which he was a part dragged their feet over financial redress for the victims,"" she wrote. Ms Cooper said she had no confidence that Lee Anderson, the Tory deputy chair, would be impartial during his GB News show on Friday. Mr Anderson used a question in the Commons to call for Sir Ed to quit on Wednesday. ""This is a general election year. British democracy deserves better than bias, misleading and at times, frankly absurd news reporting of important matters,"" she added. GB News has faced a series of Ofcom investigations into alleged breaches of the code - often stemming from shows hosted by politicians. In September, Ofcom found an interview by Tory MPs Philip Davies and Esther McVey with the chancellor ahead of the Spring Budget breached impartiality rules.

Alex Burghart claimed ""high end"" AI specialists were willing to take a pay cut to work for the government. They are being recruited to work on systems to cut waste and improve productivity, he added. It comes after a string of high-profile IT procurement disasters such as the Post Office Horizon system. Asked how the government could avoid repeating mistakes of the past when it came to AI, the Cabinet Office minister said: ""The approach that we have chosen to take with this work is very much in-house. ""We have gone through a period where in-house has often been balanced or completely outstripped by outsourcing."" But he said he wanted a team that understood ""nascent"" AI technology and could ""help us build things"" that could be used across government. Speaking at Centre for Policy Studies event in London, the Conservative MP said the government was in the process of recruiting 30 AI experts. ""The enthusiasm for people to move out of the private sector - and presumably take quite a considerable pay cut  - in order to work for the government on the next generation of AI is really tangible,"" he told the event. Among the ideas the Cabinet Office is working on is an ""AI red box"". The red box is the system by which ministers receive important papers. ""What it does is it can read documents that go into your red box, it can summarise them, it can highlight connections between papers, connections between previous papers,"" said Mr Burghart. ""And over time, as we fine-tune this model, it will become, I believe, the institutional memory of the department."" Staff in the Cabinet Office ""don't always stay that long"", he said, meaning the loss of people who remember ""things that happened three, four or five years ago"". ""But with an effective AI red box, that won't be a problem,"" he added. ""We will be able to retain the experiences of previous policies and previous successes."" The digital ministerial briefcase is being used by several ministers while it is being fine-tuned, and once ready will be offered to all colleagues, he said. The minister said he was hoping to get more cash from Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, in his Spring Budget, to develop AI systems to reduce fraud and error and improve productivity across government departments. Asked about the impact of AI on civil service jobs, he said: ""We may not need to employ thousands of people to do fraud detection in the future. ""I hope we don't.

A serving postmaster told the BBC the software is still unreliable, and causes money to disappear. Costs and delays are still dogging the Horizon project more than two decades after the contracts were first signed. The Post Office said it plans to start trialling a new system in branches this year. When Fujitsu won the contract to install computer terminals in over 17,000 Post Office branches around the UK, it called it ""the biggest non-military IT project in Europe"", designed to automate and simplify everything from selling stamps to paying pensions. Nearly 28 years later, it is still in use throughout the country, still plagued with difficulties, and the Post Office is struggling to replace it. It led to what has been called one of the most widespread miscarriages of justice in British history. Thousands of sub-postmasters who used Horizon to manage their businesses were held accountable for losses which were not their fault, with 983 receiving criminal convictions. Their plight received new public attention this year when ITV broadcast a drama series about their fight for justice. Horizon is still in use in UK Post Offices to this day. One postmaster, who runs two Post Offices in the South East of England and spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said the system is still unreliable. “You still get shortfalls. You can’t trust it. You can’t rely on it.” However, since the sub-postmasters won their court case in 2019, the Post Office is more likely to resolve significant disputes in the sub-postmaster’s favour, he said. A Post Office spokesperson said: ""As you would expect, we have made significant changes in the way we work with postmasters."" Horizon is currently housed in two Fujitsu-owned data centres in Belfast. In December 2022, the Post Office abandoned a plan to move it onto the vast network of data centres run by Amazon – a more up-to-date, flexible and robust system used by thousands of other online services known as ‘the cloud’. “Everything seems to be ‘in the cloud’ these days,” a Post Office announcement breezily noted in 2022. “You may well use the cloud to store photos and music on your devices, for example.” But later that year, the plan proved too difficult, and was abandoned. A Post Office spokesperson said: “The age of Horizon and the complexity involved meant that particular programme proved too technically challenging and costly. A decision was taken in November 2022 to discontinue this particular programme and resulted in a need to extend support services for our current data centres.” The cost of abandoning this plan was £31m, according to the Post Office’s latest accounts, published in December and first reported by The Stack news website. The Horizon contract was meant to expire in 2023 but the challenges of replacing it have been so great that it has been extended twice - for £42.5m in 2021, and again last year in two contracts worth £16.5m and £36.6m. These take the contract up to 1 April 2025, at a total cost of £95.6m. The Post Office justified the £16m contract extension because a “program to transfer the services to a new cloud provider created fundamental technical challenges that POL [Post Office Limited] could not economically and technically overcome.” The Post Office is still working on a replacement for Horizon, dubbed “New Branch IT”. The first installations were meant to happen last year, but it is behind schedule. A Post Office spokesperson said: “We are still working to come off Horizon. We’ve been testing basic mails transactions live on this new system in two pilot branches. Next, we are adding and testing more mails and back-office functionality. After evaluation, this will be the version that we plan to install in pilot branches later in 2024.” In 2022 the Post Office awarded Accenture a £27m contract to assist with moving their IT systems onto the cloud, and a separate contract to work on the user interface for the new system. The Post Office’s accounts also note that: “A further impairment review at the cash generating unit (“CGU”) level was performed during the year resulting in an additional impairment of capitalised software costs of £115 million.” In accounting terms, an impairment usually means that an asset which was once considered valuable has become less valuable, creating a loss for the business. The Post Office has not given the BBC more detail about how this loss had come about. Fujitsu and Accenture declined to comment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67950473,Wales junior doctor strike: many operations cancelled,"As junior doctors in Wales prepare for three strike days, one health board has postponed 80% of planned operations.",2024-01-11,"As junior doctors in Wales prepare for three strike days, one health board has postponed 80% of planned operations. British Medical Association (BMA) members called it a last resort to stop more leaving due to pay erosion. Dr Emily Sams said they were offered less than England and Scotland, meaning they ""don't need to go halfway around the world to Australia for better pay"". Health Minister Eluned Morgan reassured people that urgent and life-threatening care will continue to be provided. ""We are disappointed junior doctors have voted for industrial action, but we understand the strength of feeling among BMA members,"" said Ms Morgan. ""We would like to address their pay restoration ambitions, but the pay award offer we have made is at the limits of the finances available to us and reflects the position reached with the other unions. ""We continue to press the UK government to pass on the funding necessary to provide full and fair pay rises for public sector workers."" There are about 4,000 junior doctors working in Wales, making up 40% of the total medical workforce, mainly in hospitals. Nearly a quarter work for Cardiff and Vale health board, which provides a large proportion of tertiary care, meaning the impact on planned services will be significant. It is understood 75% of outpatient appointments and 80% of operations will not take place, to free up more senior staff to cover shifts around the clock. The BMA in Wales has planned a three-day strike from 07:00 GMT Monday until 07:00 Thursday in a dispute over pay. Its members have already been given a 5% rise by the Welsh government, which is below the 6% recommended by the independent remuneration body. In England, junior doctors have already been given 8.8%, but have rejected an additional offer worth 3% on average. In Scotland, an improved offer of 12.4% has been accepted, while in Northern Ireland a ballot is planned. Dr Sams is a general surgical trainee and a BMA Wales representative who graduated seven years ago and now works in south east Wales. She said of the colleagues she graduated alongside, 10 have since moved to Australia, many with the intention of staying a year or two, but have delayed plans to return while the pay disparity remains. ""Our doctors are getting paid the lowest rate of any junior doctor in the UK and the work they're doing is no less valuable,"" she said. ""We're at a point now in Wales where doctors don't need to go halfway around the world to Australia for better pay and better working conditions. ""Doctors will look across the border to England and Scotland."" She said for a long time Wales had struggled to attract trainees with contracts on offer across the border. ""And the pay now is much worse than it is in England and Scotland,"" she added. ""It means we're not attracting the best doctors to Wales. It means there will be more rota gaps. Our patients deserve more, we deserve to have the best doctors working here."" Health bosses will not know exactly how many staff will take part in the industrial action until the day, but significant disruption is expected. Donna Coleman, regional director for health and social care body Llais in west Wales said: ""People already know they're going to have sometimes very long waits for some kinds of surgery, so when they see this further disruption on top it's even more devastating for them. ""They just absolutely are at a loss with what to do and plan for their lives ahead. ""People will be distressed because of the uncertainty that there is in their life now and that's why it's really important that health boards make sure they communicate with people and give the extra support to keep them well while they're waiting."" Industrial action by junior doctors in England featured prominently during 2023, with six days of action at the start of this year, but this is the first time their colleagues in Wales will have taken to the picket lines. Junior doctor is the broad title given to anyone who has graduated from medical school but is yet to qualify as a consultant, and can include doctors with nine years or more experience. The health minister added: ""If you have a critical need to attend an emergency department you should still do so. ""We urge everyone to consider the best option for them, including using 111 online or phone service, or their local pharmacy.""","['Wales', 'Doctors', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/484D/production/_132190581_26454c0914625932e62b048d1042a44c3b0a501b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8988/production/_132280253_mediaitem132280252.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10526/production/_123745866_gettyimages-1237658203.jpg']",['Jenny Rees'],UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67945032,Four-mile trip between Powys towns to take 90 minutes,It is usually a four-mile journey between two nearby towns that takes about 10 minutes.,2024-01-11,"It is usually a four-mile journey between two nearby towns that takes about 10 minutes. However, getting from Pennal in Gwynedd to Machynlleth, Powys, is set to take an hour and a half because of a diversion of 46 miles (74km). This is in place during February for work on a new bridge across the River Dyfi aimed at reducing flooding. For Gwenan Roberts, from Pennal, the concern is not just getting to work - but to hospital when her baby arrives. She is seven months pregnant, and said: ""The worry is that the baby comes early. ""If he comes early then who knows what's going to happen? ""But also getting the kids to school on the other side of the river in Glantwymyn. I also work in Glantwymyn, so for me to get to work and for them, it's an extra hour and a half every morning, and every evening to come home. ""It won't be just a 10-minute drive any more."" Her fourth child is due in March, when the A493 is due to be reopened, but she is worried if things do not go to plan, she could face a longer journey to the maternity unit in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion. The Welsh government insisted work was vital to create a ""safer and more resilient"" route through the area, ensuring the road was no longer affected by flooding.""The work will take place throughout February and will involve drainage improvement works that will also protect a row of Grade II listed properties on the A493,"" a spokesperson said. It said officials would work with contractor Alun Griffiths to keep disruption to a minimum. While the 46-mile route is the recommended diversion, locals have been told that there is a shorter 29-mile (46km) journey along a B road. But this is little consolation, and Aled Rees, from Pennal Community Council, said he was worried about what would happen in an emergency. ""It could be a heart attack, it could be a stroke, it could be a car accident or an accident on the farm, where you need an ambulance to get to Aberystwyth quickly, and it's just not going to happen,"" he said. ""We accept that this work has got to be done, nobody's arguing about that. It's just the way it's done. ""We'd like it to be modified, and we'd like it to get done as soon as possible, possibly working 24 hours a day.""Dwyfor Meirionnydd Member of the Senedd (MS) Mabon ap Gwynfor raised the concerns of residents in the Welsh Parliament. He said: ""We have people living there who go to the GP surgery in Machynlleth, we have students going to school in Machynlleth and people who need to go to the hospital in Aberystwyth, let alone businesses who travel along that road. ""So it will have a very negative impact and I'm really concerned about it."" The new Dyfi bridge, which will open to traffic in February, has cost £46m and taken more than two years to build. It will sit above fields which are part of the Dyfi flood plain. After periods of heavy rain they are often under water, causing the closure of the old 19th Century Dyfi bridge. Even when the new bridge opens, disruption will not quite be at an end - sections of the nearby A493 and A487 will close for a month from 10 February for further work.","['Machynlleth', 'Welsh government', 'Wales', 'Pennal', 'Aberystwyth']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7600/production/_132280203_mediaitem132280202.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/27E0/production/_132280201_mediaitem132280200.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/84CD/production/_132279933_roadroutemap.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15C14/production/_132280198_mediaitem132280197.jpg']",['Craig Duggan'],UK,Politics

The by-election was triggered following Mr Bone's suspension from the House of Commons over bullying and sexual misconduct claims. Mr Bone, who was also suspended from the Conservative Party, has denied the allegations. Asked why he was out canvassing for his partner, Helen Harrison, he denied he was suspended from the party. Ms Harrison was selected as the Conservative candidate for Wellingborough on Sunday. North Northamptonshire Council confirmed the Wellingborough by-election would be held on 15 February. On Wednesday night, the BBC filmed Mr Bone as he canvassed residents in Rushden. Carrying what appeared to be party literature, Mr Bone was overheard asking a resident at the door, ""Are you normally Labour, Liberal, Conservative?"" Asked by the BBC whether he was out campaigning for Ms Harrison, Mr Bone said: ""Yes, I think that's rather obvious. ""We're out canvassing tonight. ""What gave you the idea I was a suspended party member? I'm not a suspended party member."" The Conservative Party told the BBC on 20 December that Mr Bone was suspended. A spokesman said on Thursday: ""During an investigation by the PSC, Mr Bone had his membership suspended. That investigation has since concluded, and Mr Bone is no longer an MP."" The former MP's suspension from Parliament had been recommended by the Independent Expert Panel (IEP), which found Mr Bone broke sexual misconduct rules. The watchdog also upheld five allegations of bullying. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-57085964,Covid inquiry: What is it investigating and how does it work?,Prime Minister Rishi Sunak robustly defended the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme he implemented as chancellor during the pandemic in his evidence to the Covid inquiry.,2024-01-11,"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak robustly defended the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme he implemented as chancellor during the pandemic in his evidence to the Covid inquiry. Earlier, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted he had underestimated the scale and the challenge of coronavirus. They were taking part in the second round of public hearings, which focused on the government's response. Public inquiries respond to ""public concern"" about events. Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair. Inquiries can demand evidence and compel witnesses to attend. No-one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions are published. The government is not obliged to accept any recommendations. The Covid inquiry, originally announced by Mr Johnson, covers decision-making during the pandemic by the UK government and in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. At the time, he said the government's response would be ""under the microscope"". The Covid inquiry began on 28 June 2022. It is chaired by former judge and crossbench peer Baroness Hallett, who previously led the inquests into the 7 July London bombings. The inquiry is split into different parts. Work in four areas has begun: Future strands will consider: There is no specific timescale for how long the inquiry will last but Lady Hallett does not expect the public hearings to run beyond summer 2026. Scotland is holding a separate inquiry. The prime minister apologised to ""all those who suffered... as a result of the actions that were taken"", but denied his Eat Out to Help Out Scheme had increased Covid infections and deaths. He also rejected earlier evidence from the government's chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, and former chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance that they were not consulted about the policy. The former prime minister gave evidence across two days. The inquiry had already heard from government officials and advisers, academic experts and representatives of bereaved families, many of whom were extremely critical of how Mr Johnson made decisions. He began by apologising for the ""pain and the loss and the suffering"" experienced during the pandemic. His comments were interrupted by protesters, who were ordered to leave the room. Some members of bereaved families held up signs reading: ""The dead can't hear your apologies."" Mr Johnson admitted mistakes were made, and that ""there were unquestionably things we should have done differently"". He said he took ""personal responsibility for all decisions made"", but insisted that ministers had done their ""level best"" in difficult circumstances. Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who previously told the inquiry the UK's pandemic strategy had been completely wrong - denied he lied to colleagues during his period in office. But he admitted the UK should have locked down much sooner and criticised the ""toxic culture"" in government, for which he blamed Mr Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings. Cabinet minister Michael Gove also apologised to ""victims and families who endured so much loss"", but denied Mr Johnson could not take decisions. Sir Chris, his former deputy Prof Sir Jonathan Van-Tam and Sir Patrick revealed significant tensions between their advice to government and its political priorities, such as over Eat Out to Help Out. Sir Jonathan revealed he and his family had received death threats, while Sir Patrick said he had also considered resigning over abuse. Former deputy cabinet secretary Helen MacNamara told the inquiry that she struggled ""to pick one day"" when Covid rules were properly followed inside a ""macho"" and ""toxic"" No 10. In his evidence, Mr Cummings described a ""dysfunctional"" government with no plans to lock down the country or shield the vulnerable. The inquiry heard scathing text messages which he sent, many of which contained offensive descriptions of ministers and officials. He said he regretted the disastrous handling of his infamous trip to Barnard Castle during the first lockdown, but denied his actions had damaged public trust. Further public hearings on the question of government decision-making will be held in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in January, February and April 2024 respectively. The first public hearings, linked to the UK's resilience and preparedness, took evidence from 69 independent experts and former and current government officials and ministers. These included former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock, former prime minister David Cameron and former first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon. Sir Chris, his predecessor Prof Dame Sally Davies, and Sir Patrick also gave evidence during the first hearings. Baroness Hallett said she intends to publish the report for the first area of work ""as soon as possible"" - hopefully by early summer 2024. A report based on the second round of hearings is also due in 2024. Public hearings for the third area of examination - the impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems across the UK - are expected to run for 10 weeks from autumn 2024. But the inquiry will not take evidence in summer 2024 about the development of vaccines and other drugs, as planned. Witness hearings will be postponed, probably until after the next general election. Organisations needed more time to prepare for a separate investigation into the impact of Covid on the NHS, Lady Hallett said. Anyone can share their experience through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which criticised the government's handling of the pandemic - urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard. Public hearings are streamed on the BBC News website and the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts are published on the inquiry website. Members of the public can also apply to attend in person.","['Matthew Hancock', 'Boris Johnson', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Coronavirus public inquiry', 'Coronavirus', 'Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1098A/production/_131587976_gettyimages-1232132231.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14E1/production/_130054350_thumbnail_line_uk_deaths-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0A7F/production/_130078620_6f8a20cd-0e8d-40ea-b46f-2c137d1b2147.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4D74/production/_131982891_capture.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10900/production/_131804876_trio2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0904/production/_131580320_5a1fcad31834e2e73c4f814b41eff81768fe5069.jpg']",['Jennifer Clarke'],UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-67759402,Peter Bone: How Wellingborough ended up with a by-election,"Following a recall petition triggered by MP Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons,",2024-01-11,"Following a recall petition triggered by MP Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons, a by-election will be held in Wellingborough. How did the Northamptonshire constituency end up without an MP and having to go to the polls? The 71-year-old has been active in Conservative politics since the 1970s, but did not make it to Parliament until 2005, when he won the Wellingborough seat. In 2019, he had a majority of 18,540 in the constituency. A prominent Brexit-supporter, he campaigned with Nigel Farage in the 2016 referendum. Also a leading voice on the right of the Tory party, he briefly served as deputy Commons leader under Boris Johnson. He was known for jokey references in Parliament to his wife Jenny (""Mrs Bone"") - but the couple split in 2016 and he is reportedly in a new relationship. Mr Bone made frequent media appearances and notable interjections in the Commons, such as raising the issue of flies in Rushden and breaking protocol by wearing a hat to promote a local charity. Mr Bone was suspended for six weeks following an inquiry into his behaviour earlier this year. An investigation by Parliament's behaviour watchdog, the Independent Expert Panel, found Mr Bone broke sexual misconduct rules by indecently exposing himself to a staff member during an overseas trip. It also upheld five allegations of bullying, including verbally belittling, physically striking and throwing things at the staff member. The alleged victim told the BBC ""physical, emotional and psychological abuse"" by the MP left him a ""broken shell of the young man I once was"". Mr Bone has denied the allegations and returned to the Commons - after his suspension - to vote on the Rwanda bill. A recall petition lets voters remove an MP between general elections. It is triggered if an MP is convicted of a crime or suspended from the Commons for more than 10 days. If 10% of voters in the constituency sign the petition, the seat becomes vacant. This petition was open for six weeks from 8 November to 19 December and was backed by 10,505 people - which equates to 13.2% of the electorate. It means a by-election is due to be held this year. It is not known whether Mr Bone will stand but if he does it will be as an independent. The Conservative Party has selected Helen Harrison as its candidate, Gen Kitchen will be standing for the Labour Party and Ana Savage Gunn will represent the Lib Democrats. Will Morris is the Green Party candidate for Wellingborough and Reform UK has selected Ben Habib for the by-election. Britain First has also indicated it will contest the by-election. The by-election will be held on 15 February following and North Northamptonshire Council (NNC) said voters in the constituency will start to receive their poll cards on 19 January. The poll cards will include information on how to arrange a postal or proxy vote for those who cannot make it to their polling station on the day. Anyone who is eligible to vote but is not registered has until 30 January to register following the process on the NNC website. Following a law change last year, people who vote in person on 15 February will have to remember to bring a form of photo ID with them.

Britain First has indicated it will also contest the by-election. Mr Bone could stand again, but it would be as an independent, as the Conservatives have suspended him. Candidates are listed in alphabetical order by surname. The Liberal Democrat candidate was born in Northamptonshire and grew up in the county. She joined Northamptonshire Police in 1985 and rose to the rank of inspector, serving across the county - including in Wellingborough - and she supervised the tactical firearms team. Ms Savage Gunn helped run security for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and later became a law enforcement consultant in the US, before her return to the UK and Northamptonshire. When Covid-19 broke out she retrained as a health care assistant and worked in her mother's care home, before becoming a Covid clinic co-ordinator in the county. She continues to work at the care home, and is a trustee of Northamptonshire Carers, in Wellingborough. Note: Gunn is used as the candidate's primary surname, hence she appears at the top of the alphabetical list. The candidate for Reform UK is the party's co-deputy leader and a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Brexit Party. Reform UK, previously the Brexit Party, was co-founded by Nigel Farage in 2018. Mr Habib is a property developer and fund manager, and previously a donor to the Conservatives. The 58-year-old said: ""I intend to give the Wellingborough by-election the best swing of my bat and if I am elected I will stand in the Commons and hold this wretched government to account to the very best of my ability."" Ms Harrison represents the Oundle ward on North Northamptonshire Council and is executive member for Adults, Health and Wellbeing on the authority. She also previously ran for Parliament in 2017 in the Derbyshire constituency of Bolsover. Ms Harrison said: ""I am delighted to have been selected as the candidate for Wellingborough. ""As the local candidate, I am best suited to deliver for the people of Wellingborough, having already done so on a local authority level."" She is also the partner of Mr Bone, who was first elected to the seat in 2005. Labour's candidate grew up in Northamptonshire and went to John Hellins Primary School in Towcester, and Kingsbrook secondary school - now Elizabeth Woodville School - in Roade. She has worked in the charity sector her whole career. In 2019, she stood as prospective parliamentary candidate for Labour in the South Northamptonshire constituency - losing to the Conservatives' Andrea Leadsom. After her selection in November, the Ms Kitchen said: ""Residents here are already telling me that they're fed up with the state of the town centre, anti-social behaviour blighting our high streets and the 8am scramble for a GP appointment. ""Labour has a plan to tackle these issues that impact so many here, but I will start by giving Wellingborough a voice in Westminster and working hard to restore pride in our town and villages."" Mr Morris, lives in Bozeat in the south of the constituency, having previously lived in Wellingborough, and works as an insurance underwriter. The 55-year-old has been a member of the Green Party for five years and has stood as the party's candidate for North Northamptonshire Council in Irchester and Rushden South. He has also served on Bozeat Parish Council for three years. Mr Morris said: ""What Wellingborough needs is a representative who knows and cares about local issues, rather than someone concerned with furthering their personal agenda in the national political arena.

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67938079,Pornography review to canvass public's view on issue,"The public, adult performers and law enforcement are being invited to",2024-01-11,"The public, adult performers and law enforcement are being invited to answer a questionnaire on the impact of pornography. It will be used in a review of the industry that will make recommendations to government. Questions will include the effect of porn on relationships, mental health and attitudes towards women and girls. But a trade association for the adult industry has said it seemed a ""pretext for greater censorship"". The review will also look at how AI and virtual reality are changing how pornography is made and consumed. There is concern about the ability of AI to generate child abuse images, and non-consensual pornographic images. In December the government announced that Conservative peer Baroness Bertin, who used to work at 10 Downing Street, would lead an ""independent"" pornography review. The study would examine abuse, exploitation and trafficking in the pornography industry, its impact on viewers, and ways to bolster law enforcement to help tackle illegal pornographic content. Measures to stop children accessing pornography online by requiring services to establish the age of their users, including through age verification and age estimation tools, are already included in the new Online Safety Act. But Baroness Bertin said the review would help ""future proof the law"" as technology evolved. ""Extreme pornography can have a damaging impact - we owe it to our children and indeed to the whole of society to put the guard rails back in place,"" she said. The Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult industry, said it hoped the government was ""honest in its invitation to involve the adult industry in this discussion"". ""Despite the sometimes fevered headlines and political speeches, we are a legal, ethical industry with families ourselves, one that prioritises consent and safety, and wants to keep minors from accessing our content as much as others do,"" a spokesperson said. The organisation told the BBC it was ""wary"" of the review which it said ""frames sexual expression as a threat and a societal harm"". It said while the review seemed a pretext for censorship, it would ""proceed in good faith and help work to dispel myths and find workable solutions"". Myles Jackman an obscenity lawyer, academic, and activist said it was disappointing that ""the review is framed in such presumptive and negative terms: rather than focusing on children's sexual relationship educational needs"". The questionnaire follows the release of figures showing a rise in sexual offenses committed by children, which Police blamed on a combination of mobile phone ownership and the availability of hardcore pornography. Rick Muir from the Police Foundation think tank welcomed the review: ""Anything that can be done to tackle harmful sexual behaviours is positive and from a policing point of view should in the long term help to reduce crime."" But Professor Sonia Livingstone of the LSE queried the lack of emphasis on academic research and said the review should look at the evidence researchers had already collated: ""I hope they read it"", she told the BBC. She added that the Online Safety Act ""should be a game changer in keeping children safe online in the UK. It's not clear what is being proposed here that's new"". It would also be important to look at business models that lead pornography firms to use algorithms that pushed ever more extreme content, including to those who may be particularly vulnerable, Prof Livingstone argued. The review is expected to report back later in 2024.",['Pornography'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/111F9/production/_132273107_gettyimages-1435693964.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D2FA/production/_132101045_untitled-1-2.jpg']",['Chris Vallance'],UK,Politics

Jobs are going on teams working on health tracker Fitbit, the voice-controlled Google Assistant and hardware such as augmented reality. The exact number of job losses is unclear, although Google confirmed to the Verge it had closed ""a few hundred"" roles across several of its teams. Google said it was ""responsibly investing"" in its biggest priorities. But in a post on X, formerly Twitter, the Alphabet Workers Union said the job cuts were not necessary, and it would fight them. ""Our members and teammates work hard every day to build great products for our users, and the company cannot continue to fire our coworkers while making billions every quarter,"" it wrote. However, Google has defended the latest round of redundancies. ""Throughout the second half of 2023, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, and to align their resources to their biggest product priorities,"" the tech giant told the BBC in a statement. ""Some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally. We're continuing to support any impacted employees as they look for new roles here at Google and beyond."" The firm made $76.3bn (£59.9bn) in revenue in the third quarter of 2023, according to its most recent figures, with a net income of $19.7bn. Google purchased Fitbit for $2.1bn in 2019 at a time when many tech businesses were expanding into other areas. But now it has slashed jobs in the team - with Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman among those leaving the firm, according to multiple reports. Other major job cuts have come in the team working on Google Assistant, a voice-controlled technology similar to Amazon's Alexa. These job losses are again understood to be measured in the hundreds. It comes a few months after Google announced in a blog post that its artificial intelligence tool Bard would be powering future forms of Assistant.","['Companies', 'Alphabet', 'Wearable technology', 'Fitness trackers', 'Employment', 'Google']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/111B3/production/_132276007_mediaitem132276006.jpg'],['Tom Gerken'],Tech,Tech
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67944537,"Our fingerprints may not be unique, claims AI",There is a belief that each fingerprint on one person's hand is completely unique but that is now being challenged by research from Columbia University.,2024-01-11,"There is a belief that each fingerprint on one person's hand is completely unique but that is now being challenged by research from Columbia University. A team at the US university trained an AI tool to examine 60,000 fingerprints to see if it could work out which ones belonged to the same individual. The researchers claim the technology could identify, with 75-90% accuracy, whether prints from different fingers came from one person. But they are not sure how it works. ""We don't know for sure how the AI does it,"" admitted Prof Hod Lipson, a roboticist at Columbia University who supervised the study. The researchers think the AI tool was analysing the fingerprints in a different way to traditional methods - focusing on the orientation of the ridges in the centre of a finger rather than the way in which the individual ridges end and fork which is known as minutiae. ""It is clear that it isn't using traditional markers that forensics have been using for decades,"" said Prof Lipson. ""It seems like it is using something like the curvature and the angle of the swirls in the centre."" Prof Lipson said both he and Gabe Guo,  an undergraduate student, were both surprised by the outcome. ""We were very sceptical... we had to check and double check,"" he said. That may not be news to others in the field. Graham Williams, professor of forensic science at Hull University, said the idea of unique fingerprints had never been set in stone. ""We don't actually know that fingerprints are unique,"" he said. ""All we can say is that as far as we are aware, no two people have yet to demonstrate the same fingerprints."" The results of Columbia University's study could have the potential to impact both biometrics - using one particular finger to unlock a device or provide identification - and forensic science. If, for example, an unidentified thumb print is found at crime scene A, and an unidentified index finger print at crime scene B, the two could not currently be forensically connected to the same person - but the AI tool could be able to identify this. The Columbia University team, none of whom have forensic backgrounds, admitted that more research was needed. AI tools are typically trained on vast amounts of data and many more fingerprints would be required to develop this technology further. Additionally, all the fingerprints used to develop the model were complete prints and of good quality, whereas often in the real world partial or poor prints are more likely to be found. ""Our tool is not good enough for deciding evidence in court cases but it is good for generating leads in forensics investigations,"" claimed Mr Guo. But Dr Sarah Fieldhouse, associate professor of forensic science at Staffordshire University, said she did not think the study would have ""significant impact"" on criminal casework at this stage. She said there were questions around whether the markers the AI tool was focusing on remained the same depending on how the skin twisted as it came into contact with the print surface, and also whether they remained the same over the course of a lifetime, like traditional markers do. But this could be tricky to answer as the researchers are uncertain about exactly what the AI is doing, as is the case with many AI-driven tools. The Columbia University study has been peer-reviewed and will be published in the journal Science Advances on Friday. But a pair of twins in Cheshire might be ahead of everyone. Their grandmother Carol told the BBC her two grandchildren can open each other's iPhones using their own fingers. ""They showed me on Christmas day,"" she said. ""We were told they were identical when they were born but I can tell the difference between them as they've got older."" She claimed that her grandchildren can also bypass the handsets' facial recognition feature. Fingerprints are formed before birth. Research published last year suggested the genetic process behind them may be similar to the way animals like zebras and leopards get their markings: a theory first proposed by codebreaker Alan Turing in the 1950s.","['Forensic science', 'Artificial intelligence']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12C43/production/_132276867_gettyimages-1394982614.jpg'],['Zoe Kleinman'],Tech,Tech

It has been struck by US actors' union Sag-Aftra and AI firm Replica Studios. The union says it guarantees ""fully informed consent and fair compensation"" for its members. But many voice artists, who have long been concerned AI will replace them, have reacted with fury with one calling the deal ""garbage."" In an email to members, seen by the BBC, Sag-Aftra said the deal was negotiated by a committee which included ""actors with significant and diverse experience performing in games"". ""The contract was specifically tailored to the needs of voice actors, ensuring informed consent and proper compensation terms that are unique to this set of performers,"" it said. It comes after Sag-Aftra led a months-long strike in 2023 to fight for protections from film and television studios using AI. Many voice actors have suggested this new deal is at odds with the purpose of that industrial action, with Fallout and Mortal Kombat voice actor Sunil Malhotra saying he ""sacrificed to strike half of last year to keep my profession alive, not shop around my AI replica"". In a blog covering the announcement, Sag-Aftra said the deal was ""approved by affected members of the union's voiceover performer community"". ""Recent developments in AI technology have underscored the importance of protecting the rights of voice talent, particularly as game studios explore more efficient ways to create their games,"" said the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. ""With this agreement, we have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances."" But Steve Blum, a voice actor once credited by Guinness for being the most prolific in video games, said ""nobody"" he knew of had approved the deal. According to Sag-Aftra, the agreement lays out terms and conditions for AI-generated voices in video games, which can be licensed by Replica Studios both in gaming and other forms of media. It requires the AI firm to get consent from actors before it uses voices based on their likeness, and also gives voice actors the ability to deny their voice being used in perpetuity without their consent. But it has been met with consternation from the performers themselves, with World of Warcraft voice actor Andrew Russell calling it ""garbage"", while Shelby Young, who will provide the voice of Yuko in the upcoming Persona 3: Reload, said she was ""really disappointed"" in the union. Voice actors outside of gaming have also criticised the agreement, with Joshua Seth, known for voicing Tai in animated series Digimon, calling it a ""big mistake"", while audiobook narrator Paige Reisenfeld said she was ""ashamed"" that her union payments went towards it. And Veronica Taylor, who provided the voice for Ash in Pokemon, asked how the deal was made without being put to a vote. But Sag-Aftra president Fran Drescher said the deal was ""a great example of AI being done right"". Meanwhile, Replica Studios CEO Shreya Nivas said the deal was an ""ethical approach"" to AI. ""We are excited by the new opportunities this opens up for world-leading AAA studios who can now access the benefits of Replica's AI voice technology while knowing that talent is recognized and compensated fairly for the use of their likeness,"" he said.","['Gaming', 'Artificial intelligence']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1CD9/production/_132258370_mediaitem132258369.jpg'],['Tom Gerken'],Tech,Tech
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67922588,Animators say ‘AI isn't going to get you an Oscar’,"Comic book writer David Crownson is fearful that artificial intelligence (AI) is ""going to put a lot of people out of work"" in his industry.",2024-01-11,"Comic book writer David Crownson is fearful that artificial intelligence (AI) is ""going to put a lot of people out of work"" in his industry. ""With studios and big-name publishers looking for ways to save money and cut corners, they will no doubt use AI technology,"" he says. As the growth of AI surged to prominence last year, writers and illustrators of comic books and animations continue to be particularly concerned about its potential impact on them. After all, AI can produce digital images in seconds, images that wouldn't look out of place in a graphic novel. At least to those of us with untrained eyes. And AI can write stories too. With a small but fast-growing number of AI-made comics and animated TV programmes already released commercially, the technology could transform the industry. There is a lot of money involved - the global comic book market is worth an estimated $15.5bn (£12.2bn) a year, while the animated industry is 25 times bigger, at $411bn. New Jersey-based Mr Crownson is also the boss of publisher Kingwood Comics, which focuses on both promoting black writers, and releasing comic books with black characters. ""Now I have to compete with an AI user who can produce faster content,"" he says. ""Also, a white person could tell his AI to create an action adventure comic with black characters."" Mr Crownson points to a similar development that has already happened in the clothing industry, where jeans giant Levi admitted last year to using AI to artificially create photos of black models. He adds that he is fearful that it may lead to a lot of unemployed comic book writers who come from an ethnic minority background. ""AI is dangerous to the employment of black artists,"" he says. AI can never replicate the quality of humans when it comes to storytelling, argues Shawnee Gibbs. Working with her twin Shawnelle, the Los Angeles-based sisters have written graphic novels for Marvel Comics and Harper Collins, and animations for Cartoon Network and Dreamworks Animation. ""It is important for us to advocate for human storytellers now, so that there is an industry left for future creators later,"" says Shawnee. ""This is an incredibly unique medium [comics and animation] that gets its DNA from the collaboration of writers and artists. I can't imagine that kind of synergy when you generate stories from AI."" However, her sister Shawnelle says she is ""sure AI will change the industry in ways we can't even fathom at the moment"". She wants to see ""legislation emerge that protects human creators as AI technology evolves"". At present there is little definite in this area, but Californian governor Gavin Newsom is now investigating the issue. Meanwhile, US authorities ruled last year that the images in an AI-created comic book could not be copyrighted. The Gibbs sisters are members of Women In Comics Collective International, an organisation that supports female comic book writers and illustrators. It was established in 2012 by US comic book writer Regine Sawyer. ""We discuss the use of AI in our panel discussions, and will continue to do so,"" says Ms Sawyer. ""Our members are very concerned. We want to be very clear about our stance on how AI is used in the comic book industry."" Their stance is that AI is a great tool for research, but not as a creator of material. ""When it's used to replace creators, therein lies the problem,"" she adds. Dave Jesteadt, is president of GKids, a US company that produces and distributes animated films. He agrees that the use of AI should be limited to an assistant role, but that he has yet to see this done successfully. ""To the extent that AI can help individual creators as a tool, I look forward to seeing positive examples in the years to come."" Rob Edwards is a screenwriter of animated movies and writer of graphic novels. His film work includes co-writing the script for the Oscars-nominated 2009 film The Princess And The Frog. He fears that AI will deprive both comic books and animations of their inventiveness. ""A world of writers using AI is a world of derivative, recycled, impersonal ideas,"" he says. ""Right now, there's a kid out there drawing the next weird but innovative comic book that could inspire millions. My concern is that AI will talk that kid out of it before anybody sees it. ""If you think the animated movies you watch are predictable now, just wait until computers are writing them."" Read additional stories on artificial intelligence While established players in both the comic book and animation sectors are understandably concerned about AI, there has been a big growth in AI-powered comic book and animation creation apps aimed at the home user. For animation these include Animaker AI, Blender, Cascader and Deepmotion. While for comic book creation, apps include Comics Maker, AI Comic Factory and Neural Canvas. They make promises such as allowing users to create ""jaw-dropping comics"", or that ""any person can now create a studio quality animated video in an instant"". One person who has created comic books whose images were all drawn by AI is New York-based artist Steve Coulson, and his five-part The Bestiary Chronicles. He says that using AI to create individual images ""can be a pretty simple exercise"". However, he says that when you want to tell a story over multiple images, it ""is a tougher nut to crack"", as you have to ""coax the system to produce consistent characters, settings, stylings, etc, in order to tell a cohesive story"". Yet he adds that this will ""no doubt"" become easier as AI-powered systems are enhanced. Despite the growing popularity of all these apps, Jonathan Kendrick, co-founder and chairman of global streaming service Rokit Flix, says that AI is not yet good enough to be a threat to professional comic book creators and animators. ""AI cannot create an image the way a human mind can,"" he says. ""It's like having a bad writer help you - sure it will get an outline done, but if you need something with emotional weight, an AI isn't going to get you an Oscar. ""AI can never surprise us in the way we want our stories and art to be portrayed. Because of this, AI is simply a tool to be used by humans, not to replace them. Otherwise, we sacrifice the originality and creativity that consumers know and love.""

The exotic-looking waxwings have been spotted at Priors Hall Park in Corby, Northamptonshire. The birds only come to the UK when food is lacking in their native forests in Russia and northern Europe. Wildlife photographer Tom Hanahoe sped to the county to capture them on camera and described them as ""truly beautiful"". On its website, the British Trust for Ornithology said ""waxwings come to the UK in search of berries when crops run low closer to their breeding grounds in Fennoscandia and western Russia"". ""As such [they] can turn up at any time during the winter and in varying numbers."" Mr Hanahoe, from Bedfordshire, said he heard from other twitchers that waxwings had been spotted in Stevenage in Hertfordshire, so he went there but missed them by about 15 minutes. Then he was told about sightings in Corby, so travelled there to join about 20 others who had also heard the news. On his arrival, there were four birds. ""They tend to come in, particularly to Scotland, and then spread down the east coast,"" Mr Hanahoe said. ""They tend not to move too far inland, and I suspect Corby might be toward the limit of their range. ""They don't come every year - sometimes if there's a really good harvest in the north, in Europe and Russia, they won't come. ""The last time we had goodly numbers... was round about 2017, so it's great to see them now."" He said the birds were usually seen in town centres and supermarket car parks where they could find their favourite berries - from rowan trees. Mr Hanahoe said waxwings ""look fantastic - they really do"". ""They're a sort of velvety, browny, peachy, reddy colour, but then on the bottom of the tail they have a bright yellow strip, then up the sides of the wings are yellow flashes."" He said the red tips of the wings gave the birds their name, ""because the red is very much like the colour of the wax used in ancient times to seal letters"". ""They also have a crest on their head, so they look truly beautiful. It's really smashing to see."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

In 2020, Britain's first known 5th Century mosaic was uncovered at Chedworth Roman Villa in Cheltenham. New soil samples taken from underneath the mosaic revealed the tiles could not have been laid before 400AD. Experts say this provides further evidence that sophisticated life at the manor had continued for decades after the country had entered the Dark Ages. Following the economic crash at the end of the 4th Century, it was widely believed that all towns and villas were largely abandoned, falling into decay within a few years, National Trust archaeologists working at Chedworth said. As such the discovery of the mosaic, dated to around 400AD, has stirred much debate among historians. Alongside radiocarbon dating tests and pottery found on the site, archaeologists confirmed the findings using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to test when the soil particles beneath the tiles were last exposed to sunlight. ""We've used OSL to date several significant archaeological sites in the National Trust, and the additional confirmation provided by both this and our new radiocarbon dates adds weight to our conclusion that this is indeed a 5th Century mosaic,"" National Trust archaeologist Martin Papworth said. ''We're now continuing our research. Evidence is being gathered from other West Country villa archives to track down additional dating evidence. ""This will put our 5th Century Chedworth dates in context so we can further understand what life would've been like during this period, not only at Chedworth, but within the community of villas and towns that surround it."" The archaeologists working at Chedworth have been revisiting their find from 2020 for a new episode of 'Digging for Britain' airing on 11 January and available on iPlayer. Viewers will be able to follow along with the investigation as further tests are conducted. The ornate mosaic has now been re-buried following the excavation to protect it from weather damage.

The secretive mammal was spotted fishing in the waterway, which runs through Holywells Park in Ipswich. Park keeper Matthew Garnham filmed the otter and shared it with Suffolk Wildlife Trust (SWT). Otters have been sighted in Ipswich in the past, along the River Orwell and in the Port of Ipswich, SWT said. ""However the presence of an otter in Holywells Park demonstrates how wildlife is adapting to changing landscapes, and habitat loss - and the importance of urban greens spaces as habitat for wildlife,"" said the trust. The wildlife charity explained that otters were elusive animals, and one of the UK's top predators, feeding mainly on fish - particularly eels and salmonids - water birds, amphibians and crustaceans. ""Otters are a rare species and require clean rivers with an abundant source of food and plenty of vegetation to hide their secluded burrows - known as 'holts',"" a SWT spokesman said. Mr Garnham said the park wanted to ensure the otter was undisturbed by the public. ""I was surprised to hear one had make it into the park,"" he said. ""I'm wondering how many otters we've got. Some travel in family groups, normally a sow with her pup's. ""It's very comfortable in the park feeding on the fish."" Christine Luxton, SWT's chief executive officer, said the recent floods could explain why the otter had decided to travel further inland. ""Rivers are essentially wildlife highways and an important part of habitat connectivity,"" she said.

The skeleton of a man was discovered with a nail through his heel in Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire, in 2017. Cambridge University bone specialist Corinne Duhig said it was an ""almost unique"" find at what was a previously unknown Roman settlement. The reconstruction of the man's face was revealed in a BBC Four programme, which explored details of his life. Ms Duhig said: ""This man had such a particularly awful end that it feels as though by seeing his face you can give more respect to him."" Prior to the Fenstanton discovery, the only other Roman crucified remains discovered had been in Israel, according to Ms Duhig, an osteologist from the university's Wolfson College. She said: ""The lucky combination of good preservation and the nail being left in the bone has allowed me to examine this almost unique example when so many thousands have been lost."" Other injuries were found, suggesting the man had suffered before he died, and his legs had signs of infection or inflammation caused by either a systemic disorder or by being bound or shackled. Analysis of the remains revealed he spent his whole life in the Cambridgeshire area, and most likely had brown hair and eyes. It also suggested he was a manual worker, possibly working on processing bone marrow for candles or soaps from the many animal bones found on the site. Crucifixion was a particularly brutal death, most famously used for Jesus Christ, but also in use for centuries before and after. Initially it was used for traitors and slaves, but in the 3rd Century, with the extension of Roman citizenship, its use was expanded. Ms Duhig said: ""He was tortured yet given over to his population to have an absolutely normal burial."" The facial reconstruction was undertaken by Prof Joe Mullins of George Mason University, Virginia, USA, who said it was ""by the far the most interesting skull I've worked on in my career"". The settlement was discovered by Bedford-based Albion Archaeology, which began its excavation in 2017 ahead of a planned housing development. Archaeologists found five 3rd and 4th Century cemeteries where 40 adults and five children were buried, some from the same families. The Cambridgeshire Crucifixion can be watched on BBC iPlayer.

In the biggest study of its kind, with 13,000 cancer patients in England, combining clinical data and DNA evidence meant care could be tailored. Based on the results, some were given different drugs or avoided ones likely to cause them side effects. Most brain tumours had genetics that affected treatment decisions. In the study, published in Nature Medicine, more than nine out of every 10 brain tumours and most bowel and lung cancers exhibited genetic changes that could guide decisions about surgery or specific treatments. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses someone's entire genetic code - all 3.2 billion letters that make up their DNA. Cancer patients have: The first can show genetic variations that may make them more susceptible to cancer - the BRCA1 mutation can increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, for example. The second can show which genes are helping to spread their cancer and whether they may be more likely to suffer adverse side effects from some drugs. In more than 10% of sarcomas - solid cancers in the bone and muscle - the researchers found genetic changes that revealed different sub-types of the cancer, which, in turn, helped doctors choose the correct treatment. They also found more than 10% of ovarian cancers were probably inherited, offering insights into clinical care and potential testing of family members. The study, led by Genomics England, NHS England, Queen Mary University of London, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Westminster and completed in 2018, analysed data covering over 30 types of solid tumours. It was ""an important milestone in genomic medicine"", Dr Nirupa Murugaesu said. ""We are starting to realise the promise of precision oncology that was envisioned 10 years ago, when the 100,000 Genomes Project was launched,"" she said. ""We are showing how cancer genomics can be incorporated into mainstream cancer care across a national health system - and the benefits that can bring patients. ""By collecting long-term clinical data alongside genomic data, the study has created a first-of-its-kind resource for clinicians to better predict outcomes and tailor treatments, which will allow them to inform, prepare, and manage the expectations of patients more effectively."" The results had been fed back to clinical teams, Dr Murugaesu said. And at least one trust in the East Midlands had taken action in about one in every four of the cases, mostly putting patients into clinical trials or ensuring they avoided medicines for which they had an increased risk of side effects. Genomics England scientific director for cancer Dr Alona Sosinsky said: ""The 100,000 Genomes Project paved the way for delivering whole-genome sequencing in cancer.

A UK regulator found the poster - featuring the singer just wearing a denim shirt - was likely to cause serious offence by objectifying women. Writing on Instagram, she suggested the ban - which came after a campaign starring actor Jeremy Allen White went viral - showed ""double standards"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said its ruling was clear. In the advert, FKA was wearing a denim shirt drawn halfway around her body, showing the side of her buttocks and half of one breast. Above her, text read: ""Calvins or nothing"". The ASA found the image ""placed viewers' focus on the model's body rather than on the clothing being advertised"". By focusing on her ""physical features"", it continued, it felt the advert had ""presented her as a stereotypical sexual object"". In her response, FKA twigs wrote: ""I do not see the 'stereotypical sexual object' that they have labelled me. ""I see a beautiful strong woman of colour whose incredible body has overcome more pain than you can imagine."" She went on to apparently reference the Calvin Klein campaign featuring Jeremy Allen White that grabbed headlines last week, with the actor later being asked about it at the Golden Globes. In her post, FKA Twigs said: ""In light of reviewing other campaigns past and current of this nature, I can't help but feel there are some double standards here. And despite the ban, she said she was ""proud"" of the photos, thanking Calvin Klein and fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggot. The ASA told BBC Newsbeat it had received three complaints about adverts featuring Jeremy Allen White - one relating to a magazine and two about a TV version. It said it was currently reviewing, but not yet investigating, claims that the ads ""sexually objectify the model"". The regulator can launch a full investigation after just a single complaint if it believes an advert breaks its rules, but says about 80% of cases do not progress to this stage. Defending its advert, Calvin Klein said it had been similar to those it had been releasing in the UK for many years. In response to FKA's post, an ASA spokesperson said: ""Our published ruling sets out why, on this occasion, the ad broke the rules by irresponsibly objectifying a woman and being targeted inappropriately.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67943913,"Mean Girls: New film struggles with 'muzzled' humour and 'awkward' music, critics say","The new Mean Girls movie has divided critics, with some saying jokes have lost their edge due to script updates.",2024-01-11,"The new Mean Girls movie has divided critics, with some saying jokes have lost their edge due to script updates. The new film is an adaptation of the successful stage musical, which was itself based on the hit 2004 film. Entertainment Weekly said ""life with the Plastics pretty darn fantastic"", but the Hollywood Reporter described the film as a ""tuneless mess"". Many of the original movie's jokes and characters have been updated because of changes in attitudes and teen culture. ""It's come to no-one's surprise that jokes have changed,"" screenwriter Tina Fey told the New York Times recently. ""You don't poke in the way that you used to poke. ""Even if your intention was always the same, it's just not how you do it any more, which is fine. I very much believe that you can find new ways to do jokes with less accidental shrapnel sideways."" Referring to the film's queen of mean Regina George, Fey added: ""I know that even Regina would know what wouldn't fly. She's going to find a way to inflict pain on people, but she's not going to get herself in trouble."" Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker gave the film a positive B score, praising the changes to the script in an era of ""more inclusivity and acceptance"" but noting one side effect being that the story has lost some of its potency. ""Though the core story remains the same, Fey wisely updates the script for a new generation of teens,"" she wrote. ""Social changes, particularly the absolute chokehold that social media has on pop culture and the lives of teenagers, are integrated into the plot seamlessly."" But, she added: ""Part of the genius of the original Mean Girls was how it captured the downright viciousness of teenage girls, and some of that predatory bite has been muzzled here."" The original Mean Girls starred Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams, and was later adapted into a stage musical. The musical is the basis for the new film and means, unlike the earlier screen version, the 2024 Mean Girls movie features songs - something that was not made clear in the trailer. ""All the effervescence and fun have been drained out of the material in this laboured reincarnation, a movie musical made by people who appear to have zero understanding of movie-musical vernacular,"" wrote The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney. ""The songs seldom spring organically from the story and more often feel so awkwardly shoehorned in that you come to dread them."" He added: ""On stage, Regina strutted into every scene like a Bond vixen, bathed in a pink glow that made both her beauty and her cruelty seem almost otherworldly. Here, she's nasty but seldom funny, perhaps reflecting a shift in the culture that now makes it harder to milk comedy out of bullying snark."" The new adaptation of Mean Girls stars Angourie Rice, Reneé Rapp, Auliʻi Cravalho, Christopher Briney and Busy Philipps, while Fey reprises her role as Ms Norbury. Justin Chang of the LA Times said the decision to have some of the songs ""mediated by the screens and filters of social media"" results in a film that feels more like ""Meme Girls"". ""Why does it all feel so laborious and overworked, so frantically self-regarding?"" he asked. ""It has something to do with the insipid quality of the songs, none of which threaten to lodge themselves in your brain the way the first movie's lines so effortlessly do."" Rolling Stone's David Fear agreed. ""The fact that the directors lean heavily on TikTok stylistics and faux-phone recordings for a lot of their numbers makes sense on the page, since that's how so much musical content gets created and consumed these days,"" he said. ""By the time that trope gets used for the gajillionth time during a musical number that would have benefited from a bit more visual breathing room, however, you start to feel like it's become a crutch."" But there was more enthusiasm from Empire's Catherine Bray, who awarded the film four stars. ""While it might feel like nu-Mean Girls comes with a lot of sparkly pink baggage attached, in the event, from the zippy opening prologue number onwards, it's very much a case of speedy boarding onto a first-class flight of fancy that requires zero familiarity with previous incarnations, but which manages to simultaneously reward loyalists with some decent inside jokes."" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw awarded the film three stars, noting there were ""plenty of laughs and fun along the way"". ""The Broadway Mean Girls was a big improvement on the film,"" he said, ""because the musical genre makes everything more amusingly histrionic - the 'diva' theme made explicit - and this movie version succeeds in the same way, although like the subsequent movie iteration it sags in the over-extended third act."" He added: ""The business invoking framing Ms Norbury as a drug-pusher always feels strained and unconvincing, with insufficient laughs to make it worthwhile, while the final resolution and Cady's learning of life-lessons take a while to arrive. Some sugar-rush musical numbers, though, and the classic gags are effectively delivered."" Deadline's Valerie Complex concluded the movie ""struggles to shine in the shadow of its predecessor"" and lacks ""a cohesive and engaging narrative"". ""[It] ultimately falters in delivering a coherent, impactful story that offers little new or compelling,"" she wrote. ""The 2004 film has cemented its place in cinema and pop culture, while the 2024 version is likely to be forgotten."" Speaking about how society had changed in recent decades, Fey told the New York Times: ""If we really had people speak to each other the way they spoke to each other in 1990, everyone would go to the hospital. People were really rough. ""People are still horrible, they're just more likely to anonymously type it. I would like to take but not teach a graduate school class on the ways in which people are just as divisive and horrible as they ever were, but now they couch it in virtue."" The film will be released in the UK on Friday 19 January.","['Film', 'Musical theatre']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9F99/production/_132275804_crmg_jw_0323_11663r.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EDB9/production/_132275806_crmg_jw_0410_20884r7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7C71/production/_132275813_crgettyimages-1918832675.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/114C9/production/_132275807_crmg_jw_0419_26610r2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13BD9/production/_132275808_crmg_jw_0328_14530r3_c.jpg']",['Steven McIntosh'],Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire was also chosen for exterior shots of the Windsor Castle stables for the series. The sixth and final season of the Netflix drama has dramatised events, including the death of Princess Diana. Mark Herrod from Lamport Hall said the crew ""put everything back where it was and we didn't notice a difference"". The 500-year-old hall has been in the hands of a private trust since the 1970s. Its drawing room was used for Clarence House when Camilla Parker Bowles, played by Olivia Williams talks to the then Prince Charles, depicted by Dominic West, ahead of their marriage. The estate also has a well preserved Edwardian stable block, which was filled with horses, hay and riding tack for the first time in 60 years during filming. Mr Herrod, the hall's executive director, said while the crew were on site he ""held them hostage"" to show them as many potential sites as possible for additional shots. The show's antique specialists carefully removed and replaced furniture from the room, but photos of the Isham family - who originally owned the home - were left in place and could be seen in shot. He said the crew were ""only taking things out we were happy for them to move"". Imelda Staunton, Jonathan Pryce and Olivia Coleman also filmed scenes on the site and were among more than 200 members of cast and crew to visit, using four acres of the hall's grounds. Mr Herrod said filming ""always inflicts wear and tear"" on site and the money raised from the shoot would go back into the maintenance of the property and grounds. ""It's very exciting to have a film crew on site,"" he said. The final season of the show also includes Prince William meeting Kate Middleton, as well as the death of Princess Margaret. Lamport Hall had previous featured on the BBC's Countryfile programme, and was used for scenes from the 2006 Steve Coogan film, A Cock and Bull Story.

James Atkinson, 23, died from a peanut allergy after eating pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. There is no evidence to suggest he told staff about his condition. Chef Muhammad Iqbal, 69, told the inquest he could not dispense an order if he was alerted to a warning about a customer's peanut allergy. Mr Atkinson, originally from Leeds, had ordered takeaway pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, and became unwell shortly afterwards. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the computer programmer died at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary under an hour after ingesting peanuts. Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son ""had a gift of making others happy"", and they added that his death had left an ""insurmountable hole"" in their hearts. Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton said Mr Atkinson had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy ten years ago and had been ""very good"" at monitoring the allergy. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, the inquest was told on Monday. An inspection of the restaurant after Mr Atkinson's death showed that peanut powder had been used in the preparation of the chicken tikka masala pizza. On Wednesday, environmental health officer Claire George told the hearing that the allergen sections of the restaurant's food safety management documents were later found to be blank. Mr Iqbal told the inquest on Thursday that he had 30 years of experience and had taken an official food safety course about allergens. Dadyal, in Howard Street, has been closed for about two years. Coroner Karen Dilks asked what he would do if an order contained a warning that the customer had a peanut allergy. Speaking through an interpreter, he said: ""I would have refused."" Mrs Dilks asked if that was because the powder that was available that day to make the masala curry included peanuts. He replied: ""Because if anybody has an allergy with peanuts, you cannot dispense the order."" Restaurant owner Ehsan Ulhaq agreed that although the chicken tikka masala on the menu listed among its ingredients almonds, cashews and coconut, in fact a nut mix powder, which included peanuts, was used. The owner said there were signs in the restaurant and on menus asking customers to tell staff if they had a food allergy. The inquest was adjourned until Friday.

Patients scored symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress on a mobile app, as well as logging their weight. Each time the score for depressive symptoms increased, the person's weight one month later was up, academics said. The participants logged their personal data over a period of six to nine months between August 2020 and April 2021. Those defined as overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of between 25 and 29.9, recorded an average increase of 52g for every point increase. Patients classed as obese, with a BMI of more than 30, recorded weight gain of 71g. Researchers found no evidence of the effect among people with a healthy BMI below 25. First author Dr Julia Mueller said the findings suggested overweight or obese people were more vulnerable to gaining weight when depressed and should be monitored to avoid this. ""Although the weight gain was relatively small, even small weight changes occurring over short periods of time can lead to larger weight changes in the long term, particularly among those with overweight and obesity,"" Dr Mueller added. ""People with a high BMI are already at greater risk from other health conditions, so this could potentially lead to a further deterioration in their health."" The study found no evidence of changes in stress or anxiety leading to weight gain. Dr Mueller said the team ""can't draw any firm conclusions about what caused"" the findings, given it was an observational study. She added: ""Our findings suggest that people may react to negative emotions in different ways."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?
