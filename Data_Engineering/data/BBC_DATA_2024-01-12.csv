https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67944903,Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide case,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.",2024-01-12,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide. South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ. South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza. It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity. The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case. Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart. On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere. South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening. Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war. In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"". South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"". Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"". He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas. On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"". Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"". ""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"". ""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation."" Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said. What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched. A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.","['South Africa', 'International Court of Justice', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war']",,"['By Raffi Berg in London & Anna Holligan at The Hague', 'BBC News']",Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67759593,What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?,Global supply chains are facing severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea.,2024-01-12,"Global supply chains are facing severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea. Attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen on commercial vessels have resulted in many firms deciding to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, though it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in response to the attacks on shipping. The Houthis have been stepping up their attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The group, which is backed by Iran, has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Ships usually take this route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north. But because of the attacks and the threat of future assaults, several of the world's largest shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels away to a much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent. BP has also paused all shipments of oil through the Red Sea, blaming the ""deteriorating security situation"". The longer journeys add at least 10 days to shipping times and cost companies millions of dollars. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come via the strait of Bab al-Mandab and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). About nine million barrels of oil per day were shipped through the Suez Canal in the first half of 2023, according to freight analytics firm Vortexa. Analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence said nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. But it is not just about oil. Container ships carry all sorts of consumer goods seen in the shops including TVs, clothes, trainers and sports equipment. It is inevitable that supply chains will be affected due to ships being diverted away from the Red Sea, but consumer goods ""will face the largest impact"", according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, though he does note the current disruption has occurred ""during the off-peak shipping season"". Delays to products reaching shops can be expected, due to the Cape of Good Hope route adding about 3,500 nautical miles. Furniture giant Ikea and UK retailer Next have both warned that supplies of products could be delayed if disruption to shipping continues. Tesla has suspended manufacturing at its only European electric car factory due to supplies being disrupted. The extra distance will also cost companies more. According to supply chain advisers Drewry, the price of using a 40ft container has risen by 15% in the past week. These extra costs could be passed on by businesses to customers. However, container rates are still far below the levels seen in 2021, when freight charges soared in line with demand as Covid restrictions were eased. There are also fears the disruption could push up oil prices. A rise in oil prices, a key ingredient in car fuel, can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%. When it comes to shipments of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) being disrupted, even if wholesale energy prices rise, any increases would not feed through to domestic bills until April 2024 at the earliest. This is because the energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, has already been set for January. Is moving freight by sea the only option? Mr Rogers says transporting goods by rail instead would require ""crossing Russia"", which is under economic sanctions due to invading Ukraine, while ""trucking from the Gulf to Israel may only offset around 3% of shipping"". The US had launched an international naval operation in December to try to protect ships on the Red Sea route. This operation was joined by countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain, but some shipping companies remained reluctant to start using the route again. Maersk resumed shipments through the Red Sea briefly following the introduction of the security operation, but paused sailings again after one of its container ships came under attack. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen. ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" US President Joe Biden said.","['Companies', 'Shipping containers', 'Yemen', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Shipping industry', 'Houthis', 'BP']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12641/production/_132092357_houthis.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8528/production/_132288043_suez_canal_alternative_route-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/108FF/production/_132093876_red_sea_trade-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Michael Race', 'Business reporter, BBC News']",Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954152,Sunak vows that Ukraine will never be alone as he pledges £2.5bn package,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year.",2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year. It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles. Mr Sunak said he was confident allies ""will come together to continue to support Ukraine"". In the US, Republicans are blocking a $60bn (£47bn) package of support for Ukraine in an attempt to increase spending on tackling migration along America's southern border. And in the EU, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has blocked a €50bn (£43bn) support package for Ukraine in a funding row with Brussels.

Yampil, a 12-year-old Asiatic black bear, was one of the few animals to survive the attack in the Donetsk region. Named after the village where he was found, rescuers initially moved him to an animal sanctuary in Belgium. He has now been permanently rehomed to the Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian. Zoo staff told BBC Scotland News that the bear seemed ""relaxed"" despite the 690-mile trip, and was already enjoying snacking on his favourite food of cucumbers soon after arrival. However he will be closely watched to see if he exhibits any issues similar to post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) after being in a warzone. Yampil was concussed by shellfire when he was discovered in eastern Ukraine in October 2022. Most of the other 200 animals at the zoo had been killed during fierce fighting in the area. He was taken through Poland to the Natuurhulpcentrum animal sanctuary in Belgium, but now has a permanent home in West Calder. Zoo staff are now optimistic the animal will be on the road to recovery, after what they described as a ""fairly complicated"" journey to Scotland, which saw him travel overnight from Dover. Adam Welsh, the zoo's head of education, told the BBC: ""Yampil has been through a lot. He could have arrived and been incredibly nervous about meeting people. We wanted to make sure we were very delicate when he arrived, so there was no loud noises. He's experienced some really horrible things. ""Time will tell, but he seems remarkably calm, remarkably chilled out and he's been eating already. He's come out his crate, he's been eating, drinking and relaxing - that's nice to see and we're really hoping that continues."" Mr Welsh added that he was relieved that bringing Yampil north of the border had progressed smoothly. Brian Curran, owner of Five Sisters Zoo, previously stated that zoo staff's ""hearts broke"" when they first saw the bear, which was concussed after a shell had landed near him. Yampil will stay in a temporary enclosure while staff watch to see if he enters torpor - a state similar to hibernation over the winter. The zoo has been fundraising to cover the £200,000 cost of a new enclosure for Yampil, and have raised around £60,000 of their target so far. The Asiatic black bear - also known as moon bears because of crescent-shaped yellow fur on their chests -  are classed as a vulnerable species by conservation groups, with estimates suggesting there are fewer than 60,000 of them left in the world.","['West Calder', 'Animals', 'Bears', 'War in Ukraine']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/621F/production/_132291152_bear2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B962/production/_132285474_bear.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EA0/production/_132282102_yampilrescue.jpg']",,War in Ukraine,

Chris Parry, 28, from Truro in Cornwall, died alongside fellow volunteer Andrew Bagshaw in January 2023. His father Rob Parry said his son had ""from an early age hated injustice"" and that is what motivated his work. His mother Christine Parry said: ""They should never have been killed - they were evacuators."" Following an inquest, his parents understand he was killed by two gunshots at close range, to the head and torso, and not by tank fire as was initially suspected. Both Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw were helping to evacuate a woman from an area of heavy bombardment in eastern Ukraine when they were killed. Mrs Parry said: ""We don't know who did it, when they did it or even why they did it. ""The best we can hope for is that they recognise it as an unlawful killing. Ideally what we would like is for it to be acknowledged as a war crime but whether that will happen we don't know."" Since his death Mr and Mrs Parry, and their daughter Kate have travelled to Ukraine to deliver vehicles to help those needing to be taken to safety.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-67935171,"Default 20mph limit plan for Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole",Councillors have renewed a pledge to cut the urban speed limit in a seaside conurbation to 20mph (32km/h).,2024-01-12,"Councillors have renewed a pledge to cut the urban speed limit in a seaside conurbation to 20mph (32km/h). Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council wants to lower speed limits to cut pollution and improve road safety. Deputy leader Millie Earl said the parties that make up the ruling Three Towns Alliance had campaigned on the 20mph issue ahead of the last election. The Conservative group described the plans as ""anti-car measures"". Responding to a question from cycling campaigner Adam Osman at Tuesday's council meeting, Ms Earl said a default 20mph limit in urban areas ""would be beneficial to walking, wheeling and cycling"" as well as benefiting public health and air quality. She said her ward of Newtown and Heatherlands in Poole had already seen the benefits of 20mph zones. ""I would like to see other communities able to benefit from the safer and healthier environment as we have,"" she said. ""There will be some roads that are exempt on the basis of need and capacity, and it is also likely the roll-out will take some time."" Ms Earl said the council was working with Dorset Police on the plan and was keen to hear the views of the community. She added: ""We have a meeting later this week with the 20's Plenty for Us organisation so we can learn from their experience in other places that have implemented change."" Cabinet is due to discuss the plans in April, after which a public consultation will be held on any proposed changes. Conservative group leader Philip Broadhead described the proposals as ""quite from the blue"" and ""extremely worrying"". He said: ""Many of us warned that voting for these parties would see a return to anti-car measures, and this announcement... shows that we were right."" Mr Osman said reducing the limit was the most ""cost efficient"" way to cut road deaths, reduce car journeys, encourage cycling and improve air quality. In September, Wales became the first UK nation to lower speed limits in residential areas from 30mph (48km/h) to 20mph. More than 467,000 people have signed a petition calling for the move to be reversed. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

The overflowing River Congo, passing through much of the country, has also swamped places outside the capital. The vast, vital waterway has reached its highest level in six decades. More than 300 people have died in floods over the past months, officials say. On Thursday, residents in the impoverished megacity of Kinshasa told the BBC how ""schools, hospitals and churches"" have been washed away. ""I had lived here with my relatives... I have lost everything,"" Jonas Mungindami said. Similarly, Denise Tuzola said her house is now ""full of water"". ""There is no church here any more and there is no way for the children to go to school,"" she added. Kinshasa is home to several small rivers and streams, which often double as open sewers. Many have now overflown. On one flooded street, a man waded through through thigh-level water, hauling a canoe full of passengers behind him. Trucks drove cautiously through the same waters, while dozens of discarded bottles bob on the surface. The RVF, the agency overseeing DR Congo's waterways, sounded the alarm in late December. It warned that heavy rains would cause ""exceptional flooding"" around the Kinshasa area. By this point, provinces such as Mongala and Ituri had already faced serious flooding. In Kinshasa, flooding is common but this year the River Congo has risen just shy of 6.26 metres, the level reached during record flooding in 1961. Further upstream, in the city of Kisangani, the mayor said that over 200 houses have been submerged. The Congo River has also caused turmoil in Congo-Brazzaville, a nation that borders DR Congo. Flooding there has impacted more than 336,000 people and 34 health facilities, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Just over a year ago, floods in Kinshasa left more than 120 people dead.","['Environment', 'Democratic Republic of Congo']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3320/production/_132288031_gettyimages-1915748071.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11998/production/_132288027_congoflood.png']","['By Wedaeli Chibelushi & Chinois Mbelechi Msoshi', 'BBC News, London and Kinshasa']",World,Africa

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67951537,Cape Verde reaches malaria-free milestone,A sub-Saharan African nation has been declared malaria-free for the first time in 50 years.,2024-01-12,"A sub-Saharan African nation has been declared malaria-free for the first time in 50 years. Cape Verde was given the status by the World Health Organization (WHO) as it has not reported a single case of local transmission in three years. Experts have described this as a major achievement. Malaria is a huge killer on the continent. In 2022, 580,000 people in Africa died from the disease, amounting to 95% of fatalities worldwide. The disease is caused by a complex parasite which is spread by mosquito bites. Vaccines are now being used in some places but monitoring the disease and avoiding mosquito bites are the most effective ways to prevent malaria. Cape Verde, a small island nation off the coast of West Africa, has taken years to reach this point by strengthening its health systems and increasing access to diagnosis and treatment of all cases. Surveillance officers have been detecting cases early, as well as controlling mosquitoes. Cape Verde's plan for malaria control has also ensured free care and diagnostic services for international travellers and migrants, with the aim of stemming the tide of cases imported from mainland Africa. ""This success reflects the hard work and dedication of countless health professionals, collaborators, communities and international partners. It is a testimony to what can be achieved through collective commitment to improving public health,"" Cape Verde's Health Minister Dr Filomena Gonçalves told the BBC. Dr Dorothy Achu Fosah, from the WHO Africa office, added that her organisation was ""excited and pleased"" with the results and the fact that malaria was ""kicked out"" from the country. Health experts say Cape Verde's achievement sets a big example for other small countries on the continent, showing that containment and elimination policies can work. Malaria was once detected on all of Cape Verde's nine inhabited islands, but in recent years could only be found on one, Sáo Tiago - where the final efforts were concentrated. The WHO's Dr Achu said the fact that the country is an archipelago is also an important factor in its success. On an island, it is easier to map out the areas most affected by the disease and see how it is being transferred from one island to another, compared to a continuous land mass. In badly affected countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is a highly mobile population regularly crossing borders, making it difficult for one country to eradicate the disease on its own. Cape Verde's success ""gives us hope that with existing tools, as well as new ones including vaccines, we can dare to dream of a malaria-free world"", WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The last country in sub-Saharan Africa to be declared malaria-free was the island nation of Mauritius in 1973. Algeria, in North Africa, achieved this status in 2019.

In badly affected countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is a highly mobile population regularly crossing borders, making it difficult for one country to eradicate the disease on its own. Cape Verde's success ""gives us hope that with existing tools, as well as new ones including vaccines, we can dare to dream of a malaria-free world"", WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The last country in sub-Saharan Africa to be declared malaria-free was the island nation of Mauritius in 1973. Algeria, in North Africa, achieved this status in 2019.

South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ. South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza. It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity. The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case. Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart. On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere. South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening. Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war. In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"". South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"". Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"". He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas. On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"". Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"". ""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"". ""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation."" Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said. What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched. A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.","['South Africa', 'International Court of Justice', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war']",,"['By Raffi Berg in London & Anna Holligan at The Hague', 'BBC News']",World,Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-12,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations' top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide. But its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""This legal action does not serve the court of peace. The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. ""Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa. ""As a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, discrimination, racism and state-sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the right side of history.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944687,Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill.,2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has warned she will vote against it unless he accepts ""improvements"" to strengthen the legislation. More than 50 MPs on the right of the party, including Liz Truss, are now backing moves to toughen up the bill. The prime minister is trying to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda after the Supreme Court ruled the earlier scheme was unlawful. Meanwhile, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, has backed three amendments which would tone down some parts of the bill. Mrs Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak in November, told GB News the current version of the bill ""does not work"" and would amount to ""a betrayal to the British public"". The legislation will return to the Commons next Tuesday and Wednesday, when MPs will debate and vote on a series of amendments. It will then face a final Commons vote which it must clear to be sent to the Lords for further scrutiny. Asked how she would vote at this stage if there were no changes, Mrs Braverman replied: ""If there are no improvements to it, I will have to vote against it, I'm afraid. I am sent to Parliament to vote for things, to be for things or to be against them, not to sit on the fence. ""I owe it to the British people to be transparent and honest about the situation that we are in. It is absolutely essential that we deliver on this pledge to stop the boats."" Writing on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, former prime minister Ms Truss said: ""We need to crack down on illegal migration and remove the loopholes being exploited by activist lawyers. ""It's essential the legislation we are passing is watertight. That's why I am backing amendments to the Bill."" Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned last month over the legislation and is co-ordinating a series of rebel amendments, has warned the bill as it stands is ""guaranteed to fail"". Illegal migrants would continue to successfully challenge their removal in court, in a fresh ""merry-go-round"" of appeals, he said. The government insists the legislation, the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, will allow only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. But the amendments backed by Sir Robert would delete clauses from the bill declaring Rwanda ""a safe country"", disapplying the Human Rights Act, and forcing courts to disregard interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The One Nation group is the largest single faction within the Conservative parliamentary party. It says more than 100 MPs are members, almost a third of the total. It argues that the UK's human rights obligations in international law must be respected. Former first secretary of state Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he had been assured the bill would not be strengthened. ""The prime minister's looked me in the eye and said that he doesn't want to go any further,"" he told the New Statesman. The Rwandan government has said it will pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said the government would carry on talking to MPs and ""carefully consider"" amendments put forward. It had worked to ensure the bill was ""robust"", No 10 added. Before Christmas, Mr Sunak comfortably saw off a Tory rebellion over the bill, when it cleared its first Commons hurdle by a majority of 44 votes. But the scale of party divisions on the issue has again been highlighted in recent days - with a number of former cabinet ministers, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, backing the amendments from MPs on the right of the party. Nearly two years after Boris Johnson's government first announced plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, none has been sent to the east African country. The bill aims to stop flights being grounded by legal action by declaring that, in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country. It would enable ministers to ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight there while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it would still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore ECHR injunctions, blocking flights. The prime minister has promised to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and argues his Rwanda scheme will prove a significant deterrent. Labour says the scheme is a hugely expensive ""gimmick"" which will not work, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused Mr Sunak of being ""taken hostage by his own party"". It says it would tackle illegal migration by prioritising the smashing of people-smuggling gangs. The government has a working Commons majority over other parties and independent MPs of 56, implying that 29 Conservative MPs would need to vote against the bill to defeat it. But in practice that majority is larger because some independent MPs usually vote with the government and others tend to be absent. In addition to this, some Tory rebels are likely to abstain, while others may also vote with the government. If the bill does clear its Commons stages, it is likely to face prolonged opposition in the Lords. Meanwhile, the Home Office has published a report on ""safe and legal routes"" for migrants seeking to enter the UK, but it does not list any new routes. Campaigners have long argued that the government needs to provide safe routes for people seeking refuge from war and oppression, to help tackle illegal migration. During debates on the Illegal Migration Act, which became law in July 2023 and bars anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum, ministers promised to ""specify additional safe and legal routes"". No 10 said there were already a significant number of routes and its priority was to secure the UK's borders. ""While the compassion of the UK is clearly unlimited, our capacity is not,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. In a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the report reaffirmed the government's ""commitment to providing safe and legal routes for those most in need"". ""As we get control on numbers, we will keep under review whether we are able to do more to support vulnerable refugees and whether we need to consider new safe and legal routes,"" he added. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon described the report as ""woefully inadequate with no meaningful commitment to expand safe routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Syria, and those fleeing repressive regimes in countries such as Iran"". ""By simply focusing on describing the existing limited schemes, the government has completely overlooked the urgent need to reduce dangerous Channel crossings by providing safe passage to our shores,"" he said.","['Conservative Party', 'Rwanda', 'Migration', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Liz Truss', 'Suella Braverman', 'Refugees and asylum seekers', 'UK immigration', 'Robert Buckland']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13E01/production/_132290418_e37113d501a071f307251cbc00b0b4db9a8d54ba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C14F/production/_132278494_49df87243c4fd2e37537c4637e12e27615f254c3.jpg']","['By Chas Geiger', 'Political reporter']",World,Africa

The overflowing River Congo, passing through much of the country, has also swamped places outside the capital. The vast, vital waterway has reached its highest level in six decades. More than 300 people have died in floods over the past months, officials say. On Thursday, residents in the impoverished megacity of Kinshasa told the BBC how ""schools, hospitals and churches"" have been washed away. ""I had lived here with my relatives... I have lost everything,"" Jonas Mungindami said. Similarly, Denise Tuzola said her house is now ""full of water"". ""There is no church here any more and there is no way for the children to go to school,"" she added. Kinshasa is home to several small rivers and streams, which often double as open sewers. Many have now overflown. On one flooded street, a man waded through through thigh-level water, hauling a canoe full of passengers behind him. Trucks drove cautiously through the same waters, while dozens of discarded bottles bob on the surface. The RVF, the agency overseeing DR Congo's waterways, sounded the alarm in late December. It warned that heavy rains would cause ""exceptional flooding"" around the Kinshasa area. By this point, provinces such as Mongala and Ituri had already faced serious flooding. In Kinshasa, flooding is common but this year the River Congo has risen just shy of 6.26 metres, the level reached during record flooding in 1961. Further upstream, in the city of Kisangani, the mayor said that over 200 houses have been submerged. The Congo River has also caused turmoil in Congo-Brazzaville, a nation that borders DR Congo. Flooding there has impacted more than 336,000 people and 34 health facilities, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67951537,Cape Verde reaches malaria-free milestone,A sub-Saharan African nation has been declared malaria-free for the first time in 50 years.,2024-01-12,"A sub-Saharan African nation has been declared malaria-free for the first time in 50 years. Cape Verde was given the status by the World Health Organization (WHO) as it has not reported a single case of local transmission in three years. Experts have described this as a major achievement. Malaria is a huge killer on the continent. In 2022, 580,000 people in Africa died from the disease, amounting to 95% of fatalities worldwide. The disease is caused by a complex parasite which is spread by mosquito bites. Vaccines are now being used in some places but monitoring the disease and avoiding mosquito bites are the most effective ways to prevent malaria. Cape Verde, a small island nation off the coast of West Africa, has taken years to reach this point by strengthening its health systems and increasing access to diagnosis and treatment of all cases. Surveillance officers have been detecting cases early, as well as controlling mosquitoes. Cape Verde's plan for malaria control has also ensured free care and diagnostic services for international travellers and migrants, with the aim of stemming the tide of cases imported from mainland Africa. ""This success reflects the hard work and dedication of countless health professionals, collaborators, communities and international partners. It is a testimony to what can be achieved through collective commitment to improving public health,"" Cape Verde's Health Minister Dr Filomena Gonçalves told the BBC. Dr Dorothy Achu Fosah, from the WHO Africa office, added that her organisation was ""excited and pleased"" with the results and the fact that malaria was ""kicked out"" from the country. Health experts say Cape Verde's achievement sets a big example for other small countries on the continent, showing that containment and elimination policies can work. Malaria was once detected on all of Cape Verde's nine inhabited islands, but in recent years could only be found on one, Sáo Tiago - where the final efforts were concentrated. The WHO's Dr Achu said the fact that the country is an archipelago is also an important factor in its success.

Cape Verde was given the status by the World Health Organization (WHO) as it has not reported a single case of local transmission in three years. Experts have described this as a major achievement. Malaria is a huge killer on the continent. In 2022, 580,000 people in Africa died from the disease, amounting to 95% of fatalities worldwide. The disease is caused by a complex parasite which is spread by mosquito bites. Vaccines are now being used in some places but monitoring the disease and avoiding mosquito bites are the most effective ways to prevent malaria. Cape Verde, a small island nation off the coast of West Africa, has taken years to reach this point by strengthening its health systems and increasing access to diagnosis and treatment of all cases. Surveillance officers have been detecting cases early, as well as controlling mosquitoes. Cape Verde's plan for malaria control has also ensured free care and diagnostic services for international travellers and migrants, with the aim of stemming the tide of cases imported from mainland Africa. ""This success reflects the hard work and dedication of countless health professionals, collaborators, communities and international partners.

More than 300 people have died in floods over the past months, officials say. On Thursday, residents in the impoverished megacity of Kinshasa told the BBC how ""schools, hospitals and churches"" have been washed away. ""I had lived here with my relatives... I have lost everything,"" Jonas Mungindami said. Similarly, Denise Tuzola said her house is now ""full of water"". ""There is no church here any more and there is no way for the children to go to school,"" she added. Kinshasa is home to several small rivers and streams, which often double as open sewers. Many have now overflown. On one flooded street, a man waded through through thigh-level water, hauling a canoe full of passengers behind him. Trucks drove cautiously through the same waters, while dozens of discarded bottles bob on the surface. The RVF, the agency overseeing DR Congo's waterways, sounded the alarm in late December. It warned that heavy rains would cause ""exceptional flooding"" around the Kinshasa area. By this point, provinces such as Mongala and Ituri had already faced serious flooding. In Kinshasa, flooding is common but this year the River Congo has risen just shy of 6.26 metres, the level reached during record flooding in 1961. Further upstream, in the city of Kisangani, the mayor said that over 200 houses have been submerged. The Congo River has also caused turmoil in Congo-Brazzaville, a nation that borders DR Congo.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67944903,Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide case,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.",2024-01-12,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide. South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ. South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza. It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity. The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case. Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart. On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere. South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening. Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war. In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"". South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"". Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"". He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas. On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"". Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"". ""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"". ""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation."" Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said. What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched.

The overflowing River Congo, passing through much of the country, has also swamped places outside the capital. The vast, vital waterway has reached its highest level in six decades. More than 300 people have died in floods over the past months, officials say. On Thursday, residents in the impoverished megacity of Kinshasa told the BBC how ""schools, hospitals and churches"" have been washed away. ""I had lived here with my relatives... I have lost everything,"" Jonas Mungindami said. Similarly, Denise Tuzola said her house is now ""full of water"". ""There is no church here any more and there is no way for the children to go to school,"" she added. Kinshasa is home to several small rivers and streams, which often double as open sewers. Many have now overflown. On one flooded street, a man waded through through thigh-level water, hauling a canoe full of passengers behind him. Trucks drove cautiously through the same waters, while dozens of discarded bottles bob on the surface. The RVF, the agency overseeing DR Congo's waterways, sounded the alarm in late December. It warned that heavy rains would cause ""exceptional flooding"" around the Kinshasa area. By this point, provinces such as Mongala and Ituri had already faced serious flooding. In Kinshasa, flooding is common but this year the River Congo has risen just shy of 6.26 metres, the level reached during record flooding in 1961. Further upstream, in the city of Kisangani, the mayor said that over 200 houses have been submerged. The Congo River has also caused turmoil in Congo-Brazzaville, a nation that borders DR Congo. Flooding there has impacted more than 336,000 people and 34 health facilities, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Just over a year ago, floods in Kinshasa left more than 120 people dead.","['Environment', 'Democratic Republic of Congo']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3320/production/_132288031_gettyimages-1915748071.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11998/production/_132288027_congoflood.png']","['By Wedaeli Chibelushi & Chinois Mbelechi Msoshi', 'BBC News, London and Kinshasa']",World,Africa

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-12,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations' top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide. But its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""This legal action does not serve the court of peace. The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. ""Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa. ""As a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, discrimination, racism and state-sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the right side of history.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67911167,Annapoorani: Netflix removes Nayanthara film after backlash from Hindu groups,"An Indian film that received backlash for ""hurting Hindu religious sentiments"" has been removed from Netflix, days after it began streaming.",2024-01-12,"An Indian film that received backlash for ""hurting Hindu religious sentiments"" has been removed from Netflix, days after it began streaming. Netflix said the Tamil-language film - Annapoorani: The Goddess of Food - was removed at its ""licensor's request"". The movie stars actor Nayanthara as a Hindu Brahmin woman who aspires to become a chef. She is shown going against her family's religious beliefs and eating meat and learning to cook it. Many Brahmins do not eat meat, in accordance with rigid caste rules. Members of hard-line Hindu organisations had objected to this and other scenes in the movie, including one where the actress is shown offering namaz, or Muslim prayers, before cooking biriyani. Some Hindus also took offence at a scene where a Muslim character says that Hindu god Ram ate meat. The film's producers have not officially commented on the issue yet. A police case has also been filed  in Madhya Pradesh state against Nayanthara and two others associated with the film. Supporters of hard-line Hindu groups have accused many films and shows in recent years of insulting religious sentiments. In 2021, the cast and crew of an Amazon Prime show, Tandav, apologised after being accused of mocking Hindu gods. Annapoorani released in theatres on 1 December and got mixed reviews from critics - it was praised for showing a woman from an orthodox family following her dreams, but some called it ""an-all-you-can-eat buffet of undercooked subplots"". It was cleared by India's Central Board of Film Certification - known as the censor board - which reviews movies for public exhibition. But the controversy began weeks later when people watched it on Netflix, where it began streaming on 29 December. Last week, a man named Ramesh Solanki filed a police complaint in Mumbai objecting to several scenes - a case hasn't been registered there yet. Mr Solanki describes himself as a ""proud Hindu Indian nationalist"" on X (formerly Twitter). Reuters reported that members of the hard-line Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) shouted slogans outside the Netflix office in Mumbai. On Thursday, Mr Solanki and a VHP spokesperson shared a letter of apology from Zee Entertainment Enterprises - the parent company of Zee Studios, which co-produced Annapoorani. ""We have no intentions as co-producers of the film to hurt the religious sentiments of the Hindus and Brahmins community,"" the letter said. It also said the producers would address the concerns about the film and were working with Netflix to remove the film from its platform ""until edited"". Zee did not respond to the BBC's email seeking comment. While some said they were happy at the movie being taken off Netflix, others have expressed dismay. Actress Parvathy Thiruvothu said this would set a ""dangerous precedent"". Additional reporting by Nikhila Henry in Delhi BBC News India is now on YouTube.

The Karnataka Rakshana Vedike's (KRV) protest was to coerce the government to implement a law which mandates that 60% of each display sign in the city should have Kannada. KRV got some support from India's main political parties which condemned the violence but said there was no harm in demanding Kannada signages. A federal minister of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) told a local news channel, ""What is the harm in writing in Kannada, apart from English? This is not England"". None of this came as a surprise because in India - home to more than 300 languages - assertion of linguistic identities is common. For instance, pro-Tamil language protesters in Karnataka's neighbouring state Tamil Nadu have used the slogan ""Tamil Nadu is for Tamils"" since the 1930s. After India won its independence in 1947, several states in the country were formed along linguistic lines by grouping together regions which spoke the same language. Karnataka was one such state formed in 1956. KRV, which tore down the English billboards last month, has been claiming for decades that Kannada and its speakers have been relegated to the margins in the cosmopolitan city where people from across the country, and the world, work and live. In Bengaluru, four out of 10 people come from outside the city, reports say, although two-thirds of this population come from within the state. While the influx of migrants has made some local people think that they would soon become a minority in the city, KRV's ""Kannada first"" demand springs from a linguistic nationalism that has been in the making for decades. Cultural historian Janaki Nair says in a research paper that Kannada speakers first demanded a separate state in the 1920s. Ms Nair notes that, at first, Kannada nationalists were accommodative of other languages, including English. One of the Kannada nationalists even said that ""English is our cultural and political language, Sanskrit our spiritual and classical language and Kannada our native and speaking language"", she writes. ""In the beginning, this linguistic agitation was never muscular as it mainly asked for the development of the language and literature. Of late, vigorous protests have taken over the movement,"" Kannada scholar Muzaffar Assadi told the BBC. The strident protests started in the 1980s and before protesting against English, Kannada nationalists took on other Indian languages - Sanskrit, Tamil, Urdu and Hindi - scholars say. The first of the vigorous protests was the Gokak agitation of 1982 which demanded that Kannada be made the sole first language in schools instead of Sanskrit. The Kannada film industry supported this protest, with superstar Rajkumar spearheading the movement. This was followed by protests against Tamil Nadu in 1991 which gripped Bengaluru and Mysuru cities. The dispute was over sharing of water in the Cauvery river which courses through both the states. Neither Tamil speakers nor Kannada speakers wanted the other to have the larger water share. Later, in 1996, major protests broke out when state broadcaster Doordarshan started programming in Urdu language. A decade later, in 2017, Kannada nationalists led by KRV, took on Hindi. The protesters demanded removal of Hindi from signages and public announcements on Bengaluru Metro line. ""Namma Metro, Hindi Beda,"" meaning 'no Hindi in our Metro' trended for days on social media. Kannada nationalists started protesting against English only after India's IT boom started in the 1990s and the demand for for English-speaking workers rose. There was a general anxiety among many Kannadigas that English speakers from other states were taking away their jobs, and KRV started demanding the implementation of quotas or affirmative action for ""sons of the soil"", as recommended by the Sarojini Mahishi committee of the 1980s. KRV officials say they support regional languages over others as India's federalism is rooted in regional autonomy and English signages get in the way of that. They add that they are not against multinational companies where English is crucial for work. ""We only think Kannada and its people should come first,"" says Arun Javgal, organisational secretary of KRV, who works in the IT field himself. Most manifestations of Kannada nationalism, however, go unopposed in the state with a section of Kannada speakers fervently supporting KRV's demands. Mr Javgal claims his organisation has a lot of support in the state, including in Bengaluru. But can the recent protests and change in signages from English to Kannada affect brand Bengaluru's global image? It will not, says Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), which represents commercial establishments in the state. ""It's the diligent workforce of Bengaluru which built the brand and they would continue to do good work even if the signages change,"" FKCCI president Ramesh Chandra says, adding that they have requested ""commercial establishments to follow the law and use Kannada prominently in signages"". The deadline for changing the signages is 28 February. As for KRV, its leaders say if European countries can have billboards in their local languages, so can Karnataka which has a population of 61.1 million, of which a majority are Kannada speakers.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67948573,US election 2024: Can Nikki Haley really stop Donald Trump?,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat.",2024-01-12,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat. On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border. At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normalcy, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump. ""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said. The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines. Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back. Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls. ""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday. The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with."" The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points. Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics: that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense. ""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project. ""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do."" So what exactly is her game plan? Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win. They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election. In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. At a Wednesday evening debate between the two, Ms Haley strained to position herself as Mr Trump's sole rival. ""I wish Donald Trump was on this stage. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said. Campaign aides told the BBC that the goal for Ms Haley in Iowa is simple: build momentum. A strong showing, they said, would carry her into New Hampshire - where polls with Mr Trump are much tighter - and then on to South Carolina, her home state. Ms Haley may be helped by the sudden exit of anti-Trump candidate, Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign this week. Supporters of the former New Jersey Governor, surveys suggest, are most likely to flock to her. Less helpful was Mr Christie's hot-mic moment, when he was caught saying she would ""get smoked"", presumably by Mr Trump. ""She's not up to this,"" he said. Long-time observers counter that Ms Haley has a knack for defying expectations. ""If you look at her career, a lot of people have underestimated her and a lot of people have been wrong,"" said Randy Covington, a veteran journalist from South Carolina. Even her critics acknowledge that she is a master of retail politics - the door-knocking and handshaking that delivered her to the statehouse in 2005. She stunned her own party in the primary by unseating Larry Koon, then the longest-serving member of the House. At the time, Ms Haley had no political experience and was a bookkeeper for her family's clothing shop. Nearly 20 years later, the state representative-turned-governor-turned-UN-ambassador still likes to introduce herself first as an accountant. She points out that she is a mom of two, the wife of a combat veteran and the child of Indian immigrants, running to make her family proud. In televised debates, in pancake houses and town halls, Ms Haley pauses mid-speech for a smile and pointed eye contact. She's a down-home American hard at work for your vote. ""She connects, she has the X factor,"" said David Wilkins, a former South Carolina House speaker who led Ms Haley's transition to the governor's house. ""The more people who are exposed to her, the more support she's going to get, it's just that simple."" Ms Haley's campaign often looks and sounds like something out of 2012: more compromise and pragmatism, fewer grievances and conspiracy theories. She is a staunch conservative, but she speaks with nuance on hot button issues like abortion and immigration, and is less eager to wade into the country's culture wars. In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces. ""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted."" Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election. ""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points."" But she has to defeat Mr Trump first. ""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant. At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley. ""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider."" The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre. She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else. Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming. In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"". Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations. Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first."" The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa. The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","['Nikki Haley', 'Donald Trump', 'US election 2024', 'United States', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED42/production/_132283706_nikkismiling.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7812/production/_132283703_nikkitop.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4AE/production/_132283626_ronandnikki.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5DA/production/_132283926_gettyimages-1926034122.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Holly Honderich', 'in Des Moines, Iowa']",World,Asia

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67911167,Annapoorani: Netflix removes Nayanthara film after backlash from Hindu groups,"An Indian film that received backlash for ""hurting Hindu religious sentiments"" has been removed from Netflix, days after it began streaming.",2024-01-12,"An Indian film that received backlash for ""hurting Hindu religious sentiments"" has been removed from Netflix, days after it began streaming. Netflix said the Tamil-language film - Annapoorani: The Goddess of Food - was removed at its ""licensor's request"". The movie stars actor Nayanthara as a Hindu Brahmin woman who aspires to become a chef. She is shown going against her family's religious beliefs and eating meat and learning to cook it. Many Brahmins do not eat meat, in accordance with rigid caste rules. Members of hard-line Hindu organisations had objected to this and other scenes in the movie, including one where the actress is shown offering namaz, or Muslim prayers, before cooking biriyani. Some Hindus also took offence at a scene where a Muslim character says that Hindu god Ram ate meat. The film's producers have not officially commented on the issue yet. A police case has also been filed  in Madhya Pradesh state against Nayanthara and two others associated with the film. Supporters of hard-line Hindu groups have accused many films and shows in recent years of insulting religious sentiments. In 2021, the cast and crew of an Amazon Prime show, Tandav, apologised after being accused of mocking Hindu gods. Annapoorani released in theatres on 1 December and got mixed reviews from critics - it was praised for showing a woman from an orthodox family following her dreams, but some called it ""an-all-you-can-eat buffet of undercooked subplots"". It was cleared by India's Central Board of Film Certification - known as the censor board - which reviews movies for public exhibition. But the controversy began weeks later when people watched it on Netflix, where it began streaming on 29 December. Last week, a man named Ramesh Solanki filed a police complaint in Mumbai objecting to several scenes - a case hasn't been registered there yet. Mr Solanki describes himself as a ""proud Hindu Indian nationalist"" on X (formerly Twitter). Reuters reported that members of the hard-line Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) shouted slogans outside the Netflix office in Mumbai. On Thursday, Mr Solanki and a VHP spokesperson shared a letter of apology from Zee Entertainment Enterprises - the parent company of Zee Studios, which co-produced Annapoorani. ""We have no intentions as co-producers of the film to hurt the religious sentiments of the Hindus and Brahmins community,"" the letter said. It also said the producers would address the concerns about the film and were working with Netflix to remove the film from its platform ""until edited"". Zee did not respond to the BBC's email seeking comment. While some said they were happy at the movie being taken off Netflix, others have expressed dismay. Actress Parvathy Thiruvothu said this would set a ""dangerous precedent"". Additional reporting by Nikhila Henry in Delhi BBC News India is now on YouTube.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67889621,Bengaluru: Why English is dividing people in India's Silicon Valley,"In the run-up to the New Year, the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) - often called India's Silicon Valley for being home to global information-technology (IT) majors - hit the headlines after protesters tore down English billboards, demanding that they be written in the city's local language, Kannada.",2024-01-12,"In the run-up to the New Year, the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) - often called India's Silicon Valley for being home to global information-technology (IT) majors - hit the headlines after protesters tore down English billboards, demanding that they be written in the city's local language, Kannada. The Karnataka Rakshana Vedike's (KRV) protest was to coerce the government to implement a law which mandates that 60% of each display sign in the city should have Kannada. KRV got some support from India's main political parties which condemned the violence but said there was no harm in demanding Kannada signages. A federal minister of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) told a local news channel, ""What is the harm in writing in Kannada, apart from English? This is not England"". None of this came as a surprise because in India - home to more than 300 languages - assertion of linguistic identities is common. For instance, pro-Tamil language protesters in Karnataka's neighbouring state Tamil Nadu have used the slogan ""Tamil Nadu is for Tamils"" since the 1930s. After India won its independence in 1947, several states in the country were formed along linguistic lines by grouping together regions which spoke the same language. Karnataka was one such state formed in 1956. KRV, which tore down the English billboards last month, has been claiming for decades that Kannada and its speakers have been relegated to the margins in the cosmopolitan city where people from across the country, and the world, work and live. In Bengaluru, four out of 10 people come from outside the city, reports say, although two-thirds of this population come from within the state. While the influx of migrants has made some local people think that they would soon become a minority in the city, KRV's ""Kannada first"" demand springs from a linguistic nationalism that has been in the making for decades. Cultural historian Janaki Nair says in a research paper that Kannada speakers first demanded a separate state in the 1920s. Ms Nair notes that, at first, Kannada nationalists were accommodative of other languages, including English. One of the Kannada nationalists even said that ""English is our cultural and political language, Sanskrit our spiritual and classical language and Kannada our native and speaking language"", she writes. ""In the beginning, this linguistic agitation was never muscular as it mainly asked for the development of the language and literature. Of late, vigorous protests have taken over the movement,"" Kannada scholar Muzaffar Assadi told the BBC. The strident protests started in the 1980s and before protesting against English, Kannada nationalists took on other Indian languages - Sanskrit, Tamil, Urdu and Hindi - scholars say. The first of the vigorous protests was the Gokak agitation of 1982 which demanded that Kannada be made the sole first language in schools instead of Sanskrit. The Kannada film industry supported this protest, with superstar Rajkumar spearheading the movement. This was followed by protests against Tamil Nadu in 1991 which gripped Bengaluru and Mysuru cities. The dispute was over sharing of water in the Cauvery river which courses through both the states. Neither Tamil speakers nor Kannada speakers wanted the other to have the larger water share. Later, in 1996, major protests broke out when state broadcaster Doordarshan started programming in Urdu language. A decade later, in 2017, Kannada nationalists led by KRV, took on Hindi. The protesters demanded removal of Hindi from signages and public announcements on Bengaluru Metro line. ""Namma Metro, Hindi Beda,"" meaning 'no Hindi in our Metro' trended for days on social media. Kannada nationalists started protesting against English only after India's IT boom started in the 1990s and the demand for for English-speaking workers rose. There was a general anxiety among many Kannadigas that English speakers from other states were taking away their jobs, and KRV started demanding the implementation of quotas or affirmative action for ""sons of the soil"", as recommended by the Sarojini Mahishi committee of the 1980s. KRV officials say they support regional languages over others as India's federalism is rooted in regional autonomy and English signages get in the way of that. They add that they are not against multinational companies where English is crucial for work. ""We only think Kannada and its people should come first,"" says Arun Javgal, organisational secretary of KRV, who works in the IT field himself. Most manifestations of Kannada nationalism, however, go unopposed in the state with a section of Kannada speakers fervently supporting KRV's demands. Mr Javgal claims his organisation has a lot of support in the state, including in Bengaluru. But can the recent protests and change in signages from English to Kannada affect brand Bengaluru's global image? It will not, says Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), which represents commercial establishments in the state. ""It's the diligent workforce of Bengaluru which built the brand and they would continue to do good work even if the signages change,"" FKCCI president Ramesh Chandra says, adding that they have requested ""commercial establishments to follow the law and use Kannada prominently in signages"". The deadline for changing the signages is 28 February. As for KRV, its leaders say if European countries can have billboards in their local languages, so can Karnataka which has a population of 61.1 million, of which a majority are Kannada speakers.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67948573,US election 2024: Can Nikki Haley really stop Donald Trump?,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging.

If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat. On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border. At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normalcy, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump. ""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said. The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines. Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back. Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls. ""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday. The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with."" The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points. Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics: that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense. ""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project. ""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do."" So what exactly is her game plan? Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win. They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election. In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted."" Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election. ""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points."" But she has to defeat Mr Trump first. ""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant. At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley. ""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider."" The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre. She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else. Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming. In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"". Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations. Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first."" The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa. The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","['Nikki Haley', 'Donald Trump', 'US election 2024', 'United States', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED42/production/_132283706_nikkismiling.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7812/production/_132283703_nikkitop.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4AE/production/_132283626_ronandnikki.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5DA/production/_132283926_gettyimages-1926034122.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Holly Honderich', 'in Des Moines, Iowa']",World,Asia

Netflix said the Tamil-language film - Annapoorani: The Goddess of Food - was removed at its ""licensor's request"". The movie stars actor Nayanthara as a Hindu Brahmin woman who aspires to become a chef. She is shown going against her family's religious beliefs and eating meat and learning to cook it. Many Brahmins do not eat meat, in accordance with rigid caste rules. Members of hard-line Hindu organisations had objected to this and other scenes in the movie, including one where the actress is shown offering namaz, or Muslim prayers, before cooking biriyani. Some Hindus also took offence at a scene where a Muslim character says that Hindu god Ram ate meat. The film's producers have not officially commented on the issue yet. A police case has also been filed  in Madhya Pradesh state against Nayanthara and two others associated with the film. Supporters of hard-line Hindu groups have accused many films and shows in recent years of insulting religious sentiments. In 2021, the cast and crew of an Amazon Prime show, Tandav, apologised after being accused of mocking Hindu gods. Annapoorani released in theatres on 1 December and got mixed reviews from critics - it was praised for showing a woman from an orthodox family following her dreams, but some called it ""an-all-you-can-eat buffet of undercooked subplots"". It was cleared by India's Central Board of Film Certification - known as the censor board - which reviews movies for public exhibition. But the controversy began weeks later when people watched it on Netflix, where it began streaming on 29 December. Last week, a man named Ramesh Solanki filed a police complaint in Mumbai objecting to several scenes - a case hasn't been registered there yet. Mr Solanki describes himself as a ""proud Hindu Indian nationalist"" on X (formerly Twitter). Reuters reported that members of the hard-line Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) shouted slogans outside the Netflix office in Mumbai. On Thursday, Mr Solanki and a VHP spokesperson shared a letter of apology from Zee Entertainment Enterprises - the parent company of Zee Studios, which co-produced Annapoorani. ""We have no intentions as co-producers of the film to hurt the religious sentiments of the Hindus and Brahmins community,"" the letter said. It also said the producers would address the concerns about the film and were working with Netflix to remove the film from its platform ""until edited"". Zee did not respond to the BBC's email seeking comment. While some said they were happy at the movie being taken off Netflix, others have expressed dismay.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67889621,Bengaluru: Why English is dividing people in India's Silicon Valley,"In the run-up to the New Year, the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) - often called India's Silicon Valley for being home to global information-technology (IT) majors - hit the headlines after protesters tore down English billboards, demanding that they be written in the city's local language, Kannada.",2024-01-12,"In the run-up to the New Year, the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) - often called India's Silicon Valley for being home to global information-technology (IT) majors - hit the headlines after protesters tore down English billboards, demanding that they be written in the city's local language, Kannada. The Karnataka Rakshana Vedike's (KRV) protest was to coerce the government to implement a law which mandates that 60% of each display sign in the city should have Kannada. KRV got some support from India's main political parties which condemned the violence but said there was no harm in demanding Kannada signages. A federal minister of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) told a local news channel, ""What is the harm in writing in Kannada, apart from English? This is not England"". None of this came as a surprise because in India - home to more than 300 languages - assertion of linguistic identities is common. For instance, pro-Tamil language protesters in Karnataka's neighbouring state Tamil Nadu have used the slogan ""Tamil Nadu is for Tamils"" since the 1930s. After India won its independence in 1947, several states in the country were formed along linguistic lines by grouping together regions which spoke the same language. Karnataka was one such state formed in 1956. KRV, which tore down the English billboards last month, has been claiming for decades that Kannada and its speakers have been relegated to the margins in the cosmopolitan city where people from across the country, and the world, work and live. In Bengaluru, four out of 10 people come from outside the city, reports say, although two-thirds of this population come from within the state. While the influx of migrants has made some local people think that they would soon become a minority in the city, KRV's ""Kannada first"" demand springs from a linguistic nationalism that has been in the making for decades. Cultural historian Janaki Nair says in a research paper that Kannada speakers first demanded a separate state in the 1920s. Ms Nair notes that, at first, Kannada nationalists were accommodative of other languages, including English. One of the Kannada nationalists even said that ""English is our cultural and political language, Sanskrit our spiritual and classical language and Kannada our native and speaking language"", she writes. ""In the beginning, this linguistic agitation was never muscular as it mainly asked for the development of the language and literature. Of late, vigorous protests have taken over the movement,"" Kannada scholar Muzaffar Assadi told the BBC. The strident protests started in the 1980s and before protesting against English, Kannada nationalists took on other Indian languages - Sanskrit, Tamil, Urdu and Hindi - scholars say. The first of the vigorous protests was the Gokak agitation of 1982 which demanded that Kannada be made the sole first language in schools instead of Sanskrit. The Kannada film industry supported this protest, with superstar Rajkumar spearheading the movement. This was followed by protests against Tamil Nadu in 1991 which gripped Bengaluru and Mysuru cities. The dispute was over sharing of water in the Cauvery river which courses through both the states. Neither Tamil speakers nor Kannada speakers wanted the other to have the larger water share. Later, in 1996, major protests broke out when state broadcaster Doordarshan started programming in Urdu language. A decade later, in 2017, Kannada nationalists led by KRV, took on Hindi. The protesters demanded removal of Hindi from signages and public announcements on Bengaluru Metro line. ""Namma Metro, Hindi Beda,"" meaning 'no Hindi in our Metro' trended for days on social media. Kannada nationalists started protesting against English only after India's IT boom started in the 1990s and the demand for for English-speaking workers rose. There was a general anxiety among many Kannadigas that English speakers from other states were taking away their jobs, and KRV started demanding the implementation of quotas or affirmative action for ""sons of the soil"", as recommended by the Sarojini Mahishi committee of the 1980s. KRV officials say they support regional languages over others as India's federalism is rooted in regional autonomy and English signages get in the way of that. They add that they are not against multinational companies where English is crucial for work. ""We only think Kannada and its people should come first,"" says Arun Javgal, organisational secretary of KRV, who works in the IT field himself. Most manifestations of Kannada nationalism, however, go unopposed in the state with a section of Kannada speakers fervently supporting KRV's demands. Mr Javgal claims his organisation has a lot of support in the state, including in Bengaluru. But can the recent protests and change in signages from English to Kannada affect brand Bengaluru's global image? It will not, says Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), which represents commercial establishments in the state. ""It's the diligent workforce of Bengaluru which built the brand and they would continue to do good work even if the signages change,"" FKCCI president Ramesh Chandra says, adding that they have requested ""commercial establishments to follow the law and use Kannada prominently in signages"". The deadline for changing the signages is 28 February. As for KRV, its leaders say if European countries can have billboards in their local languages, so can Karnataka which has a population of 61.1 million, of which a majority are Kannada speakers.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67958284,Matteo Salvini: Italian deputy PM takes stand in migrant kidnap trial,Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has defended his hard-line approach against illegal migration during a court appearance in Sicily.,2024-01-12,"Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has defended his hard-line approach against illegal migration during a court appearance in Sicily. He is facing kidnap and dereliction of duty charges for preventing migrants from disembarking an NGO ship in 2019. He has denied the charges, saying he acted ""in the interest of national security"". At the time, Mr Salvini - the leader of the right-wing League - was interior minister in a previous government. Ahead of his court appearance, Mr Salvini said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was ""holding his head high, proud of what I did"". In August 2019, a migrant rescue vessel belonging to Spanish NGO Open Arms arrived near Italian shores carrying 147 migrants who had been rescued in the Mediterranean. Mr Salvini - who a year earlier had announced his intention to ""close the ports"" of Italy to NGO rescue ships - immediately signed a decree banning the vessel from entering Italian territorial waters. As a result, the Open Arms remained at sea for almost three weeks. Crewmembers later testified that the migrants' physical and mental wellbeing disintegrated quickly over that period, eventually reaching crisis point due to dire sanitary conditions onboard, including a scabies outbreak. On 20 August, Agrigento Prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio ordered the vessel to be preventatively seized after inspecting it and noting the ""difficult situation on board"". The blockade caused public outcry. Hollywood star Richard Gere visited the Open Arms ship in a show of support and later called upon the Italian government to assist the migrants. Mr Salvini hit back, telling Mr Gere to take the migrants ""back to Hollywood"". Today, Mr Salvini - who is now a partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition - told the court in Sicily's capital of Palermo that he thought ""the situation was not at risk"" onboard the ship. He also said that he had acted ""in full consciousness"" and that he was ""not inclined to offload my responsibility onto others. I believe I've done a useful service for the country."" ""I am taking full responsibility for what we did, which led us to achieve unprecedented results in terms of fighting human trafficking and of saving lives,"" Mr Salvini added. Mr Salvini also said he was ""proud to say that no migrant died at sea while I was minister of the interior"". However, data from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, shows that 926 people died in the central Mediterranean between June 2018 and September 2019, when Mr Salvini was in post. He also told the court that migrant arrivals fell by 90% under the ""closed ports"" policy. While this is corroborated by figures from the Italian interior ministry, it is worth noting that migrant flows are influenced by many factors, such as the political situation in the origin countries of the migrants. During his hour-long spontaneous deposition, Mr Salvini also sought to demonstrate how the entire Italian government at the time - including PM Conte - backed his hard-line approach to immigration. Oscar Camps, the founder of the Open Arms NGO, said that he was hoping the trial ""will bring about justice and that Matteo Salvini will face the consequences of his choices, which were personal"". Mr Salvini faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted in the trial, which began in October 2021.","['Matteo Salvini', 'Italy', 'Migration']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4F69/production/_132292302_gettyimages-1919974116-1.jpg'],"['By Laura Gozzi', 'BBC News']",World,Europe

It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles. Mr Sunak said he was confident allies ""will come together to continue to support Ukraine"". In the US, Republicans are blocking a $60bn (£47bn) package of support for Ukraine in an attempt to increase spending on tackling migration along America's southern border. And in the EU, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has blocked a €50bn (£43bn) support package for Ukraine in a funding row with Brussels.

He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles. Mr Sunak said he was confident allies ""will come together to continue to support Ukraine"". In the US, Republicans are blocking a $60bn (£47bn) package of support for Ukraine in an attempt to increase spending on tackling migration along America's southern border. And in the EU, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has blocked a €50bn (£43bn) support package for Ukraine in a funding row with Brussels.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67958284,Matteo Salvini: Italian deputy PM takes stand in migrant kidnap trial,Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has defended his hard-line approach against illegal migration during a court appearance in Sicily.,2024-01-12,"Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has defended his hard-line approach against illegal migration during a court appearance in Sicily. He is facing kidnap and dereliction of duty charges for preventing migrants from disembarking an NGO ship in 2019. He has denied the charges, saying he acted ""in the interest of national security"". At the time, Mr Salvini - the leader of the right-wing League - was interior minister in a previous government. Ahead of his court appearance, Mr Salvini said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was ""holding his head high, proud of what I did"". In August 2019, a migrant rescue vessel belonging to Spanish NGO Open Arms arrived near Italian shores carrying 147 migrants who had been rescued in the Mediterranean. Mr Salvini - who a year earlier had announced his intention to ""close the ports"" of Italy to NGO rescue ships - immediately signed a decree banning the vessel from entering Italian territorial waters. As a result, the Open Arms remained at sea for almost three weeks. Crewmembers later testified that the migrants' physical and mental wellbeing disintegrated quickly over that period, eventually reaching crisis point due to dire sanitary conditions onboard, including a scabies outbreak. On 20 August, Agrigento Prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio ordered the vessel to be preventatively seized after inspecting it and noting the ""difficult situation on board"". The blockade caused public outcry. Hollywood star Richard Gere visited the Open Arms ship in a show of support and later called upon the Italian government to assist the migrants. Mr Salvini hit back, telling Mr Gere to take the migrants ""back to Hollywood"". Today, Mr Salvini - who is now a partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition - told the court in Sicily's capital of Palermo that he thought ""the situation was not at risk"" onboard the ship. He also said that he had acted ""in full consciousness"" and that he was ""not inclined to offload my responsibility onto others. I believe I've done a useful service for the country."" ""I am taking full responsibility for what we did, which led us to achieve unprecedented results in terms of fighting human trafficking and of saving lives,"" Mr Salvini added. Mr Salvini also said he was ""proud to say that no migrant died at sea while I was minister of the interior"". However, data from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, shows that 926 people died in the central Mediterranean between June 2018 and September 2019, when Mr Salvini was in post. He also told the court that migrant arrivals fell by 90% under the ""closed ports"" policy. While this is corroborated by figures from the Italian interior ministry, it is worth noting that migrant flows are influenced by many factors, such as the political situation in the origin countries of the migrants. During his hour-long spontaneous deposition, Mr Salvini also sought to demonstrate how the entire Italian government at the time - including PM Conte - backed his hard-line approach to immigration. Oscar Camps, the founder of the Open Arms NGO, said that he was hoping the trial ""will bring about justice and that Matteo Salvini will face the consequences of his choices, which were personal"". Mr Salvini faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted in the trial, which began in October 2021.","['Matteo Salvini', 'Italy', 'Migration']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4F69/production/_132292302_gettyimages-1919974116-1.jpg'],"['By Laura Gozzi', 'BBC News']",World,Europe

But his cabinet - named on Thursday - also contains some interesting new faces. Mr Attal's own former partner Stéphane Séjourné is at foreign affairs, while Sarkozy-era minister Rachida Dati is at culture. The cabinet's profile is clearly more skewed to the right than previous ones under President Emmanuel Macron. Gone it seems is the careful preservation of left-right balance.  Today the only members of the government with a past in the Socialist Party (PS) are Mr Attal himself and Mr Séjourné (though Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti also has been identified with the left in the past). Among those who came to Mr Macron from the centre-right Republicans (LR) are Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu - all of whom keep their posts. To their number is now added 58-year-old Rachida Dati, who rose to fame as a young minister of justice under President Sarkozy in 2007. Outspoken and petite, Ms Dati is held up more often than she would like as an exemplar of French Republican integration. One of 11 children born to a Moroccan-Algerian couple in Chalon-sur-Saône, she battled her way to the top by force of personality. Currently she is mayor of the expensive 7th arrondissement of Paris, which includes most government buildings, and which she has used as a springboard for her avowed ambition to be the next mayor of Paris. Political insiders were knocked backwards by news of her appointment at culture, because she was not seen as a particular friend of the government. She once said Macronites were all traitors - either from the left or from the right. Now that she has performed her own mini-betrayal, Ms Dati's membership of LR has been suspended. But her recruitment is a coup for Mr Attal. She is a familiar face among the French who - in general - admire her chutzpah. Less familiar and less exciting a personality,  but occupying a more important role, is Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné. Any thumbnail sketch of the 38-year-old is bound to start with the fact that he was for more than five years the partner of Mr Attal. In 2017, the two Macron-loyalists were joined by a civil partnership (PACS). Mr Attal is France's first openly gay PM. Mr Séjourné attended key meetings at the Elysée while Mr Attal as government spokesman was at the heart of policy-making at the prime minister's office - making them the supreme Macronite power-couple. Such is the importance attached to the non-reporting of public people's private lives in France, it was only this week that we learned that their PACS was dissolved in 2022. Brought up in Madrid and Buenos Aires, Mr Séjourné was an early adopter of Macronism and helped set up the president's LREM party. He was an Elysée adviser before becoming an MEP in 2019 and heading the centrist bloc in the EU parliament, Renew. More than his predecessor Catherine Colonna, he will enjoy the confidence of President Macron - which is as well because it is the president who sets foreign policy anyway. Catherine Vautrin, 63-year-old president of the greater Reims metropolitan area, takes over as a new super-minister of health and labour. She is another defector from the right, having served as a junior minister under President Chirac. Some will recall that Ms Vautrin voted against gay marriage in 2013, though she has since said she regretted not seeing how society was changing. Ms Vautrin is also close to the former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Indeed, there are now three Sarkozy protégés in government: Ms Vautrin, Ms Dati and Mr Darmanin. This has not gone unnoticed.

It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years.

More than his predecessor Catherine Colonna, he will enjoy the confidence of President Macron - which is as well because it is the president who sets foreign policy anyway. Catherine Vautrin, 63-year-old president of the greater Reims metropolitan area, takes over as a new super-minister of health and labour. She is another defector from the right, having served as a junior minister under President Chirac. Some will recall that Ms Vautrin voted against gay marriage in 2013, though she has since said she regretted not seeing how society was changing. Ms Vautrin is also close to the former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Indeed, there are now three Sarkozy protégés in government: Ms Vautrin, Ms Dati and Mr Darmanin. This has not gone unnoticed. It is also well-known that Mr Macron himself and the 68 year-old Sarkozy have a cordial relationship and talk regularly.","['France', 'Emmanuel Macron']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/181F9/production/_132290889_e5f1fa2ff08293f27d3ed50cb59b4263665c8c22-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4979/production/_132290881_dati-sejourne.jpg']","['By Hugh Schofield', 'BBC News, Paris']",World,Europe

It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles. Mr Sunak said he was confident allies ""will come together to continue to support Ukraine"". In the US, Republicans are blocking a $60bn (£47bn) package of support for Ukraine in an attempt to increase spending on tackling migration along America's southern border. And in the EU, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has blocked a €50bn (£43bn) support package for Ukraine in a funding row with Brussels.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67958284,Matteo Salvini: Italian deputy PM takes stand in migrant kidnap trial,Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has defended his hard-line approach against illegal migration during a court appearance in Sicily.,2024-01-12,"Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has defended his hard-line approach against illegal migration during a court appearance in Sicily. He is facing kidnap and dereliction of duty charges for preventing migrants from disembarking an NGO ship in 2019. He has denied the charges, saying he acted ""in the interest of national security"". At the time, Mr Salvini - the leader of the right-wing League - was interior minister in a previous government. Ahead of his court appearance, Mr Salvini said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was ""holding his head high, proud of what I did"". In August 2019, a migrant rescue vessel belonging to Spanish NGO Open Arms arrived near Italian shores carrying 147 migrants who had been rescued in the Mediterranean. Mr Salvini - who a year earlier had announced his intention to ""close the ports"" of Italy to NGO rescue ships - immediately signed a decree banning the vessel from entering Italian territorial waters. As a result, the Open Arms remained at sea for almost three weeks. Crewmembers later testified that the migrants' physical and mental wellbeing disintegrated quickly over that period, eventually reaching crisis point due to dire sanitary conditions onboard, including a scabies outbreak. On 20 August, Agrigento Prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio ordered the vessel to be preventatively seized after inspecting it and noting the ""difficult situation on board"". The blockade caused public outcry. Hollywood star Richard Gere visited the Open Arms ship in a show of support and later called upon the Italian government to assist the migrants. Mr Salvini hit back, telling Mr Gere to take the migrants ""back to Hollywood"". Today, Mr Salvini - who is now a partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition - told the court in Sicily's capital of Palermo that he thought ""the situation was not at risk"" onboard the ship. He also said that he had acted ""in full consciousness"" and that he was ""not inclined to offload my responsibility onto others. I believe I've done a useful service for the country."" ""I am taking full responsibility for what we did, which led us to achieve unprecedented results in terms of fighting human trafficking and of saving lives,"" Mr Salvini added. Mr Salvini also said he was ""proud to say that no migrant died at sea while I was minister of the interior"". However, data from UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, shows that 926 people died in the central Mediterranean between June 2018 and September 2019, when Mr Salvini was in post. He also told the court that migrant arrivals fell by 90% under the ""closed ports"" policy. While this is corroborated by figures from the Italian interior ministry, it is worth noting that migrant flows are influenced by many factors, such as the political situation in the origin countries of the migrants. During his hour-long spontaneous deposition, Mr Salvini also sought to demonstrate how the entire Italian government at the time - including PM Conte - backed his hard-line approach to immigration. Oscar Camps, the founder of the Open Arms NGO, said that he was hoping the trial ""will bring about justice and that Matteo Salvini will face the consequences of his choices, which were personal"". Mr Salvini faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted in the trial, which began in October 2021.","['Matteo Salvini', 'Italy', 'Migration']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4F69/production/_132292302_gettyimages-1919974116-1.jpg'],"['By Laura Gozzi', 'BBC News']",World,Europe

The National Development Plan (NDP) was published in 2018 and updated in 2021. It set out a €165bn (£142bn) programme of infrastructure investment in things like housing, transport and energy. But the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) said the plan ""may have underestimated what is needed"".It added that the challenge now is how to increase investment without fuelling inflation. The government had asked the ESRI to assess what had changed since 2021, which would impact on investment needs and the capacity of the economy to deliver them. The major developments have been a strong economic recovery from the pandemic and rapid population growth, driven by immigration. The ESRI said that means that, for example, ""it is almost certain that existing targets for housing supply understate need, given the stronger than expected increase in the population shown by early results from the 2022 Census"". It added: ""Hence, higher output will be needed.""However, very low unemployment means it will be difficult to grow the construction workforce needed to build all the intended projects. ESRI director Alan Barrett said the Irish government faces a dilemma. ""On the one hand, there is a clear need for investment in public infrastructure as our population and economy grow and our climate targets remain challenging,"" he added. ""However, on the other hand, the economy is operating at full employment, so the resources needed to accelerate the NDP are not readily available.""The ESRI has recommended that the government re-examine the sequencing of projects and potentially prioritise those which have the potential to ease inflationary pressures or which are less labour intensive.",['Republic of Ireland'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/880/cpsprodpb/50c8/live/1ed40b80-b0e0-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg'],"['John Campbell', 'BBC News NI economics and business editor']",World,Europe

Following an inquest, his parents understand he was killed by two gunshots at close range, to the head and torso, and not by tank fire as was initially suspected. Both Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw were helping to evacuate a woman from an area of heavy bombardment in eastern Ukraine when they were killed. Mrs Parry said: ""We don't know who did it, when they did it or even why they did it. ""The best we can hope for is that they recognise it as an unlawful killing. Ideally what we would like is for it to be acknowledged as a war crime but whether that will happen we don't know."" Since his death Mr and Mrs Parry, and their daughter Kate have travelled to Ukraine to deliver vehicles to help those needing to be taken to safety. Mrs Parry said: ""It was so heart warming to do that journey in the same way that Chris would have done it. It was really uplifting. Sad? Yes, but it did feel like a bit of an adventure.""

Ecuador's youngest ever president has only been in the job since November, but he is now faced with the country's biggest crisis in its modern history. Days of unrest saw two gang leaders escape from jail, prison guards held hostage, and explosive devices set off in a number of cities across the country. Then, a day after Mr Noboa declared a state of emergency, armed men burst into the studios of TC television in Guayaquil, threatening staff with guns live on air. Speaking exclusively to the BBC during his first visit to Guayaquil since the violence, the president acknowledged that the task ahead in restoring peace to the country was daunting. ""I didn't sign up for this thinking it was going to be easy,"" he says on the waterfront of the conflicted port city. ""We can't continue with this game that these terrorist groups are trying to establish."" Now, he insists, changes are under way. Since the violence unfolded, he has declared the Andean nation to be in an ""internal armed conflict"" with the powerful drug gangs which control the cocaine smuggling trade. He has ordered his military to ""neutralise"" 22 armed groups which he redefined as terrorist organisations. Now Washington is offering its help. A delegation of US law enforcement, military and diplomatic personnel is due to arrive in Ecuador in the coming weeks. His critics see US interventionism at play but President Noboa applauds the move. ""It's encouraging to see the international community actually paying attention to what's going on here,"" he smiles. ""It affects the whole world: the narco-terrorists that operate here have operations in Europe, in the US."" ""We need to solve the problem from the roots, and the root of the problem is here,"" he adds. There remain some pressing issues following the chaotic and violent scenes. First and foremost, about 180 prison officers are still in the hands of criminal gangs inside several prisons. Their families are growing increasingly desperate and have held protests in the capital, Quito. Given Mr Noboa has said hostage-taking is the ""ugly side of war"" and refuses to negotiate with the gangs, I asked him what his government was doing to secure their release.

We'll do everything in our power to bring those people home."" The other immediate question is over the whereabouts of a notorious drug gang leader, Adolfo Macias Villamar, alias Fito. The escape from prison of the feared head of the Choneros gang earlier this week appeared to spark much of the subsequent violence. President Noboa conceded his forces didn't yet know where he was. ""Right now, we're looking for him. We have a few leads which we're chasing down with the armed forces and with international cooperation."" His government says they intend to search for the fugitive leader - and for Fabricio Colon Pico, the head of an opposing gang who's also on the run - until they're successful. If there is one thing that this week has laid bare, though, it's that Ecuador's problems run deep. The drug gangs, which are believed to operate in tandem with powerful Mexican cartels, are smuggling tonnes of cocaine out of Ecuador's ports, like Guayaquil, to the US and Europe. Detection of the drugs inside the shipping containers is insufficient and President Noboa says he's keen to do more to strengthen checks in the country's ports. With their sizeable profits though, the gangs have been able to corrupt the judicial and political system as well as the prison system. The president says he wants to implement root and branch reform in the coming years.

Matt Hammond and his sister-in-law, Helen Reeson, were visiting Rodney Bay Beach with their family when they spotted the group in the water. Ms Reeson, from East Yorkshire, said: ""I didn't really think about myself, we just knew that we had to get to them. ""Only after do you think we did a good thing, we did save somebody's life."" The group, from Leven, said when they first spotted the women they thought they were waving at them, but when they realised they were in danger Mr Hammond and Ms Reeson ran into the water. ""It took a moment for us to register that they were in trouble,"" Mr Hammond said. ""The lady in the middle was bobbing up and down and taking water on board. ""We got hold of her, we pulled her and swam with her to shore. ""As we got to shore my wife was waiting and she and Helen then took the lady off and the first aid that they administered calmed her down before they sent her on her way and encouraged her to go and see a doctor."" The rescue attracted coverage in the island newspaper, but neither Mr Hammond nor Ms Reeson said they felt they had done anything out of the ordinary. Reflecting on the events Mr Hammond said: ""I don't think you think about anything really, you see somebody in trouble and your natural instinct is that you want to help, and I'd like to think that most people would do the same thing.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67944903,Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide case,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.",2024-01-12,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide. South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ. South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza. It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity. The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case. Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart. On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere. South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening. Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war. In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"". South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"". Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"". He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas. On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"". Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"". ""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"". ""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation."" Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said. What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched. A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.","['South Africa', 'International Court of Justice', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war']",,"['By Raffi Berg in London & Anna Holligan at The Hague', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67955729,Strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen show war in Gaza has already spread,It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened.,2024-01-12,"It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened. Hopes for containing what is happening rest on the fact that it is still relatively low-level, compared to the worst-case scenarios of regional war. The US and British attacks on the Houthis in Yemen are not just, as ministers in London have suggested, about the freedom of navigation and world trade. They are directly linked to events in Gaza and represent an escalation of the crisis that is gripping the region. The Houthis immediately vowed to respond. It is also entirely possible that pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria will increase the action they are taking against the American forces in the region. If that theatre heats up more, and US forces retaliate, it will be harder for the American diplomacy effort to avert all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political movement backed by Iran. The Houthis are also part of the network of allies and proxies, the so-called axis of resistance, that Iran has constructed to give it forward defence against its enemies. They are getting increasingly sophisticated weapons from Iran, but it is best to think of them as allies rather than Tehran's proxy. I have spent quite a bit of time with the Houthis in Yemen and they are people who are highly independently minded. They will relish conflict with the Americans. They want to be part of this war. What has been happening suits both the Houthis and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has beefed up their capabilities and the kind of firepower that the Houthis have at their disposal. That includes anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles they have fired at Israel as well as attack drones - the same sort that Iran supplies to Russia to use against Ukraine. They are well-armed. It is nothing like the naval capacity that they are facing from the US, UK and other members of the coalition the Americans have assembled in the Red Sea. But the threat the Houthis pose is less about the physical damage they might cause and more about the danger to international navigation. In December, they hijacked a ship and forced it into one of their ports. They have also fired directly at ships and caused some damage, although they have not sunk any vessels. Commercial shipping companies who want to get their valuable cargoes through the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait at the mouth of Red Sea do not want to have hostile forces firing at them. Because of the risks, the insurance costs will rocket, and that's why so many companies are now choosing to detour along the west coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, the shortcut between Asia and Europe that routes ships down the Red Sea and through Bab al-Mandab. The Houthis have controlled Sanaa, Yemen's capital, and big parts of the country including the Red Sea coast since 2014. In 2015, Saudi Arabia led a coalition, also including the United Arab Emirates, that went to war to try to overthrow them. The Saudis said the intervention in Yemen's civil war was to re-establish the country's legitimate and internationally recognised government, which the Houthis had overthrown. But a few days after the intervention started, I spoke to very senior Saudis who told me it was to stop Iran from operating in their back yard. Yemen has a frontier with Saudi Arabia. The Houthis were then bombed by the Saudis from 2015 until the ceasefire came in over a year ago, so a fresh round of strikes is unlikely to intimidate them - they are used to it. I don't think one single round of air strikes is going to do more than make them think yes, we are on the right track. They want to be seen as a fearless resistance to America and its Western allies, who also back Israel. The Houthis have said that they are carrying out these attacks in the Red Sea because of the war in Gaza, the killing of civilians and the severe privations Israel has imposed by blocking all but a fraction of the food and relief supplies that they need to survive. They have said that if the war in Gaza ended and if supplies were permitted to enter, then they wouldn't be threatening a major international shipping lane. Some critics of the American and British support for Israel say that an immediate ceasefire in Gaza would be a much better way to stop the Houthi attacks than bombing them. If Houthi attacks continued after a ceasefire, the argument is that air strikes against them would have increased legitimacy. There is the possibility that this US-UK action could prolong or escalate the situation with the Houthis, rather than shutting it down. Last November, when the Houthis made their first moves in the wider Gaza war with their first attacks on merchant shipping off the Yemen coast, I spoke to Mohammed Ali Al Houthi, one of the leading members of their organisation. He was very defiant then and I am absolutely certain the Houthis will continue to be defiant now. They will want to carry out more attacks, to show that they are defiant and unbeaten. The US and UK attacks hit many different locations. While it is not possible to know the Houthis' precise military capacity, it seems unlikely that one round of strikes will have taken it out. Regular bombardment by the Saudis since 2015 did not appear to have had a significant impact on their capacity. Yemen is a mountainous country. Given their experience of being bombed it is likely they will have tried to hide things away. Iran presumably has sent advisers and trainers to Yemen to help them operate the weapons they have supplied, and they too will have thought about ways of surviving attacks. We can gauge the way that Iran has upgraded the Houthi arsenal by looking at the kind of weapons they are firing out of Yemen. They are more sophisticated, more lethal and therefore more of a threat. When the Houthis took over a merchant ship last month, video of their attack showed well-trained commandoes landing from a helicopter. They are more formidable than the images we often see on TV, of groups of raggedly dressed men waving Kalashnikovs. Compared to the force the US and UK can wield there is no comparison, but that isn't the point in this kind of warfare. If the Houthis, who have supporters across the region, are able to continue to threaten and fire on ships in some way then they will signal to their followers that they are not bowed by the West. More retaliation from the US and its allies is certain if the Houthis do not do as they are told.","['United States', 'Jeremy Bowen', 'Houthis', 'Military']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E52C/production/_132286685_b854f176f7971ac71e5d930b53eec812c40d23900_0_5500_36671000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0A80/production/_132288620_yemen_gaza_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E798/production/_132288295_82b9db8aec50a86c8f49a60d1a13ce3b947bdbcf0_147_4385_24661000x563.jpg']","['By Jeremy Bowen', 'BBC international editor']",World,Middle East

According to a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Friday, the medicine will be delivered in the next few days. The statement also said the deal was brokered after David Barnea, director of Israel's national intelligence agency Mossad, approached Qatar. A Palestinian official told the BBC there had been discussions about bringing medical aid into Gaza, part of which covered ""the needs of the Israeli hostages in Gaza"". In a letter sent to the Israeli war cabinet after the ceasefire ended last year, the Hostages Families HQ group said they had ""solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger"". They said at least a third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous.

The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was ""necessary, proportionate, and targeted"" to protect lives and commercial shipping. In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK ""acted in self-defence"" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. ""We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."" He said: ""It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong."" Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes ""immediately planned"". The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route."" Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were ""inevitable"" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. ""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. ""We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said. Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

According to a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Friday, the medicine will be delivered in the next few days. The statement also said the deal was brokered after David Barnea, director of Israel's national intelligence agency Mossad, approached Qatar. A Palestinian official told the BBC there had been discussions about bringing medical aid into Gaza, part of which covered ""the needs of the Israeli hostages in Gaza"". In a letter sent to the Israeli war cabinet after the ceasefire ended last year, the Hostages Families HQ group said they had ""solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger"". They said at least a third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous. Since the 7 October attacks, more than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during retaliatory military action by Israel, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says around 1,300 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attack.","['Gaza', 'Hamas', 'Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Israel']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5103/production/_132293702_mediaitem132293570.jpg'],"['By Natasha Preskey', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954799,"UK and US strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen are self-defence, says Rishi Sunak","The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said.",2024-01-12,"The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said. The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was ""necessary, proportionate, and targeted"" to protect lives and commercial shipping. In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK ""acted in self-defence"" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. ""We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."" He said: ""It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong."" Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes ""immediately planned"". The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route."" Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were ""inevitable"" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. ""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. ""We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said. Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67614911,Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking Red Sea ships?,Drone and rocket attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea have now prompted US and UK-led forces to stage air strikes on targets in the region.,2024-01-12,"Drone and rocket attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea have now prompted US and UK-led forces to stage air strikes on targets in the region. Western forces took action after vessels were attacked by the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel group which controls a large part of Yemen. US President Joe Biden said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes early on Friday against Houthi targets with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. More than 12 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold, were hit. The Houthi targets in Yemen included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots. The attacks began after the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October. The Houthis declared their support for Hamas and said they would target any ship travelling to Israel. It is not clear that all of the ships attacked were actually heading there. In November they seized what they said was an Israeli cargo ship. They since have attacked several commercial vessels with drones and ballistic missiles. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December. Major shipping firms including Mediterranean Shipping Company, Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and the oil company BP have all said they are diverting vessels away from the Red Sea. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. Washington has accused Iran of being ""deeply involved"" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They take their name from the movement's founder, Hussein al Houthi. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the group was formed in the 1990s to combat what they saw as the corruption of the then president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. President Saleh, backed by Saudi Arabia's military, tried to eliminate the Houthi rebels in 2003, but the Houthis repelled them both. The Houthis have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen's government. The government has been backed against the Houthis by a coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. By the start of 2022, the war had caused an estimated 377,000 deaths and displaced four million people, according to the UN. The Houthis declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and the wider West - along with Hamas and Hezbollah. The Houthis model themselves on the Shia armed group in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been providing them with extensive military expertise and training since 2014, according to the US research institute, the Combating Terrorism Center. The Houthis also consider Iran as an ally, because Saudi Arabia is their common enemy. Iran is suspected of supplying the Houthis with weapons, and the US says Iranian intelligence is critical to enabling them to target ships. ""We know that Iran was deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,"" White House national security spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. ""This is consistent with Iran's long-term material support and encouragement of the Houthis' destabilizing actions in the region."" Iran denies involvement in attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea. The US and Saudi Arabia says Iran supplied the ballistic missiles which the Houthis fired at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in 2017, but which were shot down. Saudi Arabia also blamed Iran for supplying the cruise missiles and drones that the Houthis used to attack Saudi oil installations in 2019. The Houthis have fired ten of thousands of short-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, and have also attacked targets in the UAE. They have also fired ballistic missiles and drones towards Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. Supplying these weapons would breach a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied doing so. The official government of Yemen is the Presidential Leadership Council, to which President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi transferred his powers in April 2022. However, the government is based in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, after Hadi fled there in 2015. Most of the Yemeni population lives in areas under Houthi control. As well as Sanaa and the north of Yemen, the Houthis control the Red Sea coastline. The group collects taxes and also prints money. The UN Security Council said that by 2010 the Houthis had between 100,000 and 120,000 followers, made up of armed troops and unarmed supporters.",['Houthis'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1292D/production/_131777067_p0gtwths.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/86D7/production/_132291543_marine_traffic_red_sea_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9E85/production/_131918504_fd1435b1-9887-40ff-88eb-ccb575aa3515.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/22DB/production/_122932980_uaedrone2019gettyimages-978619090.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/130AE/production/_132289977_houthimap.png']",,World,Middle East

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67955729,Strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen show war in Gaza has already spread,It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened.,2024-01-12,"It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened. Hopes for containing what is happening rest on the fact that it is still relatively low-level, compared to the worst-case scenarios of regional war. The US and British attacks on the Houthis in Yemen are not just, as ministers in London have suggested, about the freedom of navigation and world trade. They are directly linked to events in Gaza and represent an escalation of the crisis that is gripping the region. The Houthis immediately vowed to respond. It is also entirely possible that pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria will increase the action they are taking against the American forces in the region. If that theatre heats up more, and US forces retaliate, it will be harder for the American diplomacy effort to avert all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political movement backed by Iran. The Houthis are also part of the network of allies and proxies, the so-called axis of resistance, that Iran has constructed to give it forward defence against its enemies. They are getting increasingly sophisticated weapons from Iran, but it is best to think of them as allies rather than Tehran's proxy. I have spent quite a bit of time with the Houthis in Yemen and they are people who are highly independently minded. They will relish conflict with the Americans. They want to be part of this war. What has been happening suits both the Houthis and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has beefed up their capabilities and the kind of firepower that the Houthis have at their disposal. That includes anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles they have fired at Israel as well as attack drones - the same sort that Iran supplies to Russia to use against Ukraine. They are well-armed. It is nothing like the naval capacity that they are facing from the US, UK and other members of the coalition the Americans have assembled in the Red Sea. But the threat the Houthis pose is less about the physical damage they might cause and more about the danger to international navigation. In December, they hijacked a ship and forced it into one of their ports. They have also fired directly at ships and caused some damage, although they have not sunk any vessels. Commercial shipping companies who want to get their valuable cargoes through the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait at the mouth of Red Sea do not want to have hostile forces firing at them. Because of the risks, the insurance costs will rocket, and that's why so many companies are now choosing to detour along the west coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, the shortcut between Asia and Europe that routes ships down the Red Sea and through Bab al-Mandab. The Houthis have controlled Sanaa, Yemen's capital, and big parts of the country including the Red Sea coast since 2014. In 2015, Saudi Arabia led a coalition, also including the United Arab Emirates, that went to war to try to overthrow them. The Saudis said the intervention in Yemen's civil war was to re-establish the country's legitimate and internationally recognised government, which the Houthis had overthrown. But a few days after the intervention started, I spoke to very senior Saudis who told me it was to stop Iran from operating in their back yard. Yemen has a frontier with Saudi Arabia. The Houthis were then bombed by the Saudis from 2015 until the ceasefire came in over a year ago, so a fresh round of strikes is unlikely to intimidate them - they are used to it. I don't think one single round of air strikes is going to do more than make them think yes, we are on the right track. They want to be seen as a fearless resistance to America and its Western allies, who also back Israel. The Houthis have said that they are carrying out these attacks in the Red Sea because of the war in Gaza, the killing of civilians and the severe privations Israel has imposed by blocking all but a fraction of the food and relief supplies that they need to survive. They have said that if the war in Gaza ended and if supplies were permitted to enter, then they wouldn't be threatening a major international shipping lane. Some critics of the American and British support for Israel say that an immediate ceasefire in Gaza would be a much better way to stop the Houthi attacks than bombing them. If Houthi attacks continued after a ceasefire, the argument is that air strikes against them would have increased legitimacy. There is the possibility that this US-UK action could prolong or escalate the situation with the Houthis, rather than shutting it down. Last November, when the Houthis made their first moves in the wider Gaza war with their first attacks on merchant shipping off the Yemen coast, I spoke to Mohammed Ali Al Houthi, one of the leading members of their organisation. He was very defiant then and I am absolutely certain the Houthis will continue to be defiant now. They will want to carry out more attacks, to show that they are defiant and unbeaten. The US and UK attacks hit many different locations. While it is not possible to know the Houthis' precise military capacity, it seems unlikely that one round of strikes will have taken it out. Regular bombardment by the Saudis since 2015 did not appear to have had a significant impact on their capacity. Yemen is a mountainous country. Given their experience of being bombed it is likely they will have tried to hide things away. Iran presumably has sent advisers and trainers to Yemen to help them operate the weapons they have supplied, and they too will have thought about ways of surviving attacks. We can gauge the way that Iran has upgraded the Houthi arsenal by looking at the kind of weapons they are firing out of Yemen. They are more sophisticated, more lethal and therefore more of a threat. When the Houthis took over a merchant ship last month, video of their attack showed well-trained commandoes landing from a helicopter. They are more formidable than the images we often see on TV, of groups of raggedly dressed men waving Kalashnikovs. Compared to the force the US and UK can wield there is no comparison, but that isn't the point in this kind of warfare. If the Houthis, who have supporters across the region, are able to continue to threaten and fire on ships in some way then they will signal to their followers that they are not bowed by the West. More retaliation from the US and its allies is certain if the Houthis do not do as they are told.","['United States', 'Jeremy Bowen', 'Houthis', 'Military']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E52C/production/_132286685_b854f176f7971ac71e5d930b53eec812c40d23900_0_5500_36671000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0A80/production/_132288620_yemen_gaza_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E798/production/_132288295_82b9db8aec50a86c8f49a60d1a13ce3b947bdbcf0_147_4385_24661000x563.jpg']","['By Jeremy Bowen', 'BBC international editor']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67944903,Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide case,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.",2024-01-12,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide. South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ. South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza. It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity. The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case. Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart. On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere. South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening. Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war. In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"". South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"". Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"". He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas. On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"". Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"". ""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"". ""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation."" Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said. What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched. A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.","['South Africa', 'International Court of Justice', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war']",,"['By Raffi Berg in London & Anna Holligan at The Hague', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

It comes after some hostage's families visited Qatar and told mediators loved ones needed important prescription medication, CBS News reports. Deliveries have not begun yet, and it is not clear how medicine will be transported. Israel believes there are around 105 hostages still alive in Gaza. An estimated 240 people were taken prisoner in Hamas's 7 October attacks, but 105 were later released by Hamas during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, and at least 25 are believed to be dead. Both Hamas and Israel have shown willingness to allow the medicines to reach hostages, reports the BBC's international partner, CBS News, quoting a diplomatic source. Mediators are working with the two sides and with international NGOs to understand which medications are needed, how many, and how they can be delivered, the source adds. According to a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Friday, the medicine will be delivered in the next few days. The statement also said the deal was brokered after David Barnea, director of Israel's national intelligence agency Mossad, approached Qatar. A Palestinian official told the BBC there had been discussions about bringing medical aid into Gaza, part of which covered ""the needs of the Israeli hostages in Gaza"". In a letter sent to the Israeli war cabinet after the ceasefire ended last year, the Hostages Families HQ group said they had ""solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger"". They said at least a third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous. Since the 7 October attacks, more than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during retaliatory military action by Israel, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says around 1,300 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attack.","['Gaza', 'Hamas', 'Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Israel']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5103/production/_132293702_mediaitem132293570.jpg'],"['By Natasha Preskey', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67614911,Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking Red Sea ships?,Drone and rocket attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea have now prompted US and UK-led forces to stage air strikes on targets in the region.,2024-01-12,"Drone and rocket attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea have now prompted US and UK-led forces to stage air strikes on targets in the region. Western forces took action after vessels were attacked by the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel group which controls a large part of Yemen. US President Joe Biden said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes early on Friday against Houthi targets with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. More than 12 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold, were hit. The Houthi targets in Yemen included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots. The attacks began after the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October. The Houthis declared their support for Hamas and said they would target any ship travelling to Israel. It is not clear that all of the ships attacked were actually heading there. In November they seized what they said was an Israeli cargo ship. They since have attacked several commercial vessels with drones and ballistic missiles. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December. Major shipping firms including Mediterranean Shipping Company, Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd and the oil company BP have all said they are diverting vessels away from the Red Sea. The fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. Almost 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez canal and is the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. Washington has accused Iran of being ""deeply involved"" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They take their name from the movement's founder, Hussein al Houthi. Formally known as the Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the group was formed in the 1990s to combat what they saw as the corruption of the then president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. President Saleh, backed by Saudi Arabia's military, tried to eliminate the Houthi rebels in 2003, but the Houthis repelled them both. The Houthis have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen's government. The government has been backed against the Houthis by a coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. By the start of 2022, the war had caused an estimated 377,000 deaths and displaced four million people, according to the UN. The Houthis declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and the wider West - along with Hamas and Hezbollah. The Houthis model themselves on the Shia armed group in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been providing them with extensive military expertise and training since 2014, according to the US research institute, the Combating Terrorism Center. The Houthis also consider Iran as an ally, because Saudi Arabia is their common enemy. Iran is suspected of supplying the Houthis with weapons, and the US says Iranian intelligence is critical to enabling them to target ships. ""We know that Iran was deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,"" White House national security spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. ""This is consistent with Iran's long-term material support and encouragement of the Houthis' destabilizing actions in the region."" Iran denies involvement in attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea. The US and Saudi Arabia says Iran supplied the ballistic missiles which the Houthis fired at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in 2017, but which were shot down. Saudi Arabia also blamed Iran for supplying the cruise missiles and drones that the Houthis used to attack Saudi oil installations in 2019. The Houthis have fired ten of thousands of short-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, and have also attacked targets in the UAE. They have also fired ballistic missiles and drones towards Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. Supplying these weapons would breach a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied doing so. The official government of Yemen is the Presidential Leadership Council, to which President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi transferred his powers in April 2022. However, the government is based in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, after Hadi fled there in 2015. Most of the Yemeni population lives in areas under Houthi control. As well as Sanaa and the north of Yemen, the Houthis control the Red Sea coastline. The group collects taxes and also prints money. The UN Security Council said that by 2010 the Houthis had between 100,000 and 120,000 followers, made up of armed troops and unarmed supporters.",['Houthis'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1292D/production/_131777067_p0gtwths.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/86D7/production/_132291543_marine_traffic_red_sea_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9E85/production/_131918504_fd1435b1-9887-40ff-88eb-ccb575aa3515.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/22DB/production/_122932980_uaedrone2019gettyimages-978619090.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/130AE/production/_132289977_houthimap.png']",,World,Middle East

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-12,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations' top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide. But its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""This legal action does not serve the court of peace. The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. ""Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa. ""As a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, discrimination, racism and state-sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the right side of history.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67955727,What we know about strikes on Houthis and strategy behind them,The US and UK have carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen with the aim of deterring attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea.,2024-01-12,"The US and UK have carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen with the aim of deterring attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea. The strikes were also backed by a number of the US and UK's allies. Missiles were launched overnight into Friday, hitting dozens of sites - with some casualties reported. The Houthis say they are not deterred by the attacks, but the US suggests the strikes have damaged the rebel group's military capability. But the group has survived much worse - including years of being targeted by the Saudi Air Force. This is what we know about the US-UK strikes so far. The US says it ""executed deliberate strikes on over 60 targets at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations"". The Pentagon described its targets as radar systems, drone storage and launch sites, missile storage and launch facilities and Houthi command and control nodes. Strikes were reported in the Yemen capital Sanaa - which is controlled by the rebels - as well as the Houthi Red Sea port of Hodeidah, Dhamar and the group's north-western stronghold of Saada. According to the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD), the British strikes were in Bani in the north-west - which the MoD said was a drone operational site - and Abbs airfield, which intelligence said was a launching site for missiles and drones. There were 72 strikes in all, according to the Houthis' military spokesman. The Houthi spokesman also said five of its members had been killed and six others injured. The Pentagon said the strikes were on military, not civilian targets using ""precision weapons"". US President Joe Biden has said he won't hesitate to take further military action if necessary. But the US has also made clear that it does not want to see a widening conflict in the Middle East. That suggests that any future US-led military action, if necessary, would again be limited. Air strikes and long range cruise missiles are the least risky and costly for Mr Biden in an election year. Remember the US has been also using limited airstrikes to target other Iranian backed groups in Iraq and Syria in recent months. But at best it's a deterrent. It will not eliminate the threat. The strikes last night might also have degraded and destroyed some of the Houthi's ability to launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. But in public, at least, they remain defiant. They still have the capacity to launch further attacks. The only real option left for the US and UK is then doing more of the same - targeting from a distance. The US has bitter recent experience of more direct military action in the region -  such as putting boots on the ground. The bulk of the firepower came from US jets. The US has an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, as well as air bases in the region. US Navy warships fired Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, which are GPS-guided and can be programmed to fly evasively, the US military says. While no specific figures have been given for how many missiles were fired, the US says more than 100 precision-guided munitions ""of various types"" were used. Meanwhile, the UK said it sent four RAF Typhoons from Cyprus, carrying Paveway IV guided bombs. It has not said how many were released. Though the Royal Navy has two warships in the Red Sea, neither can fire land attack missiles and so would not have been directly involved in the strikes. Reacting to Friday's strikes, the group's leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said the US and UK would ""soon realise"" the action was ""the greatest folly in their history"". ""America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences,"" he wrote on social media, adding ""every individual in this world is faced with two choices - either to stand with the victims of genocide or to stand with its perpetrators."" Another spokesman for the group said the US and UK were wrong to think they could deter Yemen's support for Palestinians. Iran, which backs the Houthis, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a ""clear violation of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and a violation of international laws. A US senior administration official at the National Security Council said in a call on Thursday that ""Iran is a primary, if not the primary enabler or supporter sponsor of the Houthis"", adding that they believe Iran has been ""involved in every phase"" of these attacks. The Houthis' position on the Red Sea attacks is that they are preventing ships affiliated with Israel from crossing the route - due to events in Gaza. They have previously said that any ship destined for Israel or with Israeli links is a ""legitimate target"". However, many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection. ""They are firing indiscriminately on vessels with global ties,"" the US National Security Council official said. ""Most of the ships that have come under attack have nothing whatsoever to do with Israel."" Mr Biden said the strikes were in ""direct response"" to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. ""These attacks have endangered US personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardised trade, and threatened freedom of navigation,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak added that the action was ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect global shipping. ""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week,"" he said. ""This cannot stand."" The US-UK attacks were backed by a coalition of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67962302,South Africa's genocide case against Israel: Both sides play heavy on emotion in ICJ hearing,"The UN's top legal body has now heard two days of powerful legal argument on the ""crime of all crimes"": genocide.",2024-01-12,"The UN's top legal body has now heard two days of powerful legal argument on the ""crime of all crimes"": genocide. It is now for the judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to decide whether Israel, in its war in Gaza, is guilty of an attempt to ""destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part,"" as defined by the 1948 Convention on Genocide. There could hardly be a more weighty matter. Both sides have played heavily on the strong emotions swirling around the conflict that erupted on 7 October last year. Around 1,300 people - most of them civilians - were killed and about 240 others were taken hostage during the Hamas attack on southern Israel. More than 23,350 people have been killed - mostly children and women - during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The case, brought to the ICJ by South Africa, included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure. ""This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life,"" said one of South Africa's lawyers, Adila Hassin. Israel's war in Gaza could not be allowed to continue, the South African team argued. ""Entire multi-generational families will be obliterated,"" Irish barrister Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh warned, ""and yet more Palestinian children will become WCNSF - Wounded Child No Surviving Family - the terrible new acronym borne out of Israel's genocidal assault."" But on Friday morning Israel hit back, with a mixture of its own emotion and a forensic assault on the South African case. Images of 132 missing Israelis - most of them still being held hostage in Gaza - were shown to the court. ""Is there a reason these people on your screen are unworthy of protection,"" Tal Becker, a hugely experienced legal adviser at Israel's Foreign Ministry, asked the court. Mr Becker and his colleagues were scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas. ""Under the guise of the allegation against Israel of genocide,"" Mr Becker said, ""this court is asked to call for an end to operations against the ongoing attacks of an organisation that pursues an actual genocidal agenda"". South Africa, the Israelis said, is guilty of supporting Hamas, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by 41 countries, including the US, EU and UK. During his speech, Professor Malcolm Shaw briefly seemed to imply that the very country bringing this case against Israel was itself complicit. ""South Africa has given succour and support to Hamas, at least,"" he said. It will probably take the ICJ several years to reach its verdict on the charge of genocide. The South Africans must know there's a legal mountain to climb to prove their case. Genocide is notoriously difficult to prove. There needs to be compelling evidence of intent by those actually in charge of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, as well as a pattern of behaviour by the Israel Defense Forces that cannot reasonably be explained as anything other than genocidal. Remember: this is only about genocide, not whether war crimes have been committed in Gaza, or even whether Israel is engaged in ethnic cleansing, as some allege. It's one thing to be horrified, even enraged, by countless images of the suffering inflicted on the Palestinians. It's quite another to conclude that the killing of 1% of the Gazan population, sobering though that number is, represents an Israeli effort to destroy the Palestinian people, ""in whole or in part"". But for Israel, which may feel it's on safe ground when it comes to the ""crime of all crimes"", there's a more immediate concern. South Africa has appealed to the ICJ to issue nine ""provisional measures"", designed, in the words of South Africa's 84-page submission, ""to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people"". The first of these calls on Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operation in and against Gaza"". If obeyed, it would have the effect of bringing Israel's military campaign to a halt. This could happen within weeks, long before Israel feels it has achieved its military objective of utterly destroying Hamas as a political and military force in Gaza. For this reason, its lawyers attempted to demolish South Africa's case for ""provisional measures"", arguing that they had no legal basis and would tie Israel's hands but leave Hamas free to act. Israel doesn't like the ICJ, and feels that the UN as a whole is inherently biased against the Jewish state. But at a time when international pressure is mounting on Israel to put an end to the huge level of violence in Gaza, it knows that if the court agrees to issue provisional measures, that pressure will only increase. It's prepared to ignore the court if it feels it has to (and the ICJ has no powers of enforcement), but it would much prefer to win the legal argument.","['International Court of Justice', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8DF3/production/_132293363_63ba5294e6a05f689038f1751d01372e0c7e3b22.jpg'],"['By Paul Adams', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

It comes after some hostage's families visited Qatar and told mediators loved ones needed important prescription medication, CBS News reports. Deliveries have not begun yet, and it is not clear how medicine will be transported. Israel believes there are around 105 hostages still alive in Gaza. An estimated 240 people were taken prisoner in Hamas's 7 October attacks, but 105 were later released by Hamas during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, and at least 25 are believed to be dead. Both Hamas and Israel have shown willingness to allow the medicines to reach hostages, reports the BBC's international partner, CBS News, quoting a diplomatic source. Mediators are working with the two sides and with international NGOs to understand which medications are needed, how many, and how they can be delivered, the source adds. According to a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office on Friday, the medicine will be delivered in the next few days. The statement also said the deal was brokered after David Barnea, director of Israel's national intelligence agency Mossad, approached Qatar. A Palestinian official told the BBC there had been discussions about bringing medical aid into Gaza, part of which covered ""the needs of the Israeli hostages in Gaza"". In a letter sent to the Israeli war cabinet after the ceasefire ended last year, the Hostages Families HQ group said they had ""solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger"". They said at least a third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous. Since the 7 October attacks, more than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during retaliatory military action by Israel, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ. South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza. It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity. The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case. Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart. On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere. South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening. Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,300 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war. In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"". South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"". Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"". He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas. On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"". Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"". ""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"". ""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation."" Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said. What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched. A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.","['South Africa', 'International Court of Justice', 'Middle East', 'Israel-Gaza war']",,"['By Raffi Berg in London & Anna Holligan at The Hague', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

The UK and US strikes against Houthi rebel sites have been described by Rishi Sunak as ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect the global shipping in the Red Sea. The targeted strikes on military facilities took place overnight. Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let there be no equivocation that the SNP align ourselves with the UN security resolution, which is essentially calling for the Houthi rebels to stop their attacks in the Red Sea. ""But of course the UK's record on military intervention, particularly in the Middle East, is not a good one. ""Before action was taken, the correct and appropriate thing to have done would have been to have recalled parliament, who have given serious detail about any proposed military action."" He added: ""There are significant questions around the action taken. What is the end goal? What will be deemed as a success?"" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the strikes against the Iranian-backed group, who he accuses of threatening UK ships, was in ""self-defence"". In response, Houthi officials have warned that the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year. The Houthis control much of Yemen and say they are supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Mr Sunak accused the Houthi rebels of threatening UK and international ships and causing major disruption to the trade route. ""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week, "" the prime minister said. ""This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade."" The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, has confirmed her sister-in-law and her four children had escaped Gaza. Her brother is a doctor at Al-Nassar Hospital. He is still in the territory with other relatives. Ms El-Nakla's parents returned to Scotland in November after being trapped in Gaza for four weeks when the war with Israel broke out during a family visit. In a statement she said: ""I'm pleased that my sister-in-law, Doaa, and their four children have escaped from Gaza, and are now safe. ""However, my brother Mohamed remains there along with my 93-year-old grandmother and many wider family members."" Ms El Nakla, who is a Dundee councillor, said families in Gaza were ""still suffering after the loss of entirely innocent men, women and children"". She urged the UK government to launch a resettlement scheme for Palestinians, similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa. She added: ""I will continue to raise my voice to stop the killing and suffering of the innocent people of Gaza, and call for an immediate and urgent ceasefire."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""Over 300 British nationals and their dependants have so far left Gaza, and we are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave. ""We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing as required to provide consular assistance. ""Any dependants of British citizens who need a visa can apply for one.

The US and UK launched dozens of airstrikes on Friday - targeting nearly 30 Houthi positions in response to recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Five people were killed, the group reported - vowing to retaliate. Mr Biden said the strikes were a success and that he thought the Houthis were a ""terrorist"" group. Some 73 missiles were launched at Yemen during the strike, the Houthis reported. They said the attack meant UK and US interests were now legitimate targets. ""They [US and UK] committed an idiocy with this treacherous aggression,"" said Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam. ""We're not interested in a war with Yemen,"" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby. However, he added that Mr Biden ""won't hesitate to take further action to protect our troops and our facilities and international commerce"". Friday's attacks had the backing of US-UK allies including Canada and Australia. According to the Pentagon, the group may currently not have the ability to mount a significant military response. ""We did see one anti-ship ballistic missile that was fired today that did not hit any ships of any kind,"" said Director of Operations Lt Gen Douglas A Sims ll. Earlier, there were reports from a UK maritime security group that a missile was fired at a vessel off the southern coast of Yemen but no damage or injury was reported. The British maritime security firm Ambrey said it was a tanker carrying Russian oil that was wrongly targeted by the Houthis, who thought the vessel had a UK connection. But the US has made it clear they believe Iran - a Houthi ally - is pulling the strings and providing the group with the resources it needs to carry out the Red Sea attacks. Tehran, for its part, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a violation of international laws. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak denied Friday's strikes were excessive - a claim levelled by Tukey, who accused the two countries of trying to turn the Red Sea into a ""sea of blood"". Both Mr Sunak and Mr Biden faced criticism that their legislatures were not fully consulted before the attacks were launched. With tensions high over the possibility that the strikes could further destabilise the Middle East, both the UK and US are keen to stress that the airstrikes were simply to protect shipping routes and nothing to do with the Israel-Gaza conflict. The countries have backed Israel following the 7 October attacks by Hamas in which about 1,300 died and some 240 people were taken hostage. The Houthis support Hamas, which is the focus of a military campaign by Israel in Gaza that has seen 23,350 people die so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. In response to the outbreak of war, the Houthis began attacking ships they said were destined for Israel or with Israeli links, describing them as a ""legitimate target"". Some 27 ships have been targeted in the Red Sea to date, according to the Pentagon, but many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection. The threat posed by the Houthis has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December. In the Yemeni capital Sanaa - which is under Houthi control - there were mass demonstrations against the US-UK strikes. ""This rally is first to condemn this aggression against the Republic of Yemen last night,"" one man told the Reuters news agency. ""It is also a message to Britain and the United States of America in particular, that they will pay a heavy price for this aggression."" There have been regular mass rallies in Yemen in support of the Palestinians and Gaza since October but this Friday's were exceptionally large. The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" - along with the Hamas and Hezbollah groups - against Israel, the US and the wider West. They control a large swathe of north-western Yemen - including the country's largest city, Sana'a - and have effectively become the de-facto government there after seizing control in 2014. There is a whole spectrum of possible scenarios which could now develop in the Red Sea, ranging from the optimistic to the catastrophic. Best case: tempers cool, the Houthis have second thoughts and refrain from attacking any more shipping. This is unlikely. Today's mass demo shows they have massive popular support at home and they have already issued defiant warnings of retaliation. Worst case: the Houthis continue targeting shipping and also make good on their promise to attack US/UK assets and manage to score a direct missile hit on a warship. This is a militia that has spent years resisting devastating airstrikes by the Saudi Air Force and is now, thanks in part to help from Iran, more firmly in control of much of Yemen than ever. The Houthis think they are invincible. They certainly have patience and an abundance of weaponry, much of it hidden in mountain tunnels. There is now a dangerous inflection point for the US-led coalition in the Red Sea whereby it risks getting sucked into a costly and unwinnable war, just as the Saudis did.","['United States', 'Yemen', 'Houthis', 'Middle East']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9856/production/_132289983_sanaa3.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5685/production/_132294122_houthimap.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9436/production/_112924973__108893488_frankgardner_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg']",,World,Middle East

The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route.""

""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

The strikes were also backed by a number of the US and UK's allies. Missiles were launched overnight into Friday, hitting dozens of sites - with some casualties reported. The Houthis say they are not deterred by the attacks, but the US suggests the strikes have damaged the rebel group's military capability. But the group has survived much worse - including years of being targeted by the Saudi Air Force. This is what we know about the US-UK strikes so far. The US says it ""executed deliberate strikes on over 60 targets at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations"". The Pentagon described its targets as radar systems, drone storage and launch sites, missile storage and launch facilities and Houthi command and control nodes. Strikes were reported in the Yemen capital Sanaa - which is controlled by the rebels - as well as the Houthi Red Sea port of Hodeidah, Dhamar and the group's north-western stronghold of Saada. According to the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD), the British strikes were in Bani in the north-west - which the MoD said was a drone operational site - and Abbs airfield, which intelligence said was a launching site for missiles and drones. There were 72 strikes in all, according to the Houthis' military spokesman. The Houthi spokesman also said five of its members had been killed and six others injured. The Pentagon said the strikes were on military, not civilian targets using ""precision weapons"". US President Joe Biden has said he won't hesitate to take further military action if necessary. But the US has also made clear that it does not want to see a widening conflict in the Middle East. That suggests that any future US-led military action, if necessary, would again be limited. Air strikes and long range cruise missiles are the least risky and costly for Mr Biden in an election year. Remember the US has been also using limited airstrikes to target other Iranian backed groups in Iraq and Syria in recent months. But at best it's a deterrent. It will not eliminate the threat. The strikes last night might also have degraded and destroyed some of the Houthi's ability to launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. But in public, at least, they remain defiant. They still have the capacity to launch further attacks. The only real option left for the US and UK is then doing more of the same - targeting from a distance. The US has bitter recent experience of more direct military action in the region -  such as putting boots on the ground. The bulk of the firepower came from US jets. The US has an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, as well as air bases in the region. US Navy warships fired Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, which are GPS-guided and can be programmed to fly evasively, the US military says. While no specific figures have been given for how many missiles were fired, the US says more than 100 precision-guided munitions ""of various types"" were used. Meanwhile, the UK said it sent four RAF Typhoons from Cyprus, carrying Paveway IV guided bombs. It has not said how many were released. Though the Royal Navy has two warships in the Red Sea, neither can fire land attack missiles and so would not have been directly involved in the strikes. Reacting to Friday's strikes, the group's leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said the US and UK would ""soon realise"" the action was ""the greatest folly in their history"". ""America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences,"" he wrote on social media, adding ""every individual in this world is faced with two choices - either to stand with the victims of genocide or to stand with its perpetrators."" Another spokesman for the group said the US and UK were wrong to think they could deter Yemen's support for Palestinians. Iran, which backs the Houthis, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a ""clear violation of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and a violation of international laws. A US senior administration official at the National Security Council said in a call on Thursday that ""Iran is a primary, if not the primary enabler or supporter sponsor of the Houthis"", adding that they believe Iran has been ""involved in every phase"" of these attacks. The Houthis' position on the Red Sea attacks is that they are preventing ships affiliated with Israel from crossing the route - due to events in Gaza. They have previously said that any ship destined for Israel or with Israeli links is a ""legitimate target"". However, many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection. ""They are firing indiscriminately on vessels with global ties,"" the US National Security Council official said. ""Most of the ships that have come under attack have nothing whatsoever to do with Israel."" Mr Biden said the strikes were in ""direct response"" to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. ""These attacks have endangered US personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardised trade, and threatened freedom of navigation,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak added that the action was ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect global shipping. ""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week,"" he said. ""This cannot stand."" The US-UK attacks were backed by a coalition of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea. The National Security Council official said ""close calls"", one which recently nearly sunk a ship carrying US jet fuel, has caused ""over a dozen shipping companies"" to reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing costs and affecting the global economy. In a statement, the allies said the multilateral strikes were conducted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence"". ""These precision strikes were intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of international mariners in one of the world's most critical waterways,"" the statement read.","['Yemen', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Military', 'United States', 'Houthis']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0A80/production/_132288620_yemen_gaza_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C86D/production/_132290315_strikes_in_yemen_v2_640-nc-2x-nc.png']","['By Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent, and Jacqueline Howard', 'BBC News']",World,Middle East

They argued, with support from some Republicans, that President Joe Biden violated the US Constitution by not seeking congressional approval first. But several Republicans offered rare praise of the administration, calling it an ""overdue"" act of deterrence. The president on Thursday called the precision strikes a ""defensive action"". In a joint statement with coalition partners - the UK, Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands - the White House said it had acted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter"". Though Mr Biden notified Congress prior to the strikes launched on 16 Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, he did not seek its authorisation. Several progressives in the president's party fumed that his actions violated Article I of the Constitution, which requires that the power to declare war be granted by Congress. ""This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution,"" Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict,"" said California Congressman Ro Khanna. ""I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House."" ""The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians,"" added Missouri's Cori Bush. ""Stop the bombing and do better by us."" Even some Republicans added their voice of disapproval. ""I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?"" asked Rep Chip Roy of Texas. US presidents, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, have often carried out strikes without first seeking congressional approval. After Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani, Mr Biden argued that presidents ""should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people"". But under the Biden administration, the US military has previously launched strikes in Syria and Iraq without going to Congress. Experts say the legal justification lies with the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution passed by Congress in 2001, which the US has used to justify various troop deployments and counter-terrorism operations around the world over the past two decades. Even without the AUMF resolution in effect, some have argued another piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, grants a president broad powers to take military action. Despite the criticism from some elements of Congress, top Republicans and Democrats have backed Mr Biden's decision. ""I welcome the US and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday night. ""President Biden's decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue,"" the top Republican added. Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, agreed. ""I support President Biden's decision to take precise action against these increasingly dangerous provocations that have threatened the interests of the US and our allies, and welcome our coalition partners taking these actions with us,"" Mr Cardin said. Senior administration officials have made clear that an attack on an American commercial vessel, being escorted by US military vessels on Tuesday, was the tipping point for Thursday night's action. Twenty drones and three missiles were shot down and, had that not happened, officials say the ships could have been sunk, including one that was carrying jet fuel. The fact that this action was clearly telegraphed in both Washington and London is a clear indication that the US and UK governments, along with the other members of what officials in Washington DC call ""a coalition of the willing"" wanted to minimise any collateral damage and loss of life: degrading facilities and capabilities was, they say, their aim. The Pentagon is expected to give further details of the battle damage assessment in the coming hours and days, but one senior administration official said indications were that they had had ""good effects"". The concern in Washington has always been the escalation of the Gaza conflict to the wider region, and officials continue to stress that this is their key aim. But they are also acutely aware of the potential commercial damage to the world economy should shipping continue to come under fire in the route through the Red Sea and the Suez canal. In his statement on Thursday, Mr Biden said he ""will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary"".","['Iran-US relations', 'Yemen', 'Joe Biden', 'United States', 'Houthis']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EDC/production/_132288102_gettyimages-1556765674.jpg'],"[""By Sam Cabral and Gary O'Donoghue"", 'BBC News, Washington']",World,Middle East

The Treasury has modelled scenarios suggesting that disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the UK economy, risking a recession. The main fear in the Treasury's analyses is of a rise of at least $10 per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas. Rises such as these have not actually materialised, so far, mainly because of the actions of Saudi Arabia - the major oil producing nation - in soothing global energy markets with price cuts. The US and UK will hope that their overnight strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels will help reverse widespread delays and disruption to Red Sea trading routes, by re-establishing safe passage through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait into the Suez Canal. But, on the other hand, there is now also a clear pathway of escalation to a wider Middle East conflict. Oil prices had fallen quite significantly before this, helping petrol prices drop below £1.40 a litre to a two-year low. And on Friday, while prices rose by 4%, they are still a relatively manageable $80 per barrel. But disruption to cargo traffic risks spreading from the Red Sea across the Arabian Peninsula to the Strait of Hormuz, another key trading route. On Thursday, Iran's navy seized a US-linked oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman as part of a long-running row between the two nations. If that situation also escalates, another energy shock is possible with the risk of $100 per barrel of oil on the horizon - just as the impact of the Ukraine crisis was fading. Meanwhile, Europe is now much more physically dependent on flows of shipped gas from Qatar, after supplies from Russian pipelines were stopped. European energy majors have been queuing up to do deals with Doha after Russian taps were turned off. Even if physical supplies could be made up from the US - now the world largest exporter of liquified natural gas - the price would surge on any disruption in the Gulf. A serious escalation could further disrupt the global economy, entrenching inflation, just as the world's central banks were pondering turning points and cutting interest rates. It would also mark clear parallels with the 1970s, when two separate geopolitical energy shocks from the Arab-Israeli War and the Iranian Revolution led to prolonged inflation over several years. So action taken to protect the world economy, is even on that basis alone, not without its risks.","['Suez canal', 'Yemen crisis', 'Yemen', 'Oil']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AA59/production/_132290634_tankernew.png'],,World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67956770,Rishi Sunak faces call for MP vote on Houthi air strike,"Rishi Sunak is facing calls for a vote on RAF air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, amid concerns over escalation in the Middle East.",2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak is facing calls for a vote on RAF air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, amid concerns over escalation in the Middle East. Downing Street briefed Sir Keir Starmer and Commons' Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle shortly before air strikes began on Thursday evening. Parliament had already risen for the weekend. The Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru have urged it to be recalled to hold a vote on the military action. Downing Street has said there are ""no plans for a retrospective vote"" as parliamentary approval is not required for military action. Commons votes have been held on most armed interventions since the 2003 Iraq war, but constitutionally only the prime minister can authorise strikes. Overnight on Thursday, a US-led air strike hit more than 70 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Houthis say five of their members were killed and six others injured. The action was the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year. The airstrike will not go without ""punishment or retaliation"", the group's leadership have warned. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was ""fully supportive"" of the military action aimed at preventing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. ""I want the prime minister to make a statement as soon as possible, but the principle of taking action against the Houthi rebels is really important,"" he added. But Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that the UK and US action could set ""the region alight"". Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, described the strikes as ""a reckless act of escalation"" and said it ""is utterly disgraceful that Parliament has not even been consulted"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he had ""made representations"" to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden who gave the briefing on Thursday evening, for the Commons ""to be informed at the earliest possible opportunity"" about the military action. He said he was ""happy to facilitate a recall at any time"". Scotland's First Minister, and SNP leader, Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action, lending his support for the Westminster parliament to be recalled. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is ""minded to approve"" military action in the Yemen but he says it's a matter of principle that the government should seek the approval of parliament. The party is demanding a recall, saying MPs should not be ""by-passed"". ""When it comes to military action and putting military people on the frontline, it is important that MPs take that incredibly seriously and have that debate,"" the party's foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said. MPs must hear the government's reasoning for the strikes and contingency plans for retaliatory measures because ""this could well not be the end of it"", she added. The prime minister has said he will make a Commons statement on Monday - after he returns from a visit to Ukraine, but a vote is thought to be unlikely. Asked why he had not recalled Parliament ahead of the military action, Mr Sunak argued the action taken was ""limited and necessary"". He accused the Houthis of acting ""with impunity"", and said their behaviour needed to be responded to with a ""strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong"". In an effort to reassure MPs, Mr Sunak has published a summary of the legal advice which underpinned the military action. Government lawyers said the strikes were legally taken to ""downgrade the Houthi's capabilities and deter further attacks"". While there is no suggestion that further action is imminent, the BBC understands if another intervention does become necessary, new legal advice will have to be sought. Ministers have told the BBC that the timing of the strikes could not be determined by the UK government alone, as this was a US-led operation. It is likely we will hear calls for a parliamentary vote in advance of any further action - should any be deemed necessary - when MPs meet on Monday. The House of Commons Library suggests that, on the basis of recent military operations, prior approval is now required when military action is taken. But the Institute for Government think tank points out the guidance is ""far from clear cut"". So, what are the rules?

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67922346,What is South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ?,The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.,2024-01-12,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is being asked to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. South Africa brought the case to the court. Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"". The ICJ is the United Nations' top court. Based in the Hague, in the Netherlands, it was established after World War Two, to settle disputes between states and give advisory opinions on legal matters, which is what it is being asked to do with Israel. Unlike the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICJ cannot prosecute individuals for crimes of the utmost severity, such as genocide. But its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international institutions. South Africa alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attack. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, killing 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Since Israel launched its military campaign against Hamas in response, more than 23,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. And evidence submitted by South Africa claims ""acts and omissions"" by Israel ""are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"". This refers both to what Israel is actively doing, such as carrying out air strikes, and what it is allegedly failing to do, such as, according to South Africa, preventing harm to civilians. And the case highlights Israeli public rhetoric, including comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of ""genocidal intent"". Under international law, genocide is defined as committing one or more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Those acts are: Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel has fiercely rejected South Africa's claim. Mr Netanyahu said: ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas. ""It would murder all of us if it could. ""In contrast, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is acting as morally as possible."" Israel's military says it takes a raft of measures to avoid civilian casualties. These have included: And the Israeli government has repeatedly stated its intention is to destroy Hamas, not the Palestinian people. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong."" ""This legal action does not serve the court of peace. The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law."" South Africa wants the ICJ to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza"". But it is virtually certain Israel would disregard such an order and could not be made to comply. Rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but in practice, unenforceable. In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend military operations"" in Ukraine - but the order was ignored. The ICJ could rule quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign. This would, in theory, protect the Palestinians from what might ultimately be declared genocide. But a final ruling on whether Israel is committing genocide could take several years. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. And as a signatory to the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention, it has an obligation to act, it says. The governing African National Congress also has a long history of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. ""Our opposition to the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza has driven us as a country to approach the ICJ,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa. ""As a people who once tasted the bitter fruits of dispossession, discrimination, racism and state-sponsored violence, we are clear that we will stand on the right side of history.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67759593,What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?,Global supply chains are facing severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea.,2024-01-12,"Global supply chains are facing severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea. Attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen on commercial vessels have resulted in many firms deciding to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, though it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen in response to the attacks on shipping. The Houthis have been stepping up their attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The group, which is backed by Iran, has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Ships usually take this route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north. But because of the attacks and the threat of future assaults, several of the world's largest shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels away to a much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent. BP has also paused all shipments of oil through the Red Sea, blaming the ""deteriorating security situation"". The longer journeys add at least 10 days to shipping times and cost companies millions of dollars. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come via the strait of Bab al-Mandab and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). About nine million barrels of oil per day were shipped through the Suez Canal in the first half of 2023, according to freight analytics firm Vortexa. Analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence said nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. But it is not just about oil. Container ships carry all sorts of consumer goods seen in the shops including TVs, clothes, trainers and sports equipment. It is inevitable that supply chains will be affected due to ships being diverted away from the Red Sea, but consumer goods ""will face the largest impact"", according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, though he does note the current disruption has occurred ""during the off-peak shipping season"". Delays to products reaching shops can be expected, due to the Cape of Good Hope route adding about 3,500 nautical miles. Furniture giant Ikea and UK retailer Next have both warned that supplies of products could be delayed if disruption to shipping continues. Tesla has suspended manufacturing at its only European electric car factory due to supplies being disrupted. The extra distance will also cost companies more. According to supply chain advisers Drewry, the price of using a 40ft container has risen by 15% in the past week. These extra costs could be passed on by businesses to customers. However, container rates are still far below the levels seen in 2021, when freight charges soared in line with demand as Covid restrictions were eased. There are also fears the disruption could push up oil prices. A rise in oil prices, a key ingredient in car fuel, can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%. When it comes to shipments of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) being disrupted, even if wholesale energy prices rise, any increases would not feed through to domestic bills until April 2024 at the earliest. This is because the energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, has already been set for January. Is moving freight by sea the only option? Mr Rogers says transporting goods by rail instead would require ""crossing Russia"", which is under economic sanctions due to invading Ukraine, while ""trucking from the Gulf to Israel may only offset around 3% of shipping"". The US had launched an international naval operation in December to try to protect ships on the Red Sea route. This operation was joined by countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain, but some shipping companies remained reluctant to start using the route again. Maersk resumed shipments through the Red Sea briefly following the introduction of the security operation, but paused sailings again after one of its container ships came under attack. US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have now launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen. ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" US President Joe Biden said.","['Companies', 'Shipping containers', 'Yemen', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Shipping industry', 'Houthis', 'BP']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12641/production/_132092357_houthis.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8528/production/_132288043_suez_canal_alternative_route-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/108FF/production/_132093876_red_sea_trade-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Michael Race', 'Business reporter, BBC News']",World,Middle East

The decision to commit the UK to military action is a landmark moment in any prime minister's tenure in office. The government has the prerogative to do this without wider political consultation. But in this instance, ministers concluded there was sufficient time to brief the cabinet, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle before any strikes began. Sir Lindsay and Mr Healey attended a briefing in person in Whitehall. Sir Keir joined the briefing remotely. 'I understand the briefing was conducted by the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. These conversations are a courtesy. But they are more than a courtesy. Ministers are aware of the scepticism, in parliament and beyond, about the wisdom, or lack of it attached to British military operations over recent decades. Take the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, until very recently a minister himself. Writing on social media, he said: ""Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front: What counts as success? Realistically, how far [would] we need to go to achieve this? How will we avoid being dragged into something we don't want?"" For his part, the prime minister said in a statement that the Houthi attacks ""cannot stand"". He continued: ""The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade. We have therefore taken limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"". And it is likely there will be a statement and a debate in the Commons, perhaps on Monday, with the government pressed to elaborate on just these kind of points: what it hopes to achieve, by when and at what cost. Not soon enough, some will argue. We have already heard from the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru. The Lib Dems and Plaid say it is wrong that parliament has been bypassed. The SNP leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: ""It is incumbent upon the UK Government to appraise Parliament as soon as possible and MPs must therefore be recalled to Westminster"". This moment has looked increasingly likely: a military response to match the rhetoric threatening just that. It was impossible not to join the dots when Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was asked on Wednesday about the prospect of military action against Houthis and said: ""Watch this space."" He could have ducked the question. He instead implied something was coming. So, what next, diplomatically, geopolitically, militarily and economically? There are risks associated with action. And risks associated with doing nothing. The risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East? A further shrivelling of shipping traffic through the Red Sea, a vital artery of the world economy? Let's see. And all this after the twin global shocks of the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic. More uncertainty beckons: unknown consequences abound.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67947335,Arctic blast: Record-breaking cold weather forecast for many states,A massive winter storm has begun rolling across the US and is predicted to bring dangerously cold temperatures and severe weather through the weekend.,2024-01-12,"A massive winter storm has begun rolling across the US and is predicted to bring dangerously cold temperatures and severe weather through the weekend. From blizzards and ""large hail"" to thunderstorms and tornadoes, the National Weather Service has issued weather alerts in nearly every state. Wind chills up to -45F (-42C) are forecast in Iowa, where voters are preparing to participate in the state's caucuses on Monday. It is the week's third major US storm. Going into the three-day weekend, thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled and people began experiencing power outages on Friday. New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in advance of a storm in the western part of the state, activating the National Guard. A wind advisory warned of gusts up to 50mph (80km/h) from Texas to New York. Texas braced for lower temperatures and more frost than it saw last winter, evoking memories of the Great Texas Freeze of 2021. In parts of Texas, the NWS issued a wind chill watch through Saturday, and warned of hypothermia and frostbite. It predicted wind chills there could drop to -25F (-32C). The average low temperature in Texas was forecast at 15F (-9C), prompting some concern among state energy suppliers, which saw the power grid collapse in 2021. Texas Gov Greg Abbott told residents at a press briefing on Friday to be ""very, very cautious"" and to expect ""ultra-cold temperatures"", adding that warming centres will be available for those in need. He said another days-long blackout was unlikely. ""The power is going to stay on throughout the entirety of this winter storm episode,"" Gov Abbott said, telling Texans that there were backup generators and enough fuel for those generators to avoid a 2021 repeat. Still, there were more than 3,000 power outages in Houston on Friday afternoon, according to CenterPoint Energy, a local distributor. To the east, in Alabama, more than 11,000 customers lost power, according to a local meteorologist, who said the weather there was less severe than anticipated. In the area where Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana meet, the NWS said there was a risk of ""damaging winds, large hail, and possibly a strong tornado"". Further north, record cold temperatures brought by frigid wind chills were predicted, with over a foot of snow forecasted in some places like upper Michigan. Up to 8in (20cm) of snow was forecasted in Chicago, Illinois. Over 80,000 Illinois residents were without power as of Friday morning, according to poweroutage.us, as flight cancellations and delays in the region have swelled. Chicago Mayor Donna Johnson told the Weather Channel that she was among those to lose power. The state's governor, JB Pritzker, wrote to Texas Governor Abbott, requesting an immediate pause in sending migrants to the state by plane and bus. He said in a letter that the weather could threaten the lives of families and children. The mix of cold, snow and high winds is expected to bring blizzard conditions to other nearby states. Winter storm warnings were issued in Iowa, where Republican voters are supposed to gather on Monday to select their state's presidential nominee, as well as Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. In northern Missouri, wind chills up to 35 degrees below zero were predicted, along with 2-4in of snow, and wind gusts up to 45mph.  Those cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes, the NWS warned. ""We call it 'life-threatening' for a reason,"" a local Missouri branch of the service wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Take it seriously. This kind of cold does not happen very often."" Wind chill warnings ranging from -55F (-48C) to -35F (-37C) have been issued across the northwest, from Washington to North Dakota, and down to Nebraska and Kansas. In Hawaii, wind advisories have also been issued warning locals of wind gusts over 75mph. However, rapid bursts of wind have already began plaguing some parts of the US. Over 4,000 miles away, in Fort Myers, Florida, local news footage showed residents battling wind gusts up to 30mph. And storm surges in the area were predicted to be up to 18ft high. The storm has also been disruptive in Iowa, a state hit by snow and frosty temperatures earlier this week. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Friday cancelled her in-person events scheduled in the state due to ""potentially dangerous weather conditions"". Ron DeSantis also cancelled two in-person events ""due to unsafe weather"", his campaign said, though Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump are still scheduled to press on ahead of Monday's caucuses in the Hawkeye State. Iowa's transportation department urged drivers to stay off the roads, warning of ""treacherous driving conditions"" across most of the state, with some routes impassable and drivers possibly encountering ""whiteout conditions, drifting snow, and slick roads"". Canadian officials issued weather warnings on Friday to every province and territory in the country. Residents in Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes were told to brace for up to one foot of snow and extreme cold temperatures. Wind chills in parts of Ontario and Quebec were forecasted to reach -30C (-22F) to -38C (-36F), bone chilling temperatures only half as cold as the -67F predicted for parts of Alberta.","['United States', 'Severe weather']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1EF9/production/_132292970_d611a431b0e721643351b6b0f0f4e9eb54c7f8440_0_5394_30341000x563.jpg'],"['By Brandon Drenon', 'BBC News, Washington']",World,US & Canada

They argued, with support from some Republicans, that President Joe Biden violated the US Constitution by not seeking congressional approval first. But several Republicans offered rare praise of the administration, calling it an ""overdue"" act of deterrence. The president on Thursday called the precision strikes a ""defensive action"". In a joint statement with coalition partners - the UK, Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands - the White House said it had acted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter"". Though Mr Biden notified Congress prior to the strikes launched on 16 Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, he did not seek its authorisation. Several progressives in the president's party fumed that his actions violated Article I of the Constitution, which requires that the power to declare war be granted by Congress. ""This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution,"" Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict,"" said California Congressman Ro Khanna. ""I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House."" ""The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians,"" added Missouri's Cori Bush. ""Stop the bombing and do better by us."" Even some Republicans added their voice of disapproval. ""I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?"" asked Rep Chip Roy of Texas. US presidents, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, have often carried out strikes without first seeking congressional approval. After Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani, Mr Biden argued that presidents ""should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people"". But under the Biden administration, the US military has previously launched strikes in Syria and Iraq without going to Congress. Experts say the legal justification lies with the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution passed by Congress in 2001, which the US has used to justify various troop deployments and counter-terrorism operations around the world over the past two decades. Even without the AUMF resolution in effect, some have argued another piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, grants a president broad powers to take military action. Despite the criticism from some elements of Congress, top Republicans and Democrats have backed Mr Biden's decision. ""I welcome the US and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday night. ""President Biden's decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue,"" the top Republican added. Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, agreed. ""I support President Biden's decision to take precise action against these increasingly dangerous provocations that have threatened the interests of the US and our allies, and welcome our coalition partners taking these actions with us,"" Mr Cardin said. Senior administration officials have made clear that an attack on an American commercial vessel, being escorted by US military vessels on Tuesday, was the tipping point for Thursday night's action. Twenty drones and three missiles were shot down and, had that not happened, officials say the ships could have been sunk, including one that was carrying jet fuel. The fact that this action was clearly telegraphed in both Washington and London is a clear indication that the US and UK governments, along with the other members of what officials in Washington DC call ""a coalition of the willing"" wanted to minimise any collateral damage and loss of life: degrading facilities and capabilities was, they say, their aim. The Pentagon is expected to give further details of the battle damage assessment in the coming hours and days, but one senior administration official said indications were that they had had ""good effects"". The concern in Washington has always been the escalation of the Gaza conflict to the wider region, and officials continue to stress that this is their key aim. But they are also acutely aware of the potential commercial damage to the world economy should shipping continue to come under fire in the route through the Red Sea and the Suez canal. In his statement on Thursday, Mr Biden said he ""will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary"".","['Iran-US relations', 'Yemen', 'Joe Biden', 'United States', 'Houthis']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EDC/production/_132288102_gettyimages-1556765674.jpg'],"[""By Sam Cabral and Gary O'Donoghue"", 'BBC News, Washington']",World,US & Canada

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67948573,US election 2024: Can Nikki Haley really stop Donald Trump?,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat.",2024-01-12,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat. On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border. At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normalcy, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump. ""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said. The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines. Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back. Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls. ""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday. The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with."" The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points. Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics: that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense. ""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project. ""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do."" So what exactly is her game plan? Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win. They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election. In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. At a Wednesday evening debate between the two, Ms Haley strained to position herself as Mr Trump's sole rival. ""I wish Donald Trump was on this stage. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said. Campaign aides told the BBC that the goal for Ms Haley in Iowa is simple: build momentum. A strong showing, they said, would carry her into New Hampshire - where polls with Mr Trump are much tighter - and then on to South Carolina, her home state. Ms Haley may be helped by the sudden exit of anti-Trump candidate, Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign this week. Supporters of the former New Jersey Governor, surveys suggest, are most likely to flock to her. Less helpful was Mr Christie's hot-mic moment, when he was caught saying she would ""get smoked"", presumably by Mr Trump. ""She's not up to this,"" he said. Long-time observers counter that Ms Haley has a knack for defying expectations. ""If you look at her career, a lot of people have underestimated her and a lot of people have been wrong,"" said Randy Covington, a veteran journalist from South Carolina. Even her critics acknowledge that she is a master of retail politics - the door-knocking and handshaking that delivered her to the statehouse in 2005. She stunned her own party in the primary by unseating Larry Koon, then the longest-serving member of the House. At the time, Ms Haley had no political experience and was a bookkeeper for her family's clothing shop. Nearly 20 years later, the state representative-turned-governor-turned-UN-ambassador still likes to introduce herself first as an accountant. She points out that she is a mom of two, the wife of a combat veteran and the child of Indian immigrants, running to make her family proud. In televised debates, in pancake houses and town halls, Ms Haley pauses mid-speech for a smile and pointed eye contact. She's a down-home American hard at work for your vote. ""She connects, she has the X factor,"" said David Wilkins, a former South Carolina House speaker who led Ms Haley's transition to the governor's house. ""The more people who are exposed to her, the more support she's going to get, it's just that simple."" Ms Haley's campaign often looks and sounds like something out of 2012: more compromise and pragmatism, fewer grievances and conspiracy theories. She is a staunch conservative, but she speaks with nuance on hot button issues like abortion and immigration, and is less eager to wade into the country's culture wars. In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces. ""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted."" Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election. ""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points."" But she has to defeat Mr Trump first. ""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant. At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley. ""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider."" The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre. She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else. Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming. In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"". Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations. Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first."" The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa. The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","['Nikki Haley', 'Donald Trump', 'US election 2024', 'United States', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED42/production/_132283706_nikkismiling.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7812/production/_132283703_nikkitop.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4AE/production/_132283626_ronandnikki.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5DA/production/_132283926_gettyimages-1926034122.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Holly Honderich', 'in Des Moines, Iowa']",World,US & Canada

In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces. ""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted."" Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election. ""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points."" But she has to defeat Mr Trump first. ""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant. At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley. ""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider."" The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre. She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else. Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming. In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"". Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations. Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first."" The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa. The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","['Nikki Haley', 'Donald Trump', 'US election 2024', 'United States', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED42/production/_132283706_nikkismiling.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7812/production/_132283703_nikkitop.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4AE/production/_132283626_ronandnikki.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5DA/production/_132283926_gettyimages-1926034122.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Holly Honderich', 'in Des Moines, Iowa']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67959375,Progressive Democrats fume over Houthi strikes as Republicans offer rare praise,Progressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.,2024-01-12,"Progressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. They argued, with support from some Republicans, that President Joe Biden violated the US Constitution by not seeking congressional approval first. But several Republicans offered rare praise of the administration, calling it an ""overdue"" act of deterrence. The president on Thursday called the precision strikes a ""defensive action"". In a joint statement with coalition partners - the UK, Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands - the White House said it had acted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter"". Though Mr Biden notified Congress prior to the strikes launched on 16 Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, he did not seek its authorisation. Several progressives in the president's party fumed that his actions violated Article I of the Constitution, which requires that the power to declare war be granted by Congress. ""This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution,"" Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict,"" said California Congressman Ro Khanna. ""I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House."" ""The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians,"" added Missouri's Cori Bush. ""Stop the bombing and do better by us."" Even some Republicans added their voice of disapproval. ""I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?"" asked Rep Chip Roy of Texas. US presidents, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, have often carried out strikes without first seeking congressional approval. After Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani, Mr Biden argued that presidents ""should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people"". But under the Biden administration, the US military has previously launched strikes in Syria and Iraq without going to Congress. Experts say the legal justification lies with the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution passed by Congress in 2001, which the US has used to justify various troop deployments and counter-terrorism operations around the world over the past two decades. Even without the AUMF resolution in effect, some have argued another piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, grants a president broad powers to take military action. Despite the criticism from some elements of Congress, top Republicans and Democrats have backed Mr Biden's decision. ""I welcome the US and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday night. ""President Biden's decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue,"" the top Republican added. Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, agreed. ""I support President Biden's decision to take precise action against these increasingly dangerous provocations that have threatened the interests of the US and our allies, and welcome our coalition partners taking these actions with us,"" Mr Cardin said. Senior administration officials have made clear that an attack on an American commercial vessel, being escorted by US military vessels on Tuesday, was the tipping point for Thursday night's action. Twenty drones and three missiles were shot down and, had that not happened, officials say the ships could have been sunk, including one that was carrying jet fuel. The fact that this action was clearly telegraphed in both Washington and London is a clear indication that the US and UK governments, along with the other members of what officials in Washington DC call ""a coalition of the willing"" wanted to minimise any collateral damage and loss of life: degrading facilities and capabilities was, they say, their aim. The Pentagon is expected to give further details of the battle damage assessment in the coming hours and days, but one senior administration official said indications were that they had had ""good effects"". The concern in Washington has always been the escalation of the Gaza conflict to the wider region, and officials continue to stress that this is their key aim. But they are also acutely aware of the potential commercial damage to the world economy should shipping continue to come under fire in the route through the Red Sea and the Suez canal. In his statement on Thursday, Mr Biden said he ""will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary"".","['Iran-US relations', 'Yemen', 'Joe Biden', 'United States', 'Houthis']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EDC/production/_132288102_gettyimages-1556765674.jpg'],"[""By Sam Cabral and Gary O'Donoghue"", 'BBC News, Washington']",World,US & Canada

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67964671,Buffalo: US seeks death penalty for gunman in racist shooting,The US federal government is seeking the death penalty for a white gunman who killed 10 people in a racially-motivated 2022 shooting.,2024-01-12,"The US federal government is seeking the death penalty for a white gunman who killed 10 people in a racially-motivated 2022 shooting. The US Department of Justice, in a Biden administration first, said capital punishment is warranted due to the shooting's effect on victims. Payton Gendron, 20, was sentenced to life in prison last year for the Buffalo, New York, shooting. Gendron has said he killed people that day ""because they were black"". The justice department outlined its arguments for the death penalty in a court filing on Friday. Under President Joe Biden, the federal government has not previously sought capital punishment and the longtime politician has stated his opposition to it. But the agency said in its court filing that the sentence was warranted because Gendron intentionally targeted the victims he killed and injured for their race when he opened fire at a grocery store on 14 May, 2022. All 10 people who were killed in the shooting at a Buffalo supermarket were black. The victims ranged in age from 32 to 86, and included eight grocery store shoppers, a store security guard and a church deacon that drove people to and from the store to do their shopping. The gunman's actions that day were planned, premediated, and fuelled by his ""bias, hatred and contempt toward Black persons"", the agency's court filing says. Merrick Garland, the US attorney general who leads the justice department, instituted a moratorium on federal executions pending a review of procedures in 2021. This court filing suggests that review has concluded. New York state does not have capital punishment, but the gunman is facing hate crime and gun charges in a separate federal case. In those federal cases, the Justice Department can seek the death penalty. Though her state banned capital punishment, Kathy Hochul - New York's governor - said she agreed with the decision. ""This complies with the DOJ requirements for what constitutes a death penalty offense,"" Ms Hochul said at a press conference on Friday. Lawyers for the victims and families affected by the shooting said they welcomed the DOJ's request for the death penalty. ""Today's decision by the Department of Justice provides a pathway to both relief and a measure of closure for the victims and their families,"" the lawyers said. ""They have been pleading for full justice for nearly two years, and today they are one step closer."" The gunman, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, had driven more than 320km (200 miles) across the state to a predominantly black neighbourhood before carrying out the attack. He describes himself as a fascist and white supremacist in a 180-page document that he allegedly wrote before the shooting. He pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges in 2022. At his sentencing, the judge overseeing the case told the gunman that ""there is no place for you or your ignorant, hateful and evil ideologies in a civilized society"". ""There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances,"" Erie County Judge Susan Eagan said. ""You will never see the light of day as a free man ever again.""","['Capital punishment', 'Joe Biden', 'US gun violence', 'United States', 'New York']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1125F/production/_132293207_gettyimages-1404060882.jpg'],"['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

Asked by reporters if he remained confident in Mr Austin's leadership, Mr Biden replied, ""I do."" Mr Biden learned of Mr Austin's condition just prior to him making it public on Wednesday. He replied ""yes"" when asked if Mr Austin's silence had been a lapse in judgement. Mr Biden's backing of the country's top military official comes hours after the US and United Kingdom launched military strikes against the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, which has been attacking commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea region. Mr Austin , 70, remained hospitalised during the strikes but continued to carry out his duties during the joint attack, according to the Pentagon and White House. Maj Gen Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, told BBC News that Mr Austin ""gave the order to the US Central Command commander to go ahead and execute the strikes"". The defence secretary monitored the attack from his hospital bed from a ""full communication suite"", Gen Ryder said. He also has spoken multiple times with President Biden, the US national security adviser, and numerous other military leaders. ""He has been very actively engaged throughout and continues to monitor the situation today,"" Gen Ryder said. Gen Ryder said Wednesday that Mr Austin had no plans to resign. Mr Austin had a ""minimally invasive"" surgery to treat prostate cancer in late December. He was readmitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on 1 January due to complications related to the procedure. That second hospital visit was not disclosed to the White House or the appropriate Pentagon officials for several days, leading to sharp criticism from lawmakers of both parties and clear frustration from the White House. The president did not learn Mr Austin had prostate cancer until Wednesday morning, the White House said, just hours before the Pentagon and Walter Reed revealed the diagnosis and treatment timeline to the public. The White House had learned earlier of Mr Austin's hospitalisation, but no-one within the chain of command was notified of his absence because the defence secretary's chief of staff was sick with the flu, Pentagon officials said. Mr Austin has apologized for not ""ensuring the public was appropriately informed"", and the Pentagon has pledged to conduct a review of their internal procedures.

It follows last week's release of body camera footage from the moments before Aderrien Murry was shot in his home after calling police for help. He suffered a collapsed lung, fractured ribs and a lacerated liver. His family is suing the city where it took place. The officer involved has been cleared of criminal conduct and reinstated. The flurry of new information about the May 2023 shooting in the city of Indianola follows a nearly seven-month probe by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI). Last month, the state's attorney general said Sergeant Greg Capers will not face charges after a grand jury determined the bureau's findings showed no evidence of criminal conduct on his part. Sergeant Capers, who was placed on unpaid administrative leave after the shooting, has since re-joined the Indianola Police Department. But the Murry family has continued to argue the shooting was not justified, with Aderrien's mother, Nakala, pushing for footage from the incident to be publicly released. The newly released 911 recordings raise questions about whether Mr Capers knew there was a child in the house when he and another officer responded to domestic disturbance calls placed by Ms Murry's mother, who was not there, and then by Aderrien. A man later identified as John Nolden, the father of one of Ms Murry's other children, had shown up unexpectedly at the home in the early hours of the morning. That led a frightened Ms Murry to give her son a cell phone and ask him to call for help, first by informing his grandmother and then by calling 911. Last Friday, in response to Ms Murry's repeated pleas, state officials released body camera footage of the moments leading up to the shooting of Aderrien. The video shows Mr Capers approaching the Murry home with a colleague, repeatedly banging on the front door and - with permission from the 911 dispatcher - unsuccessfully attempting to kick it open. When Ms Murry opens the door, he is heard twice shouting: ""Let me see your hands."" Ms Murry immediately complies. ""Where's he at?"" Mr Capers then asks twice. As Ms Murry gestures inside the home with her head, he asks her to come out of the house and she steps outside. The officer is then heard repeatedly asking the intruder to come out, adding ""don't make us come in"". He also asks if the man is armed, to which Ms Murry appears to respond that he is not. As Mr Capers enters the empty living room, Aderrien walks into the frame with his hands over his head. Mr Capers immediately opens fire, shoots him in the chest and then says ""Oh, my god"". As the boy screams in pain and runs out the door yelling for his mother, the officer begins calling for an ambulance on his dispatch radio. ""What did I do?"" Aderrien is said to have asked his mother after being shot. ""I don't want to die."" He spent four days recovering in a local hospital, during which he was placed on a ventilator and given a chest tube. Sharing his story for the first time in May with Good Morning America (GMA), the child described feeling like he had been struck by ""a big punch to the chest"". He also said he had previously wanted to be a police officer but changed his mind after the shooting. In a December GMA interview, Mr Capers, who is also black, said the shooting was ""spur of the moment"" and ""definitely wasn't intentional"". National law enforcement statistics suggest domestic disturbance calls are dangerous for US police, often leading to officer assaults and even deaths. Experts say that puts them on high alert. Carlos Moore, an attorney representing the Murry family, said in a statement that the video footage ""allows the world to independently assess whether the actions of Greg Capers were justified"". After the MBI declined to release copies of Aderrien's 911 call, saying that it would violate state law, Mr Moore released the tapes himself on Thursday. The five minutes of audio detail four separate 911 calls, including the first from Aderrien's grandmother and the one placed by the boy himself. The tapes suggest that the 911 dispatcher may not have conveyed to Mr Capers and his colleague that there was a boy inside the house and it was he who called for help.

From blizzards and ""large hail"" to thunderstorms and tornadoes, the National Weather Service has issued weather alerts in nearly every state. Wind chills up to -45F (-42C) are forecast in Iowa, where voters are preparing to participate in the state's caucuses on Monday. It is the week's third major US storm. Going into the three-day weekend, thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled and people began experiencing power outages on Friday. New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in advance of a storm in the western part of the state, activating the National Guard. A wind advisory warned of gusts up to 50mph (80km/h) from Texas to New York. Texas braced for lower temperatures and more frost than it saw last winter, evoking memories of the Great Texas Freeze of 2021. In parts of Texas, the NWS issued a wind chill watch through Saturday, and warned of hypothermia and frostbite. It predicted wind chills there could drop to -25F (-32C). The average low temperature in Texas was forecast at 15F (-9C), prompting some concern among state energy suppliers, which saw the power grid collapse in 2021. Texas Gov Greg Abbott told residents at a press briefing on Friday to be ""very, very cautious"" and to expect ""ultra-cold temperatures"", adding that warming centres will be available for those in need. He said another days-long blackout was unlikely. ""The power is going to stay on throughout the entirety of this winter storm episode,"" Gov Abbott said, telling Texans that there were backup generators and enough fuel for those generators to avoid a 2021 repeat. Still, there were more than 3,000 power outages in Houston on Friday afternoon, according to CenterPoint Energy, a local distributor. To the east, in Alabama, more than 11,000 customers lost power, according to a local meteorologist, who said the weather there was less severe than anticipated. In the area where Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana meet, the NWS said there was a risk of ""damaging winds, large hail, and possibly a strong tornado"". Further north, record cold temperatures brought by frigid wind chills were predicted, with over a foot of snow forecasted in some places like upper Michigan. Up to 8in (20cm) of snow was forecasted in Chicago, Illinois. Over 80,000 Illinois residents were without power as of Friday morning, according to poweroutage.us, as flight cancellations and delays in the region have swelled. Chicago Mayor Donna Johnson told the Weather Channel that she was among those to lose power. The state's governor, JB Pritzker, wrote to Texas Governor Abbott, requesting an immediate pause in sending migrants to the state by plane and bus. He said in a letter that the weather could threaten the lives of families and children. The mix of cold, snow and high winds is expected to bring blizzard conditions to other nearby states. Winter storm warnings were issued in Iowa, where Republican voters are supposed to gather on Monday to select their state's presidential nominee, as well as Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. In northern Missouri, wind chills up to 35 degrees below zero were predicted, along with 2-4in of snow, and wind gusts up to 45mph.  Those cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes, the NWS warned. ""We call it 'life-threatening' for a reason,"" a local Missouri branch of the service wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Take it seriously. This kind of cold does not happen very often."" Wind chill warnings ranging from -55F (-48C) to -35F (-37C) have been issued across the northwest, from Washington to North Dakota, and down to Nebraska and Kansas. In Hawaii, wind advisories have also been issued warning locals of wind gusts over 75mph. However, rapid bursts of wind have already began plaguing some parts of the US. Over 4,000 miles away, in Fort Myers, Florida, local news footage showed residents battling wind gusts up to 30mph. And storm surges in the area were predicted to be up to 18ft high. The storm has also been disruptive in Iowa, a state hit by snow and frosty temperatures earlier this week. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Friday cancelled her in-person events scheduled in the state due to ""potentially dangerous weather conditions"". Ron DeSantis also cancelled two in-person events ""due to unsafe weather"", his campaign said, though Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump are still scheduled to press on ahead of Monday's caucuses in the Hawkeye State. Iowa's transportation department urged drivers to stay off the roads, warning of ""treacherous driving conditions"" across most of the state, with some routes impassable and drivers possibly encountering ""whiteout conditions, drifting snow, and slick roads"". Canadian officials issued weather warnings on Friday to every province and territory in the country. Residents in Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes were told to brace for up to one foot of snow and extreme cold temperatures. Wind chills in parts of Ontario and Quebec were forecasted to reach -30C (-22F) to -38C (-36F), bone chilling temperatures only half as cold as the -67F predicted for parts of Alberta.","['United States', 'Severe weather']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1EF9/production/_132292970_d611a431b0e721643351b6b0f0f4e9eb54c7f8440_0_5394_30341000x563.jpg'],"['By Brandon Drenon', 'BBC News, Washington']",World,US & Canada

The US Department of Justice, in a Biden administration first, said capital punishment is warranted due to the shooting's effect on victims. Payton Gendron, 20, was sentenced to life in prison last year for the Buffalo, New York, shooting. Gendron has said he killed people that day ""because they were black"". The justice department outlined its arguments for the death penalty in a court filing on Friday. Under President Joe Biden, the federal government has not previously sought capital punishment and the longtime politician has stated his opposition to it. But the agency said in its court filing that the sentence was warranted because Gendron intentionally targeted the victims he killed and injured for their race when he opened fire at a grocery store on 14 May, 2022. All 10 people who were killed in the shooting at a Buffalo supermarket were black. The victims ranged in age from 32 to 86, and included eight grocery store shoppers, a store security guard and a church deacon that drove people to and from the store to do their shopping. The gunman's actions that day were planned, premediated, and fuelled by his ""bias, hatred and contempt toward Black persons"", the agency's court filing says. Merrick Garland, the US attorney general who leads the justice department, instituted a moratorium on federal executions pending a review of procedures in 2021. This court filing suggests that review has concluded. New York state does not have capital punishment, but the gunman is facing hate crime and gun charges in a separate federal case. In those federal cases, the Justice Department can seek the death penalty. Though her state banned capital punishment, Kathy Hochul - New York's governor - said she agreed with the decision. ""This complies with the DOJ requirements for what constitutes a death penalty offense,"" Ms Hochul said at a press conference on Friday. Lawyers for the victims and families affected by the shooting said they welcomed the DOJ's request for the death penalty. ""Today's decision by the Department of Justice provides a pathway to both relief and a measure of closure for the victims and their families,"" the lawyers said. ""They have been pleading for full justice for nearly two years, and today they are one step closer."" The gunman, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, had driven more than 320km (200 miles) across the state to a predominantly black neighbourhood before carrying out the attack. He describes himself as a fascist and white supremacist in a 180-page document that he allegedly wrote before the shooting. He pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges in 2022. At his sentencing, the judge overseeing the case told the gunman that ""there is no place for you or your ignorant, hateful and evil ideologies in a civilized society"". ""There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances,"" Erie County Judge Susan Eagan said. ""You will never see the light of day as a free man ever again.""","['Capital punishment', 'Joe Biden', 'US gun violence', 'United States', 'New York']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1125F/production/_132293207_gettyimages-1404060882.jpg'],"['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67948573,US election 2024: Can Nikki Haley really stop Donald Trump?,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat.",2024-01-12,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat. On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border. At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normalcy, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump. ""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said. The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines. Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back. Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls. ""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday. The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with."" The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points. Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics: that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense. ""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project. ""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do."" So what exactly is her game plan? Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win. They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election. In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. At a Wednesday evening debate between the two, Ms Haley strained to position herself as Mr Trump's sole rival. ""I wish Donald Trump was on this stage. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said. Campaign aides told the BBC that the goal for Ms Haley in Iowa is simple: build momentum. A strong showing, they said, would carry her into New Hampshire - where polls with Mr Trump are much tighter - and then on to South Carolina, her home state. Ms Haley may be helped by the sudden exit of anti-Trump candidate, Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign this week. Supporters of the former New Jersey Governor, surveys suggest, are most likely to flock to her. Less helpful was Mr Christie's hot-mic moment, when he was caught saying she would ""get smoked"", presumably by Mr Trump. ""She's not up to this,"" he said. Long-time observers counter that Ms Haley has a knack for defying expectations. ""If you look at her career, a lot of people have underestimated her and a lot of people have been wrong,"" said Randy Covington, a veteran journalist from South Carolina. Even her critics acknowledge that she is a master of retail politics - the door-knocking and handshaking that delivered her to the statehouse in 2005. She stunned her own party in the primary by unseating Larry Koon, then the longest-serving member of the House. At the time, Ms Haley had no political experience and was a bookkeeper for her family's clothing shop. Nearly 20 years later, the state representative-turned-governor-turned-UN-ambassador still likes to introduce herself first as an accountant. She points out that she is a mom of two, the wife of a combat veteran and the child of Indian immigrants, running to make her family proud. In televised debates, in pancake houses and town halls, Ms Haley pauses mid-speech for a smile and pointed eye contact. She's a down-home American hard at work for your vote. ""She connects, she has the X factor,"" said David Wilkins, a former South Carolina House speaker who led Ms Haley's transition to the governor's house. ""The more people who are exposed to her, the more support she's going to get, it's just that simple."" Ms Haley's campaign often looks and sounds like something out of 2012: more compromise and pragmatism, fewer grievances and conspiracy theories. She is a staunch conservative, but she speaks with nuance on hot button issues like abortion and immigration, and is less eager to wade into the country's culture wars. In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces. ""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted."" Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election. ""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points."" But she has to defeat Mr Trump first. ""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant. At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley. ""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider."" The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre. She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else. Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming. In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"". Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations. Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first."" The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa. The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","['Nikki Haley', 'Donald Trump', 'US election 2024', 'United States', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED42/production/_132283706_nikkismiling.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7812/production/_132283703_nikkitop.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4AE/production/_132283626_ronandnikki.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5DA/production/_132283926_gettyimages-1926034122.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Holly Honderich', 'in Des Moines, Iowa']",World,US & Canada

From blizzards and ""large hail"" to thunderstorms and tornadoes, the National Weather Service has issued weather alerts in nearly every state. Wind chills up to -45F (-42C) are forecast in Iowa, where voters are preparing to participate in the state's caucuses on Monday. It is the week's third major US storm. Going into the three-day weekend, thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled and people began experiencing power outages on Friday. New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in advance of a storm in the western part of the state, activating the National Guard. A wind advisory warned of gusts up to 50mph (80km/h) from Texas to New York. Texas braced for lower temperatures and more frost than it saw last winter, evoking memories of the Great Texas Freeze of 2021. In parts of Texas, the NWS issued a wind chill watch through Saturday, and warned of hypothermia and frostbite. It predicted wind chills there could drop to -25F (-32C). The average low temperature in Texas was forecast at 15F (-9C), prompting some concern among state energy suppliers, which saw the power grid collapse in 2021.

Asked by reporters if he remained confident in Mr Austin's leadership, Mr Biden replied, ""I do."" Mr Biden learned of Mr Austin's condition just prior to him making it public on Wednesday. He replied ""yes"" when asked if Mr Austin's silence had been a lapse in judgement. Mr Biden's backing of the country's top military official comes hours after the US and United Kingdom launched military strikes against the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, which has been attacking commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea region. Mr Austin , 70, remained hospitalised during the strikes but continued to carry out his duties during the joint attack, according to the Pentagon and White House. Maj Gen Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, told BBC News that Mr Austin ""gave the order to the US Central Command commander to go ahead and execute the strikes"". The defence secretary monitored the attack from his hospital bed from a ""full communication suite"", Gen Ryder said. He also has spoken multiple times with President Biden, the US national security adviser, and numerous other military leaders. ""He has been very actively engaged throughout and continues to monitor the situation today,"" Gen Ryder said. Gen Ryder said Wednesday that Mr Austin had no plans to resign. Mr Austin had a ""minimally invasive"" surgery to treat prostate cancer in late December. He was readmitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on 1 January due to complications related to the procedure. That second hospital visit was not disclosed to the White House or the appropriate Pentagon officials for several days, leading to sharp criticism from lawmakers of both parties and clear frustration from the White House. The president did not learn Mr Austin had prostate cancer until Wednesday morning, the White House said, just hours before the Pentagon and Walter Reed revealed the diagnosis and treatment timeline to the public. The White House had learned earlier of Mr Austin's hospitalisation, but no-one within the chain of command was notified of his absence because the defence secretary's chief of staff was sick with the flu, Pentagon officials said. Mr Austin has apologized for not ""ensuring the public was appropriately informed"", and the Pentagon has pledged to conduct a review of their internal procedures.

Mr Trump's $100m lawsuit accused the newspaper and Mr Trump's estranged niece, Mary Trump, of ""an insidious plot"" to obtain his tax records. A judge dismissed it last year, saying its claims ""fail as a matter of constitutional law"". The series of articles on Mr Trump's financial affairs won a Pulitzer Prize. On Friday, New York Supreme Court Judge Robert Reed, a Democrat, ordered Mr Trump to repay the New York Times for fees incurred by his failed legal action. The judge said he arrived at the amount, $392,638, after considering several matters, including ""the complexity of the issues presented"" in the lawsuit, as well as the ""ability and reputation"" of the newspaper's lawyers. The lawsuit, over a 2018 investigation that alleged the former president was involved in ""dubious tax schemes"", accused three journalists who reported on the story of working with Mr Trump's niece as part of a ""personal vendetta"" against him. It claimed they relentlessly pursued her and convinced her to turn over documents. Judge Reed dismissed the case in May, saying that the legal system has ""long recognised that reporters are entitled to engage in legal and ordinary newsgathering activities"", The judge said the activities were at the core of the country's First Amendment, which protected the right to free speech.

It follows last week's release of body camera footage from the moments before Aderrien Murry was shot in his home after calling police for help. He suffered a collapsed lung, fractured ribs and a lacerated liver. His family is suing the city where it took place. The officer involved has been cleared of criminal conduct and reinstated. The flurry of new information about the May 2023 shooting in the city of Indianola follows a nearly seven-month probe by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI). Last month, the state's attorney general said Sergeant Greg Capers will not face charges after a grand jury determined the bureau's findings showed no evidence of criminal conduct on his part. Sergeant Capers, who was placed on unpaid administrative leave after the shooting, has since re-joined the Indianola Police Department. But the Murry family has continued to argue the shooting was not justified, with Aderrien's mother, Nakala, pushing for footage from the incident to be publicly released. The newly released 911 recordings raise questions about whether Mr Capers knew there was a child in the house when he and another officer responded to domestic disturbance calls placed by Ms Murry's mother, who was not there, and then by Aderrien. A man later identified as John Nolden, the father of one of Ms Murry's other children, had shown up unexpectedly at the home in the early hours of the morning. That led a frightened Ms Murry to give her son a cell phone and ask him to call for help, first by informing his grandmother and then by calling 911. Last Friday, in response to Ms Murry's repeated pleas, state officials released body camera footage of the moments leading up to the shooting of Aderrien. The video shows Mr Capers approaching the Murry home with a colleague, repeatedly banging on the front door and - with permission from the 911 dispatcher - unsuccessfully attempting to kick it open. When Ms Murry opens the door, he is heard twice shouting: ""Let me see your hands."" Ms Murry immediately complies. ""Where's he at?"" Mr Capers then asks twice. As Ms Murry gestures inside the home with her head, he asks her to come out of the house and she steps outside. The officer is then heard repeatedly asking the intruder to come out, adding ""don't make us come in"". He also asks if the man is armed, to which Ms Murry appears to respond that he is not. As Mr Capers enters the empty living room, Aderrien walks into the frame with his hands over his head. Mr Capers immediately opens fire, shoots him in the chest and then says ""Oh, my god"". As the boy screams in pain and runs out the door yelling for his mother, the officer begins calling for an ambulance on his dispatch radio. ""What did I do?"" Aderrien is said to have asked his mother after being shot. ""I don't want to die."" He spent four days recovering in a local hospital, during which he was placed on a ventilator and given a chest tube. Sharing his story for the first time in May with Good Morning America (GMA), the child described feeling like he had been struck by ""a big punch to the chest"". He also said he had previously wanted to be a police officer but changed his mind after the shooting. In a December GMA interview, Mr Capers, who is also black, said the shooting was ""spur of the moment"" and ""definitely wasn't intentional"". National law enforcement statistics suggest domestic disturbance calls are dangerous for US police, often leading to officer assaults and even deaths. Experts say that puts them on high alert. Carlos Moore, an attorney representing the Murry family, said in a statement that the video footage ""allows the world to independently assess whether the actions of Greg Capers were justified"". After the MBI declined to release copies of Aderrien's 911 call, saying that it would violate state law, Mr Moore released the tapes himself on Thursday. The five minutes of audio detail four separate 911 calls, including the first from Aderrien's grandmother and the one placed by the boy himself. The tapes suggest that the 911 dispatcher may not have conveyed to Mr Capers and his colleague that there was a boy inside the house and it was he who called for help. ""The audio recordings reveal that one caller advised the police that no weapons were involved, and another caller advised that there was a child in the house,"" Mr Moore said in a statement to The Enterprise-Tocsin local newspaper. ""This crucial information should have been known to the responding officers and should have informed their approach to the situation."" The city has so far declined to comment on either the video or audio releases. The Murry family is currently suing the city and its police force for $5m (£3.9m). The civil rights suit calls for Mr Capers and Indianola Police Chief Ronald Sampson to be fired. It alleges the responding officers acted with gross negligence and reckless disregard ""so outrageous that it shocks the moral and legal conscience of the community"". Indianola police were not immediately available for comment.","['United States', 'Mississippi']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10DE0/production/_132288096_22bbf4c3-d494-4d14-acd4-24a1dae1fc38.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15C00/production/_132288098_screenshot-102.png']","['By Sam Cabral', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

Asked by reporters if he remained confident in Mr Austin's leadership, Mr Biden replied, ""I do."" Mr Biden learned of Mr Austin's condition just prior to him making it public on Wednesday. He replied ""yes"" when asked if Mr Austin's silence had been a lapse in judgement. Mr Biden's backing of the country's top military official comes hours after the US and United Kingdom launched military strikes against the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, which has been attacking commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea region. Mr Austin , 70, remained hospitalised during the strikes but continued to carry out his duties during the joint attack, according to the Pentagon and White House. Maj Gen Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesperson, told BBC News that Mr Austin ""gave the order to the US Central Command commander to go ahead and execute the strikes"". The defence secretary monitored the attack from his hospital bed from a ""full communication suite"", Gen Ryder said. He also has spoken multiple times with President Biden, the US national security adviser, and numerous other military leaders. ""He has been very actively engaged throughout and continues to monitor the situation today,"" Gen Ryder said. Gen Ryder said Wednesday that Mr Austin had no plans to resign. Mr Austin had a ""minimally invasive"" surgery to treat prostate cancer in late December. He was readmitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on 1 January due to complications related to the procedure. That second hospital visit was not disclosed to the White House or the appropriate Pentagon officials for several days, leading to sharp criticism from lawmakers of both parties and clear frustration from the White House. The president did not learn Mr Austin had prostate cancer until Wednesday morning, the White House said, just hours before the Pentagon and Walter Reed revealed the diagnosis and treatment timeline to the public. The White House had learned earlier of Mr Austin's hospitalisation, but no-one within the chain of command was notified of his absence because the defence secretary's chief of staff was sick with the flu, Pentagon officials said. Mr Austin has apologized for not ""ensuring the public was appropriately informed"", and the Pentagon has pledged to conduct a review of their internal procedures.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67960717,Boeing: US regulator to increase oversight of firm after blowout,US authorities are stepping up oversight of Boeing's manufacturing line a week after a door plug broke off one of its planes mid-flight.,2024-01-12,"US authorities are stepping up oversight of Boeing's manufacturing line a week after a door plug broke off one of its planes mid-flight. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said he believed there were ""significant problems"" with the 737-9 Max jet as well as ""other manufacturing problems"". The FAA said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line. It also plans to review who is in charge of quality oversight. For years, the FAA has delegated some parts of quality reviewing of planes to Boeing, but the practice has been controversial, drawing repeated warnings of safety risks. ""It is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,"" FAA administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement. ""The grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk. The FAA is exploring the use of an independent third party to oversee Boeing's inspections and its quality system."" Boeing did not immediately comment. The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people. Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Lax oversight by the FAA was also faulted. Boeing has reported a string of smaller manufacturing issues as production resumed. The blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries, has revived scrutiny. Passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight have filed a class action lawsuit against Boeing. Their lawyers described the incident as a ""nightmare experience"" that had caused ""economic, physical and ongoing emotional consequences that have understandably deeply affected our clients"". Mark Pegram, the father of Sam Pegram, an aid worker who died in the Ethiopian Airlines 2019 crash, said the emergency should make the government reconsider the deal it made with Boeing after the the earlier fatal accidents, in which the firm paid $2.5bn but may see its criminal charge dropped. He also called for an independent industry monitor. ""The need for this independent oversight is even more necessary now when one considers the ineptness of the FAA which has failed again to properly oversee Boeing's Max aircraft production, as evidenced by these latest near catastrophes,"" he said. ""The lives of passengers should not needlessly, and once again, be put at risk."" The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating what happened on the Alaska Airlines plane, which had been in service for just eight weeks. On Thursday, the FAA formally announced an inquiry into Boeing's processes. It has also grounded 171 planes - most of the 737-9 Max fleet - with similar door plugs for inspections, which have revealed loose bolts and other issues. Boeing has said it will cooperate fully and transparently with the probes. Supplier Spirit Aerosystems is also involved. Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has already said the company will admit its ""mistake"" and has described the issue as a ""quality escape"". The FAA's Mr Whitaker told CNBC that officials believed there were ""other manufacturing problems"".","['Companies', 'Boeing', 'Aviation accidents and incidents']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17316/production/_132289949_gettyimages-1913163765-1.jpg'],,World,US & Canada

""You know, not criticising others' choices, but for me to not take off my clothes in a movie or be vulnerable in physical ways is a choice that I guess I make for myself,"" she said. The actress, interviewed by Notting Hill writer and director Richard Curtis for British Vogue, also said she nearly didn't take the film's starring role. ""Honestly, one of the hardest things I've ever had to do was your movie, playing a movie actress,"" she told him. ""I was so uncomfortable! I mean, we've talked about this so many times, but I almost didn't take the part because it just seemed - oh, it just seemed so awkward. I didn't even know how to play that person."" The star was also asked if she chose roles that represented her views on feminism. ""It would be more to the point that the things I choose not to do are representative of me,"" she replied. She added: ""But in effect, I'm choosing not to do something as opposed to choosing to do something."" Roberts said she'd had a ""G-rated career"" - referring to the US film rating for movies suitable for a general audience. She had a body double for revealing scenes as a prostitute in 1990's Pretty Woman, and has previously spoken about asking for an explicit sex scene in 2009's Duplicity to be changed. ""It's not really what I do, so if you're going to ask me to do it, you have to expect it to be toned down. You know, as a mum of three, I feel like that,"" she was reported to have said at the time. She also once said: ""I wouldn't do nudity in films. To act with my clothes on is a performance. To act with my clothes off is a documentary."" During the new Vogue interview, Curtis said there was a ""tough side"" to Roberts. ""I think I speak very plainly,"" the Oscar winner responded. ""That's kind of how I see myself. I'm very forthright. ""There are a lot of personalities in the world that don't accept that easily, and it can seem really harsh, even if I feel like I'm just being honest about something and just saying, 'This is how I see it'. I never am trying to be unkind."" She recalled that she ""loathed"" a costume that had been chosen for her to wear in a key scene in Notting Hill, so decided to send her driver back to her flat to fetch her own clothes for her to wear instead. ""It was my own flip-flops and my cute little blue velvet skirt and a T-shirt and my cardigan."" Roberts also said young film stars have a more ""exhausting"" and ""chaotic"" time now compared with the late 1980s and early 90s, when she made her name. ""I don't know if it's better [today], because it's not my experience, but it just seems very different,"" she said. ""And in a way, it seems so cluttered. There are so many elements to being famous now, it just seems exhausting. ""Whereas I feel like, and again this is just my perception, because I don't really know - I'm not a young person starting out in show business in the 21st Century - but it seems to me that it was: you meet people, you read for parts, you try to get jobs, you get a job, you try to do a good job, and from that job, you might meet some new people who might suggest you to some other people and then you might get another job and you might get paid a little bit more for that job, and it might be a little bit of a better job.

The two-time Grammy nominee, whose real name is Jason DeFord, acknowledged on Thursday the role he once played in the crisis. But he told lawmakers he has also personally seen the devastation drugs are causing across the US. ""I've attended more funerals than I care to share with y'all,"" he said. ""I could sit here and cry for days about the caskets I've carried of people I love dearly, deeply, in my soul."" Fentanyl is a leading killer in the US - contributing to over 100,000 deaths in 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six out of 10 fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills contain a lethal dose of fentanyl, the US Drug Enforcement Administration found. The Country Music Award winner urged legislators in the Senate's Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee to pass the bill, which would enforce financial sanctions against drug traffickers to disrupt the flow of the drugs coming from Mexico and China. DeFord said it is time to ""proactive"", not ""reactive"" towards the crisis. Though he was lobbying for legislation put forward by Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, he said this was a bipartisan issue. He said: ""I truly believe in my heart that this bill will stop the supply and can help stop the supply of fentanyl."" In his testimony, DeFord said 190 people on average die a day from a fentanyl overdose. He asked Congress: ""Could you imagine the national media attention it would get if they were reporting that a plane was crashing every single day and killing 190 people?"" ""But because it's 190 drug addicts, we don't feel that way,"" DeFord said, adding that society has been known to ""bully and shame drug addicts"". From the age of 14, DeFord ran into trouble with law, spending 10 years in and out of detention facilities for drug-related crimes. ""I believed when I sold drugs, genuinely, that selling drugs was a victimless crime,"" DeFord said. ""I brought my community down. I hurt people. I was the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about, just like these drug dealers are doing right now when they're mixing every drug on the market with fentanyl. And they're killing the people we love,"" he told senators.

The US and UK launched dozens of airstrikes on Friday - targeting nearly 30 Houthi positions in response to recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Five people were killed, the group reported - vowing to retaliate. Mr Biden said the strikes were a success and that he thought the Houthis were a ""terrorist"" group. Some 73 missiles were launched at Yemen during the strike, the Houthis reported. They said the attack meant UK and US interests were now legitimate targets. ""They [US and UK] committed an idiocy with this treacherous aggression,"" said Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam. ""We're not interested in a war with Yemen,"" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby. However, he added that Mr Biden ""won't hesitate to take further action to protect our troops and our facilities and international commerce"". Friday's attacks had the backing of US-UK allies including Canada and Australia. According to the Pentagon, the group may currently not have the ability to mount a significant military response. ""We did see one anti-ship ballistic missile that was fired today that did not hit any ships of any kind,"" said Director of Operations Lt Gen Douglas A Sims ll. Earlier, there were reports from a UK maritime security group that a missile was fired at a vessel off the southern coast of Yemen but no damage or injury was reported. The British maritime security firm Ambrey said it was a tanker carrying Russian oil that was wrongly targeted by the Houthis, who thought the vessel had a UK connection. But the US has made it clear they believe Iran - a Houthi ally - is pulling the strings and providing the group with the resources it needs to carry out the Red Sea attacks. Tehran, for its part, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a violation of international laws. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak denied Friday's strikes were excessive - a claim levelled by Tukey, who accused the two countries of trying to turn the Red Sea into a ""sea of blood"". Both Mr Sunak and Mr Biden faced criticism that their legislatures were not fully consulted before the attacks were launched. With tensions high over the possibility that the strikes could further destabilise the Middle East, both the UK and US are keen to stress that the airstrikes were simply to protect shipping routes and nothing to do with the Israel-Gaza conflict. The countries have backed Israel following the 7 October attacks by Hamas in which about 1,300 died and some 240 people were taken hostage. The Houthis support Hamas, which is the focus of a military campaign by Israel in Gaza that has seen 23,350 people die so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. In response to the outbreak of war, the Houthis began attacking ships they said were destined for Israel or with Israeli links, describing them as a ""legitimate target"". Some 27 ships have been targeted in the Red Sea to date, according to the Pentagon, but many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection. The threat posed by the Houthis has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December. In the Yemeni capital Sanaa - which is under Houthi control - there were mass demonstrations against the US-UK strikes. ""This rally is first to condemn this aggression against the Republic of Yemen last night,"" one man told the Reuters news agency. ""It is also a message to Britain and the United States of America in particular, that they will pay a heavy price for this aggression."" There have been regular mass rallies in Yemen in support of the Palestinians and Gaza since October but this Friday's were exceptionally large. The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" - along with the Hamas and Hezbollah groups - against Israel, the US and the wider West. They control a large swathe of north-western Yemen - including the country's largest city, Sana'a - and have effectively become the de-facto government there after seizing control in 2014. There is a whole spectrum of possible scenarios which could now develop in the Red Sea, ranging from the optimistic to the catastrophic. Best case: tempers cool, the Houthis have second thoughts and refrain from attacking any more shipping. This is unlikely. Today's mass demo shows they have massive popular support at home and they have already issued defiant warnings of retaliation. Worst case: the Houthis continue targeting shipping and also make good on their promise to attack US/UK assets and manage to score a direct missile hit on a warship. This is a militia that has spent years resisting devastating airstrikes by the Saudi Air Force and is now, thanks in part to help from Iran, more firmly in control of much of Yemen than ever. The Houthis think they are invincible. They certainly have patience and an abundance of weaponry, much of it hidden in mountain tunnels. There is now a dangerous inflection point for the US-led coalition in the Red Sea whereby it risks getting sucked into a costly and unwinnable war, just as the Saudis did.","['United States', 'Yemen', 'Houthis', 'Middle East']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9856/production/_132289983_sanaa3.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5685/production/_132294122_houthimap.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9436/production/_112924973__108893488_frankgardner_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg']",,World,US & Canada

A judge dismissed it last year, saying its claims ""fail as a matter of constitutional law"". The series of articles on Mr Trump's financial affairs won a Pulitzer Prize. On Friday, New York Supreme Court Judge Robert Reed, a Democrat, ordered Mr Trump to repay the New York Times for fees incurred by his failed legal action.

The lawsuit, over a 2018 investigation that alleged the former president was involved in ""dubious tax schemes"", accused three journalists who reported on the story of working with Mr Trump's niece as part of a ""personal vendetta"" against him. It claimed they relentlessly pursued her and convinced her to turn over documents.

The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear the coffee giant's challenge of a court order that required it to re-hire union organisers that it fired in 2021. Starbucks has said the case from US labour officials seeking the order was insufficient to justify the command. How the fight is decided could have big implications for what kind of relief US workers can hope for in labour disputes. In this case, the National Labor Relations Board sought and won an emergency court order requiring the firm to rehire seven workers at a store in Memphis, after finding that the company had unlawfully retaliated against them for union activity. Starbucks has said the staff, who invited a local news crew into a store to hear about their cause, were sacked for breaking company policies, including about off-duty access to its properties. It appealed the emergency order, known as an injunction, which was upheld by a lower court. Proponents of the temporary injunctions have said they are necessary to address harm that occurs during the lengthy time it often takes to resolve labour disputes. However, Starbucks has successfully fought off such orders in other cases where judges held regulators to a tougher standard - a sign of a split in legal opinion that it has asked the Supreme Court to settle. Business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, have filed arguments in support of Starbucks. The fight comes during an unusual uptick in labour organising in the US, which has affected companies from Amazon and Apple to major car-makers. Since 2021, staff at more than 370 Starbucks locations in the US have voted to unionise. Organisers with Starbucks Workers United have filed hundreds of complaints accusing the company of breaking labour laws in a bid to shut down the effort. In many cases, investigation by labour officials has upheld those claims. ""The company is trying to eliminate one of the most effective tools the [National Labor Relations Board] has to hold corporations accountable for unlawful acts,"" Starbucks Workers United said in a statement. ""With the Supreme Court agreeing to take up the Memphis case, Starbucks just expanded its war on its own employees to a war on all US workers."" Starbucks, which owns and operates more than 10,000 stores in the US, has denied breaking labour laws.","['Companies', 'United States', 'Starbucks', 'US Supreme Court']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16B13/production/_126374929_mediaitem102447742.jpg'],,World,US & Canada

Wind chills up to -45F (-42C) are forecast in Iowa, where voters are preparing to participate in the state's caucuses on Monday. It is the week's third major US storm. Going into the three-day weekend, thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled and people began experiencing power outages on Friday. New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in advance of a storm in the western part of the state, activating the National Guard. A wind advisory warned of gusts up to 50mph (80km/h) from Texas to New York. Texas braced for lower temperatures and more frost than it saw last winter, evoking memories of the Great Texas Freeze of 2021. In parts of Texas, the NWS issued a wind chill watch through Saturday, and warned of hypothermia and frostbite. It predicted wind chills there could drop to -25F (-32C). The average low temperature in Texas was forecast at 15F (-9C), prompting some concern among state energy suppliers, which saw the power grid collapse in 2021. Texas Gov Greg Abbott told residents at a press briefing on Friday to be ""very, very cautious"" and to expect ""ultra-cold temperatures"", adding that warming centres will be available for those in need. He said another days-long blackout was unlikely. ""The power is going to stay on throughout the entirety of this winter storm episode,"" Gov Abbott said, telling Texans that there were backup generators and enough fuel for those generators to avoid a 2021 repeat. Still, there were more than 3,000 power outages in Houston on Friday afternoon, according to CenterPoint Energy, a local distributor. To the east, in Alabama, more than 11,000 customers lost power, according to a local meteorologist, who said the weather there was less severe than anticipated. In the area where Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana meet, the NWS said there was a risk of ""damaging winds, large hail, and possibly a strong tornado"". Further north, record cold temperatures brought by frigid wind chills were predicted, with over a foot of snow forecasted in some places like upper Michigan. Up to 8in (20cm) of snow was forecasted in Chicago, Illinois. Over 80,000 Illinois residents were without power as of Friday morning, according to poweroutage.us, as flight cancellations and delays in the region have swelled. Chicago Mayor Donna Johnson told the Weather Channel that she was among those to lose power. The state's governor, JB Pritzker, wrote to Texas Governor Abbott, requesting an immediate pause in sending migrants to the state by plane and bus. He said in a letter that the weather could threaten the lives of families and children. The mix of cold, snow and high winds is expected to bring blizzard conditions to other nearby states. Winter storm warnings were issued in Iowa, where Republican voters are supposed to gather on Monday to select their state's presidential nominee, as well as Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. In northern Missouri, wind chills up to 35 degrees below zero were predicted, along with 2-4in of snow, and wind gusts up to 45mph.  Those cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes, the NWS warned. ""We call it 'life-threatening' for a reason,"" a local Missouri branch of the service wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Take it seriously. This kind of cold does not happen very often."" Wind chill warnings ranging from -55F (-48C) to -35F (-37C) have been issued across the northwest, from Washington to North Dakota, and down to Nebraska and Kansas. In Hawaii, wind advisories have also been issued warning locals of wind gusts over 75mph. However, rapid bursts of wind have already began plaguing some parts of the US. Over 4,000 miles away, in Fort Myers, Florida, local news footage showed residents battling wind gusts up to 30mph. And storm surges in the area were predicted to be up to 18ft high. The storm has also been disruptive in Iowa, a state hit by snow and frosty temperatures earlier this week. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Friday cancelled her in-person events scheduled in the state due to ""potentially dangerous weather conditions"". Ron DeSantis also cancelled two in-person events ""due to unsafe weather"", his campaign said, though Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump are still scheduled to press on ahead of Monday's caucuses in the Hawkeye State. Iowa's transportation department urged drivers to stay off the roads, warning of ""treacherous driving conditions"" across most of the state, with some routes impassable and drivers possibly encountering ""whiteout conditions, drifting snow, and slick roads"". Canadian officials issued weather warnings on Friday to every province and territory in the country. Residents in Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes were told to brace for up to one foot of snow and extreme cold temperatures. Wind chills in parts of Ontario and Quebec were forecasted to reach -30C (-22F) to -38C (-36F), bone chilling temperatures only half as cold as the -67F predicted for parts of Alberta.","['United States', 'Severe weather']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1EF9/production/_132292970_d611a431b0e721643351b6b0f0f4e9eb54c7f8440_0_5394_30341000x563.jpg'],"['By Brandon Drenon', 'BBC News, Washington']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67964671,Buffalo: US seeks death penalty for gunman in racist shooting,The US federal government is seeking the death penalty for a white gunman who killed 10 people in a racially-motivated 2022 shooting.,2024-01-12,"The US federal government is seeking the death penalty for a white gunman who killed 10 people in a racially-motivated 2022 shooting. The US Department of Justice, in a Biden administration first, said capital punishment is warranted due to the shooting's effect on victims. Payton Gendron, 20, was sentenced to life in prison last year for the Buffalo, New York, shooting. Gendron has said he killed people that day ""because they were black"". The justice department outlined its arguments for the death penalty in a court filing on Friday. Under President Joe Biden, the federal government has not previously sought capital punishment and the longtime politician has stated his opposition to it. But the agency said in its court filing that the sentence was warranted because Gendron intentionally targeted the victims he killed and injured for their race when he opened fire at a grocery store on 14 May, 2022. All 10 people who were killed in the shooting at a Buffalo supermarket were black. The victims ranged in age from 32 to 86, and included eight grocery store shoppers, a store security guard and a church deacon that drove people to and from the store to do their shopping. The gunman's actions that day were planned, premediated, and fuelled by his ""bias, hatred and contempt toward Black persons"", the agency's court filing says. Merrick Garland, the US attorney general who leads the justice department, instituted a moratorium on federal executions pending a review of procedures in 2021. This court filing suggests that review has concluded. New York state does not have capital punishment, but the gunman is facing hate crime and gun charges in a separate federal case. In those federal cases, the Justice Department can seek the death penalty. Though her state banned capital punishment, Kathy Hochul - New York's governor - said she agreed with the decision. ""This complies with the DOJ requirements for what constitutes a death penalty offense,"" Ms Hochul said at a press conference on Friday. Lawyers for the victims and families affected by the shooting said they welcomed the DOJ's request for the death penalty. ""Today's decision by the Department of Justice provides a pathway to both relief and a measure of closure for the victims and their families,"" the lawyers said. ""They have been pleading for full justice for nearly two years, and today they are one step closer."" The gunman, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, had driven more than 320km (200 miles) across the state to a predominantly black neighbourhood before carrying out the attack. He describes himself as a fascist and white supremacist in a 180-page document that he allegedly wrote before the shooting. He pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges in 2022. At his sentencing, the judge overseeing the case told the gunman that ""there is no place for you or your ignorant, hateful and evil ideologies in a civilized society"". ""There can be no mercy for you, no understanding, no second chances,"" Erie County Judge Susan Eagan said. ""You will never see the light of day as a free man ever again.""","['Capital punishment', 'Joe Biden', 'US gun violence', 'United States', 'New York']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1125F/production/_132293207_gettyimages-1404060882.jpg'],"['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

The two-time Grammy nominee, whose real name is Jason DeFord, acknowledged on Thursday the role he once played in the crisis. But he told lawmakers he has also personally seen the devastation drugs are causing across the US. ""I've attended more funerals than I care to share with y'all,"" he said. ""I could sit here and cry for days about the caskets I've carried of people I love dearly, deeply, in my soul."" Fentanyl is a leading killer in the US - contributing to over 100,000 deaths in 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six out of 10 fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills contain a lethal dose of fentanyl, the US Drug Enforcement Administration found. The Country Music Award winner urged legislators in the Senate's Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee to pass the bill, which would enforce financial sanctions against drug traffickers to disrupt the flow of the drugs coming from Mexico and China. DeFord said it is time to ""proactive"", not ""reactive"" towards the crisis. Though he was lobbying for legislation put forward by Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, he said this was a bipartisan issue. He said: ""I truly believe in my heart that this bill will stop the supply and can help stop the supply of fentanyl."" In his testimony, DeFord said 190 people on average die a day from a fentanyl overdose. He asked Congress: ""Could you imagine the national media attention it would get if they were reporting that a plane was crashing every single day and killing 190 people?"" ""But because it's 190 drug addicts, we don't feel that way,"" DeFord said, adding that society has been known to ""bully and shame drug addicts"". From the age of 14, DeFord ran into trouble with law, spending 10 years in and out of detention facilities for drug-related crimes. ""I believed when I sold drugs, genuinely, that selling drugs was a victimless crime,"" DeFord said. ""I brought my community down. I hurt people. I was the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about, just like these drug dealers are doing right now when they're mixing every drug on the market with fentanyl. And they're killing the people we love,"" he told senators. He said he stands before Congress now ""as a man that wants to be a part of the solution"".","['United States', 'Fentanyl']",,"['By Chloe Kim', 'BBC News, New York']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67959372,"Aderrien Murry: Audio and video offer clues on shooting of boy, 11, by police",Attorneys have released 911 dispatch audio tapes that suggest mistakes were made in the lead-up to police shooting an 11-year-old boy in Mississippi.,2024-01-12,"Attorneys have released 911 dispatch audio tapes that suggest mistakes were made in the lead-up to police shooting an 11-year-old boy in Mississippi. It follows last week's release of body camera footage from the moments before Aderrien Murry was shot in his home after calling police for help. He suffered a collapsed lung, fractured ribs and a lacerated liver. His family is suing the city where it took place. The officer involved has been cleared of criminal conduct and reinstated. The flurry of new information about the May 2023 shooting in the city of Indianola follows a nearly seven-month probe by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI). Last month, the state's attorney general said Sergeant Greg Capers will not face charges after a grand jury determined the bureau's findings showed no evidence of criminal conduct on his part. Sergeant Capers, who was placed on unpaid administrative leave after the shooting, has since re-joined the Indianola Police Department. But the Murry family has continued to argue the shooting was not justified, with Aderrien's mother, Nakala, pushing for footage from the incident to be publicly released. The newly released 911 recordings raise questions about whether Mr Capers knew there was a child in the house when he and another officer responded to domestic disturbance calls placed by Ms Murry's mother, who was not there, and then by Aderrien. A man later identified as John Nolden, the father of one of Ms Murry's other children, had shown up unexpectedly at the home in the early hours of the morning. That led a frightened Ms Murry to give her son a cell phone and ask him to call for help, first by informing his grandmother and then by calling 911. Last Friday, in response to Ms Murry's repeated pleas, state officials released body camera footage of the moments leading up to the shooting of Aderrien. The video shows Mr Capers approaching the Murry home with a colleague, repeatedly banging on the front door and - with permission from the 911 dispatcher - unsuccessfully attempting to kick it open. When Ms Murry opens the door, he is heard twice shouting: ""Let me see your hands."" Ms Murry immediately complies. ""Where's he at?"" Mr Capers then asks twice. As Ms Murry gestures inside the home with her head, he asks her to come out of the house and she steps outside. The officer is then heard repeatedly asking the intruder to come out, adding ""don't make us come in"". He also asks if the man is armed, to which Ms Murry appears to respond that he is not. As Mr Capers enters the empty living room, Aderrien walks into the frame with his hands over his head. Mr Capers immediately opens fire, shoots him in the chest and then says ""Oh, my god"". As the boy screams in pain and runs out the door yelling for his mother, the officer begins calling for an ambulance on his dispatch radio. ""What did I do?"" Aderrien is said to have asked his mother after being shot. ""I don't want to die."" He spent four days recovering in a local hospital, during which he was placed on a ventilator and given a chest tube. Sharing his story for the first time in May with Good Morning America (GMA), the child described feeling like he had been struck by ""a big punch to the chest"". He also said he had previously wanted to be a police officer but changed his mind after the shooting. In a December GMA interview, Mr Capers, who is also black, said the shooting was ""spur of the moment"" and ""definitely wasn't intentional"". National law enforcement statistics suggest domestic disturbance calls are dangerous for US police, often leading to officer assaults and even deaths. Experts say that puts them on high alert. Carlos Moore, an attorney representing the Murry family, said in a statement that the video footage ""allows the world to independently assess whether the actions of Greg Capers were justified"". After the MBI declined to release copies of Aderrien's 911 call, saying that it would violate state law, Mr Moore released the tapes himself on Thursday. The five minutes of audio detail four separate 911 calls, including the first from Aderrien's grandmother and the one placed by the boy himself. The tapes suggest that the 911 dispatcher may not have conveyed to Mr Capers and his colleague that there was a boy inside the house and it was he who called for help. ""The audio recordings reveal that one caller advised the police that no weapons were involved, and another caller advised that there was a child in the house,"" Mr Moore said in a statement to The Enterprise-Tocsin local newspaper. ""This crucial information should have been known to the responding officers and should have informed their approach to the situation."" The city has so far declined to comment on either the video or audio releases. The Murry family is currently suing the city and its police force for $5m (£3.9m). The civil rights suit calls for Mr Capers and Indianola Police Chief Ronald Sampson to be fired. It alleges the responding officers acted with gross negligence and reckless disregard ""so outrageous that it shocks the moral and legal conscience of the community"". Indianola police were not immediately available for comment.","['United States', 'Mississippi']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10DE0/production/_132288096_22bbf4c3-d494-4d14-acd4-24a1dae1fc38.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15C00/production/_132288098_screenshot-102.png']","['By Sam Cabral', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67955729,Strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen show war in Gaza has already spread,It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened.,2024-01-12,"It is time to stop talking about the risk that the war in Gaza will spread elsewhere in the Middle East. It has already happened. Hopes for containing what is happening rest on the fact that it is still relatively low-level, compared to the worst-case scenarios of regional war. The US and British attacks on the Houthis in Yemen are not just, as ministers in London have suggested, about the freedom of navigation and world trade. They are directly linked to events in Gaza and represent an escalation of the crisis that is gripping the region. The Houthis immediately vowed to respond. It is also entirely possible that pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria will increase the action they are taking against the American forces in the region. If that theatre heats up more, and US forces retaliate, it will be harder for the American diplomacy effort to avert all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political movement backed by Iran. The Houthis are also part of the network of allies and proxies, the so-called axis of resistance, that Iran has constructed to give it forward defence against its enemies. They are getting increasingly sophisticated weapons from Iran, but it is best to think of them as allies rather than Tehran's proxy. I have spent quite a bit of time with the Houthis in Yemen and they are people who are highly independently minded. They will relish conflict with the Americans. They want to be part of this war. What has been happening suits both the Houthis and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has beefed up their capabilities and the kind of firepower that the Houthis have at their disposal. That includes anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles they have fired at Israel as well as attack drones - the same sort that Iran supplies to Russia to use against Ukraine. They are well-armed. It is nothing like the naval capacity that they are facing from the US, UK and other members of the coalition the Americans have assembled in the Red Sea. But the threat the Houthis pose is less about the physical damage they might cause and more about the danger to international navigation. In December, they hijacked a ship and forced it into one of their ports. They have also fired directly at ships and caused some damage, although they have not sunk any vessels. Commercial shipping companies who want to get their valuable cargoes through the narrow Bab al-Mandab Strait at the mouth of Red Sea do not want to have hostile forces firing at them. Because of the risks, the insurance costs will rocket, and that's why so many companies are now choosing to detour along the west coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, the shortcut between Asia and Europe that routes ships down the Red Sea and through Bab al-Mandab. The Houthis have controlled Sanaa, Yemen's capital, and big parts of the country including the Red Sea coast since 2014. In 2015, Saudi Arabia led a coalition, also including the United Arab Emirates, that went to war to try to overthrow them. The Saudis said the intervention in Yemen's civil war was to re-establish the country's legitimate and internationally recognised government, which the Houthis had overthrown. But a few days after the intervention started, I spoke to very senior Saudis who told me it was to stop Iran from operating in their back yard. Yemen has a frontier with Saudi Arabia. The Houthis were then bombed by the Saudis from 2015 until the ceasefire came in over a year ago, so a fresh round of strikes is unlikely to intimidate them - they are used to it. I don't think one single round of air strikes is going to do more than make them think yes, we are on the right track. They want to be seen as a fearless resistance to America and its Western allies, who also back Israel. The Houthis have said that they are carrying out these attacks in the Red Sea because of the war in Gaza, the killing of civilians and the severe privations Israel has imposed by blocking all but a fraction of the food and relief supplies that they need to survive. They have said that if the war in Gaza ended and if supplies were permitted to enter, then they wouldn't be threatening a major international shipping lane. Some critics of the American and British support for Israel say that an immediate ceasefire in Gaza would be a much better way to stop the Houthi attacks than bombing them. If Houthi attacks continued after a ceasefire, the argument is that air strikes against them would have increased legitimacy. There is the possibility that this US-UK action could prolong or escalate the situation with the Houthis, rather than shutting it down. Last November, when the Houthis made their first moves in the wider Gaza war with their first attacks on merchant shipping off the Yemen coast, I spoke to Mohammed Ali Al Houthi, one of the leading members of their organisation. He was very defiant then and I am absolutely certain the Houthis will continue to be defiant now. They will want to carry out more attacks, to show that they are defiant and unbeaten. The US and UK attacks hit many different locations. While it is not possible to know the Houthis' precise military capacity, it seems unlikely that one round of strikes will have taken it out. Regular bombardment by the Saudis since 2015 did not appear to have had a significant impact on their capacity. Yemen is a mountainous country. Given their experience of being bombed it is likely they will have tried to hide things away. Iran presumably has sent advisers and trainers to Yemen to help them operate the weapons they have supplied, and they too will have thought about ways of surviving attacks. We can gauge the way that Iran has upgraded the Houthi arsenal by looking at the kind of weapons they are firing out of Yemen. They are more sophisticated, more lethal and therefore more of a threat. When the Houthis took over a merchant ship last month, video of their attack showed well-trained commandoes landing from a helicopter. They are more formidable than the images we often see on TV, of groups of raggedly dressed men waving Kalashnikovs. Compared to the force the US and UK can wield there is no comparison, but that isn't the point in this kind of warfare. If the Houthis, who have supporters across the region, are able to continue to threaten and fire on ships in some way then they will signal to their followers that they are not bowed by the West. More retaliation from the US and its allies is certain if the Houthis do not do as they are told.","['United States', 'Jeremy Bowen', 'Houthis', 'Military']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E52C/production/_132286685_b854f176f7971ac71e5d930b53eec812c40d23900_0_5500_36671000x667.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0A80/production/_132288620_yemen_gaza_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E798/production/_132288295_82b9db8aec50a86c8f49a60d1a13ce3b947bdbcf0_147_4385_24661000x563.jpg']","['By Jeremy Bowen', 'BBC international editor']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67959375,Progressive Democrats fume over Houthi strikes as Republicans offer rare praise,Progressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.,2024-01-12,"Progressive Democrats have harshly criticised the US decision to launch retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. They argued, with support from some Republicans, that President Joe Biden violated the US Constitution by not seeking congressional approval first. But several Republicans offered rare praise of the administration, calling it an ""overdue"" act of deterrence. The president on Thursday called the precision strikes a ""defensive action"". In a joint statement with coalition partners - the UK, Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands - the White House said it had acted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, consistent with the UN charter"". Though Mr Biden notified Congress prior to the strikes launched on 16 Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, he did not seek its authorisation. Several progressives in the president's party fumed that his actions violated Article I of the Constitution, which requires that the power to declare war be granted by Congress. ""This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution,"" Pramila Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The President needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another middle east conflict,"" said California Congressman Ro Khanna. ""I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House."" ""The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians,"" added Missouri's Cori Bush. ""Stop the bombing and do better by us."" Even some Republicans added their voice of disapproval. ""I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?"" asked Rep Chip Roy of Texas. US presidents, from Barack Obama to Donald Trump, have often carried out strikes without first seeking congressional approval. After Mr Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani, Mr Biden argued that presidents ""should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people"". But under the Biden administration, the US military has previously launched strikes in Syria and Iraq without going to Congress. Experts say the legal justification lies with the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) resolution passed by Congress in 2001, which the US has used to justify various troop deployments and counter-terrorism operations around the world over the past two decades. Even without the AUMF resolution in effect, some have argued another piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, grants a president broad powers to take military action. Despite the criticism from some elements of Congress, top Republicans and Democrats have backed Mr Biden's decision. ""I welcome the US and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday night. ""President Biden's decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue,"" the top Republican added. Ben Cardin, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, agreed. ""I support President Biden's decision to take precise action against these increasingly dangerous provocations that have threatened the interests of the US and our allies, and welcome our coalition partners taking these actions with us,"" Mr Cardin said. Senior administration officials have made clear that an attack on an American commercial vessel, being escorted by US military vessels on Tuesday, was the tipping point for Thursday night's action. Twenty drones and three missiles were shot down and, had that not happened, officials say the ships could have been sunk, including one that was carrying jet fuel. The fact that this action was clearly telegraphed in both Washington and London is a clear indication that the US and UK governments, along with the other members of what officials in Washington DC call ""a coalition of the willing"" wanted to minimise any collateral damage and loss of life: degrading facilities and capabilities was, they say, their aim. The Pentagon is expected to give further details of the battle damage assessment in the coming hours and days, but one senior administration official said indications were that they had had ""good effects"". The concern in Washington has always been the escalation of the Gaza conflict to the wider region, and officials continue to stress that this is their key aim. But they are also acutely aware of the potential commercial damage to the world economy should shipping continue to come under fire in the route through the Red Sea and the Suez canal. In his statement on Thursday, Mr Biden said he ""will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary"".","['Iran-US relations', 'Yemen', 'Joe Biden', 'United States', 'Houthis']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EDC/production/_132288102_gettyimages-1556765674.jpg'],"[""By Sam Cabral and Gary O'Donoghue"", 'BBC News, Washington']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67955727,What we know about strikes on Houthis and strategy behind them,The US and UK have carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen with the aim of deterring attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea.,2024-01-12,"The US and UK have carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen with the aim of deterring attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea. The strikes were also backed by a number of the US and UK's allies. Missiles were launched overnight into Friday, hitting dozens of sites - with some casualties reported. The Houthis say they are not deterred by the attacks, but the US suggests the strikes have damaged the rebel group's military capability. But the group has survived much worse - including years of being targeted by the Saudi Air Force. This is what we know about the US-UK strikes so far. The US says it ""executed deliberate strikes on over 60 targets at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations"". The Pentagon described its targets as radar systems, drone storage and launch sites, missile storage and launch facilities and Houthi command and control nodes. Strikes were reported in the Yemen capital Sanaa - which is controlled by the rebels - as well as the Houthi Red Sea port of Hodeidah, Dhamar and the group's north-western stronghold of Saada. According to the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD), the British strikes were in Bani in the north-west - which the MoD said was a drone operational site - and Abbs airfield, which intelligence said was a launching site for missiles and drones. There were 72 strikes in all, according to the Houthis' military spokesman. The Houthi spokesman also said five of its members had been killed and six others injured. The Pentagon said the strikes were on military, not civilian targets using ""precision weapons"". US President Joe Biden has said he won't hesitate to take further military action if necessary. But the US has also made clear that it does not want to see a widening conflict in the Middle East. That suggests that any future US-led military action, if necessary, would again be limited. Air strikes and long range cruise missiles are the least risky and costly for Mr Biden in an election year. Remember the US has been also using limited airstrikes to target other Iranian backed groups in Iraq and Syria in recent months. But at best it's a deterrent. It will not eliminate the threat. The strikes last night might also have degraded and destroyed some of the Houthi's ability to launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. But in public, at least, they remain defiant. They still have the capacity to launch further attacks. The only real option left for the US and UK is then doing more of the same - targeting from a distance. The US has bitter recent experience of more direct military action in the region -  such as putting boots on the ground. The bulk of the firepower came from US jets. The US has an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, as well as air bases in the region. US Navy warships fired Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, which are GPS-guided and can be programmed to fly evasively, the US military says. While no specific figures have been given for how many missiles were fired, the US says more than 100 precision-guided munitions ""of various types"" were used. Meanwhile, the UK said it sent four RAF Typhoons from Cyprus, carrying Paveway IV guided bombs. It has not said how many were released. Though the Royal Navy has two warships in the Red Sea, neither can fire land attack missiles and so would not have been directly involved in the strikes. Reacting to Friday's strikes, the group's leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said the US and UK would ""soon realise"" the action was ""the greatest folly in their history"". ""America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences,"" he wrote on social media, adding ""every individual in this world is faced with two choices - either to stand with the victims of genocide or to stand with its perpetrators."" Another spokesman for the group said the US and UK were wrong to think they could deter Yemen's support for Palestinians. Iran, which backs the Houthis, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a ""clear violation of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and a violation of international laws. A US senior administration official at the National Security Council said in a call on Thursday that ""Iran is a primary, if not the primary enabler or supporter sponsor of the Houthis"", adding that they believe Iran has been ""involved in every phase"" of these attacks. The Houthis' position on the Red Sea attacks is that they are preventing ships affiliated with Israel from crossing the route - due to events in Gaza. They have previously said that any ship destined for Israel or with Israeli links is a ""legitimate target"". However, many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection. ""They are firing indiscriminately on vessels with global ties,"" the US National Security Council official said. ""Most of the ships that have come under attack have nothing whatsoever to do with Israel."" Mr Biden said the strikes were in ""direct response"" to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. ""These attacks have endangered US personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardised trade, and threatened freedom of navigation,"" he said. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak added that the action was ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect global shipping. ""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week,"" he said. ""This cannot stand."" The US-UK attacks were backed by a coalition of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea. The National Security Council official said ""close calls"", one which recently nearly sunk a ship carrying US jet fuel, has caused ""over a dozen shipping companies"" to reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing costs and affecting the global economy. In a statement, the allies said the multilateral strikes were conducted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence"". ""These precision strikes were intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of international mariners in one of the world's most critical waterways,"" the statement read.","['Yemen', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Military', 'United States', 'Houthis']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0A80/production/_132288620_yemen_gaza_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C86D/production/_132290315_strikes_in_yemen_v2_640-nc-2x-nc.png']","['By Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent, and Jacqueline Howard', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67948573,US election 2024: Can Nikki Haley really stop Donald Trump?,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat.",2024-01-12,"Donald Trump remains the overwhelming favourite for the Republican presidential nomination, but Nikki Haley is surging. If the former president shows any signs of weakness when voting begins next week, her long-shot bid could become a real threat. On a snowy morning in Iowa this week, in the middle of an Irish pub, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was giving her stump speech: a tight 13 minutes on spending cuts, education reform and a secure southern border. At the heart of her pitch was this: a Haley presidency would be a return to normalcy, a drama-free alternative to the current frontrunner, former president Donald Trump. ""Don't you want that again? Because we could have that again,"" she said. The line won the loudest applause of the morning from the hundred-odd voters who had braved the icy roads to hear her speak in Waukee, on the edge of the state capital Des Moines. Eleven months into her candidacy, Ms Haley, 51, seems to finally have the wind at her back. Heading into the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first contest in the 2024 Republican race, the former South Carolina governor has claimed a series of well-timed victories - consolidating support from deep-pocketed donors, racking up endorsements and steadily advancing in the polls. ""She's engaging, she's smart, she's personable and I think she has a vision of where we should be 10 years from now,"" said Haley supporter Doug Stout after watching her speak on Tuesday. The vision was for the ""shining city on the hill"" type of Republican Party, he said. ""The one I grew up with."" The unfortunate reality for the Haley campaign, however, is that not enough voters seem to be buying that vision. Most polls, including in Iowa, suggest Mr Trump maintains a lead of around 30 points. Observers say Nikki Haley is running a campaign for the wrong era of Republican politics: that her candidacy ignores the reality of the modern Republican party, whose base has turned so definitively toward Mr Trump that the establishment-friendly conservatism favoured by Ms Haley no longer makes sense. ""Ms Haley's campaign represents a misunderstanding of where the base is and what the base wants,"" said Gunner Ramer, political director for the Republican Accountability Project. ""To those that want the old Republican party back, Haley is offering a very attractive candidacy. But there aren't enough Republicans out there who do."" So what exactly is her game plan? Ms Haley's allies say both privately and publicly that she is playing to win. They insist that as the field narrows, and Ms Haley becomes the clear alternative to Mr Trump, she will pull ahead, propelled by moderates and a growing swathe of Republican voters who have tired of the former president, or are concerned about his chances in the general election. In Iowa, Ms Haley looks poised to swipe the second place spot from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. At a Wednesday evening debate between the two, Ms Haley strained to position herself as Mr Trump's sole rival. ""I wish Donald Trump was on this stage. He's the one I'm running against,"" she said. Campaign aides told the BBC that the goal for Ms Haley in Iowa is simple: build momentum. A strong showing, they said, would carry her into New Hampshire - where polls with Mr Trump are much tighter - and then on to South Carolina, her home state. Ms Haley may be helped by the sudden exit of anti-Trump candidate, Chris Christie, who suspended his campaign this week. Supporters of the former New Jersey Governor, surveys suggest, are most likely to flock to her. Less helpful was Mr Christie's hot-mic moment, when he was caught saying she would ""get smoked"", presumably by Mr Trump. ""She's not up to this,"" he said. Long-time observers counter that Ms Haley has a knack for defying expectations. ""If you look at her career, a lot of people have underestimated her and a lot of people have been wrong,"" said Randy Covington, a veteran journalist from South Carolina. Even her critics acknowledge that she is a master of retail politics - the door-knocking and handshaking that delivered her to the statehouse in 2005. She stunned her own party in the primary by unseating Larry Koon, then the longest-serving member of the House. At the time, Ms Haley had no political experience and was a bookkeeper for her family's clothing shop. Nearly 20 years later, the state representative-turned-governor-turned-UN-ambassador still likes to introduce herself first as an accountant. She points out that she is a mom of two, the wife of a combat veteran and the child of Indian immigrants, running to make her family proud. In televised debates, in pancake houses and town halls, Ms Haley pauses mid-speech for a smile and pointed eye contact. She's a down-home American hard at work for your vote. ""She connects, she has the X factor,"" said David Wilkins, a former South Carolina House speaker who led Ms Haley's transition to the governor's house. ""The more people who are exposed to her, the more support she's going to get, it's just that simple."" Ms Haley's campaign often looks and sounds like something out of 2012: more compromise and pragmatism, fewer grievances and conspiracy theories. She is a staunch conservative, but she speaks with nuance on hot button issues like abortion and immigration, and is less eager to wade into the country's culture wars. In Iowa this week, it was clear this was central to her appeal. Voters said they valued Ms Haley's tone and her civility - a clear departure from Mr Trump, who spent part of this week in a federal appeals court for one of the four separate criminal cases he now faces. ""She's boring,"" one Iowan said of Ms Haley, before quickly clarifying he meant it as a compliment. ""We need to get out of the era of politics that is dominated by what someone tweeted."" Polls suggest Ms Haley's measured approach could make her the most formidable opponent to President Joe Biden in November's general election. ""Trump is head-to-head with Biden on a good day,"" she said this week, before citing a Wall Street Journal poll from late last year. ""I defeat Biden by 17 points."" But she has to defeat Mr Trump first. ""This is still the party of Donald Trump, until the Republican party says otherwise,"" said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa Republican political consultant. At least one-third of Republican primary voters are thought to be in the ""always Trump"" camp - a group both devoted to the former president and repelled by the establishment politics embodied by Ms Haley. ""I think she's just more of the same… and Trump isn't,"" said Mike Williams, an Iowa resident. ""I want someone who's a bit of an outsider."" The vice-like grip Mr Trump has on the party doesn't give Ms Haley much room for manoeuvre. She needs to appeal to two very different groups of Republicans: the ""never Trumpers"" who despise the former president, as well as those who still like him but worry he will lose to Biden. She has to distance herself from him without alienating his supporters who might yet be persuaded to back someone else. Ms Haley has been cautious in her criticism of her old boss. At a televised town hall in Iowa, a prospective backer sheepishly admitted he had voted for Mr Trump twice. ""Me too,"" she quipped, beaming. In nearly every speech, she performs a tightly rehearsed juggling act. Mr Trump ""was the ""right president at the right time"", she'll say. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him"". Those close to Ms Haley shot down the suggestion that she may eventually join his ticket as the vice-presidential nominee - something the Trump campaign has also dismissed. But Ms Haley has said yes to him before, when she became his ambassador at the United Nations. Mr Trump, for his part, has turned his ire increasingly on Ms Haley, whom he dubbed ""birdbrain"" in September. ""She is a globalist,"" he said last week. ""She likes the globe. I like America first."" The escalating critiques are perhaps the clearest sign that the frontrunner is taking her campaign seriously. Some Trump aides have also been downplaying expectations of a blowout victory in Iowa. The Republican race will not be decided this month. But the upcoming votes in Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first test of whether Mr Trump's power is as strong as it seems. If not, Ms Haley will be waiting in the wings.","['Nikki Haley', 'Donald Trump', 'US election 2024', 'United States', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED42/production/_132283706_nikkismiling.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/FB9C/production/_90021446_grey_line_new.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7812/production/_132283703_nikkitop.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4AE/production/_132283626_ronandnikki.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F5DA/production/_132283926_gettyimages-1926034122.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By Holly Honderich', 'in Des Moines, Iowa']",World,US & Canada

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67954161,US and UK strikes target Houthi rebels in Yemen,US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen.,2024-01-12,"US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen. US officials say warship-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles and fighter jets hit 16 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold. The strikes are in response to repeated attacks by the Iran-backed group on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who back Hamas, said at least five of their number were killed. The group claims to be targeting ships linked to Israel - saying the attacks are in response to Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip - and have also launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel. The Houthi targets in Yemen early on Friday included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots, US officials told the Associated Press news agency. US President Joe Biden, quoted by Reuters news agency, said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes against Houthi targets with support from countries including Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. ""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" Mr Biden said. He added that he ""will not hesitate"" to order further military action if necessary. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in response that there was ""absolutely no justification"" for the attacks and that the group would continue to target Israeli ships. Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah - both Houthi allies - have also condemned the strikes. These are the first such actions by the US military in the Red Sea since the Houthi drone and missile attacks on shipping began in November. The Houthis, who control a large part of Yemen, have been targeting merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with missiles and drones - putting lives at risk, threatening the global economy and destabilising the region. Four RAF Typhoon jets flying from Akrotiri in Cyprus also conducted air strikes on two Houthi targets in Yemen using Paveway bombs, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the strikes in a statement on Friday morning, calling them ""limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"". Mr Sunak denounced the ""reckless actions"" of the Houthi militia, who he said had carried out a series of ""dangerous and destabilising attacks"" against commercial shipping in the Red Sea despite repeated warnings from the international community. He added that the UK would ""always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade"". On 9 January, HMS Diamond, along with US warships, successfully repelled the largest attack from the Houthis in the Red Sea to date. On the same day, the Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel - the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December. The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.","['United States', 'Houthis', 'Military']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0AB2/production/_132283720_mediaitem132283719.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14059/production/_132290028_strikes_in_yemen_v2_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0A80/production/_132288620_yemen_gaza_640-nc-2x-nc.png']",,World,US & Canada

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67953895,Donald Trump turns his legal battles into campaign spectacle,"Appearing in court in New York at the end of the civil fraud case against the Trump Organization on Thursday, Donald Trump insisted on having his say.",2024-01-12,"Appearing in court in New York at the end of the civil fraud case against the Trump Organization on Thursday, Donald Trump insisted on having his say. The judge had previously said the former president would not be able to speak in the courtroom but eventually relented and gave him a few minutes. He used that platform to accuse the city's attorney general of hating him before striding out of the courtroom and declaring the case a ""sham"" to waiting reporters. But that wasn't enough. A full news conference followed at a building he owns - and is accused of fraudulently valuing - at 40 Wall Street down the road. Mr Trump is treating his court appearances as though they are campaign events, blending his legal defence with his re-election bid as a US presidential race like no other kicks into high gear. His legal headaches across the country are, in his telling, all part of a plan by Joe Biden, the Democrats and the White House to stop him winning the 2024 election. Thursday's appearance in New York followed hot on the heels of another in Washington earlier in the week. The former president made a personal appearance at a federal appeals court where his lawyers argued that he could not be tried for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. As his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination have been criss-crossing Iowa ahead of the first voting contest on Monday, the former president has been claiming that he is being dragged off the campaign trail by the judiciary. ""TWICE in this final week, I will reportedly be forced off the campaign trail and into courtrooms for phony witch hunts in both New York and Washington DC,"" he wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. In fact, he did not have to attend either of these hearings. He deliberately chose to appear in two separate courtrooms because he believes that his campaign gets a significant boost every time he is seen in court. And he's right. The Republican frontrunner has successfully transformed his multiple legal problems into his greatest political asset. At rallies, news conferences and in emails and text messages to voters and donors, he claims to be the victim of politically motivated prosecutions orchestrated to try to stop him getting back into the White House. The indictments against him, he tells supporters, aren't a source of shame but a ""badge of honour"". He claims the various cases he faces are not just an effort to target him but also the 50% or so of America that supports him. A familiar line from his political stump speech is: ""They are not after me. They're after you. I'm just standing in their way."" That framing of 91 criminal charges - a charge sheet that would have long sunk any ordinary candidate - has proved to be a very effective way of drawing his base into this battle right alongside him. It has given the Trump campaign a mission and a purpose ahead of what looks like a likely rematch against President Joe Biden in November. Mr Trump's legal travails also help to ensure his campaign machinery is greased with the right amount of cash. His bid for re-election only started to build momentum after the first criminal indictment against him in New York last April. Fundraising emails were sent just minutes after news of the charges related to hush money payments to former porn star Stormy Daniels broke in the media. More than $4m (£3.1m) was reportedly raised in the following 24 hours. After his second indictment in June - on federal criminal changes of mishandling classified documents - the money again poured in. Some $6.6m in a matter of days was reported to have been raised by his campaign. By the time that iconic mugshot was taken when he was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, in August - on charges of plotting to overturn the state's 2020 election results - he had perfected the art of making a spectacle out of each indictment. The campaign brought TV crews with him on his private plane and inside his motorcade to broadcast his every move, live. Speaking in Washington this week, he claimed that he was only being prosecuted because opinion polls show he is currently leading President Biden. According to most polls, the race is neck and neck. ""I think they feel this is the way they are going to try to and win, and that's not the way it goes,"" Mr Trump said. He predicted there would be ""bedlam"" in the country if the criminal cases against him prevented his re-election. The White House has been on the counter-offensive. President Biden used his first major speech of this year on 6 January to warn of the fundamental threat he says Mr Trump poses to American democracy. This argument - which leans heavily on reminding Americans of what happened when Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol three years ago- will be a major plank of the Democrat's campaign, which is otherwise struggling to cut through on its positive message about the US economy and that inflation is coming down. But Mr Trump has already turned the argument on its head for his supporters. In Trump's world, Mr Biden is ""the true destroyer of democracy"". But the mood - particularly among independents - may change when any of the trials Mr Trump is facing actually get under way. The 6 January case is particularly perilous for the former president. Voters will hear detailed evidence about how Mr Trump tried to cling on to power after losing the 2020 election. Polls suggest a conviction in that case - and the potential implication of prison time - could become a significant political disadvantage. But Mr Trump has a strategy for that too. Delay, delay and delay with as many motions and appeals as possible to try and make sure no trial begins until after the election on 5 November. Because if he returns to the Oval Office after that he will simply instruct his justice department to drop the cases or even - if he's been convicted - try to pardon himself.","['Donald Trump', 'Indictments of Donald Trump', 'US politics', 'US election 2024', 'United States']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AE5E/production/_132283644_gettyimages-1925496195.jpg'],"['By Sarah Smith', 'North America editor']",World,US & Canada

The network has said the ploy was ""a misguided attempt"" to recognise on-air talent that were not eligible for certain categories. The awards won were reportedly re-engraved with the real names of the on-air personalities. The sports network has apologised. Details of the ploy were first uncovered in a report on Thursday by sports publication The Athletic. The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS), the organisation behind the Emmys, told The Athletic that it had ""identified a number of fictitious credits submitted by ESPN to multiple Sports Emmys competitions"". NATAS then notified ESPN's senior management of this finding, who has since apologised and reprimanded those who were responsible. The Athletic's report centred around ESPN's ""College GameDay"" programme, which nabbed eight Emmys for Outstanding Weekly Studio Show between 2008 and 2018. Until 2023, that category prohibited submissions from on-air talent in an effort to avoid duplicate wins for a single programme. On-air personalities could instead submit for other categories, like Outstanding Host or Emerging On-Air Talent. In a bid to secure awards for their on-air talent, the network reportedly circumvented eligibility rules by submitting entries with fake names credited for the programme. The fake names were similar to those of the on-air personalities, with the same initials but slightly altered. There is no evidence suggesting the on-air personalities were aware of the submissions or the ploy. In a statement to the BBC, ESPN spokesperson Julie McKay said the ploy involved award submissions that may date back as far back as 1997. ""This was a misguided attempt to recognize on-air individuals who were important members of our production team, "" Ms McKay said in an email.  ""Once current leadership was made aware, we apologized to [The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences] for violating guidelines."" Ms McKay said the network has brought in outside counsel to conduct ""a full and thorough investigation."" She added those who were responsible were disciplined by ESPN. Along with being forced to return the statuettes, NATAS said it has also imposed a one-year disqualification from award eligibility for the senior leadership of ""College GameDay"".","['United States', 'Emmy Awards']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15FB6/production/_132283009_gettyimages-1243175519.jpg'],"['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",World,US & Canada

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered. Set in mature woodlands, an orchard and rolling fields, it sits behind electric gates and is framed by a stone-walled, Italianate garden. It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing."" Mr Maher also has two sons, aged 32 and 27, and a grandchild, aged two, from his first marriage. He has been working in the IT industry for the past 25 years and his wife Amanda, 54, is a school administrative assistant. He said he was ""overjoyed"" when he learned of his win. ""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires."" Omaze said the draw also raised £3.5m for the RSPCA, the UK's largest and oldest animal welfare charity. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years. Justice Cavanagh said in his sentencing remarks that Alfie had been the victim of a ""frenzied attack"" in which he suffered about 50 injuries on the night of his death. He said to Hedges: ""You were Alfie's mother and he deserved your protection."" Sam Phillips, Alfie's father, described him as ""good as gold"" and ""lively"", adding he had been ""robbed of the opportunity to see him grown up"". ""The funeral was one of the hardest days of my lives. The images of his tiny coffin will stay with me forever,"" he said. Hedges, of Yelverton, Devon, and Benham, killed Alfie overnight during lockdown in Benham's caravan in Hernhill, near Faversham. During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body. The court heard that on the night before Alfie died, Hedges went to buy drugs from their friend and repay her £400 debt, and also get mixers and drinks for their evening together in the caravan. Benham told police he bit Alfie on his back and shook him the morning he found him unresponsive in an attempt to rouse him, the jury heard. The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner. Asked if she had seen Mr Benham murder Alfie, she replied: ""No."" Mark Demain, Alfie's grandfather, said the toddler ""completed our lives"". ""We have never experience pain like this. I would describe it as if the light in our souls have gone out,"" he said. ""Our best friend, our grandson was so cruelly taken from us. Every day we are hurting."" Jurors previously heard about older injuries Alfie sustained in the months prior to his death and their explanations for them, such as a cut under his eye from playing with keys and his fingers being caught in the dog gate in Benham's parents' home. One incident was described in which Hedges described finding blood on the carpet, a cushion and a tissue, but was told Alfie had fallen and hit his mouth on the oil heater. Benham had described how he held Alfie above him but he slipped out of his hands and hit his nose on Benham's teeth, the court heard. Ms Hedges said she was not there and was unaware it had happened. When the pair were found guilty, Det Ch Insp Kathleen Way, of Kent Police, said the verdict would ""not bring Alfie back"", but would mean that ""Hedges and Benham lose their right to freedom and life as they know it"". ""Alfie should have been protected and loved by his mum, instead Hedges and Benham inflicted unimaginable suffering on him during a sustained and lengthy night of violence,"" she added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-67958022,Former Lancashire policeman jailed over 'jealous rage' attack,"A police officer who brutally attacked his ex-girlfriend in a ""jealous rage"" has been jailed.",2024-01-12,"A police officer who brutally attacked his ex-girlfriend in a ""jealous rage"" has been jailed. James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Daisy Bull died in December after being diagnosed with cancer in her kidney three years ago. Hundreds of people stood by the side of roads in Retford in Nottinghamshire to pay their respects to Daisy. Part of the seven-mile route went past Daisy's school, where the children applauded as Daisy's coffin and the convoy went past. Daisy's mum, Sally Bull, said her daughter ""was something else"". ""She was a little bit different from your average 12-year-old,"" Mrs Bull said. ""She loved lorries and went everywhere with her dad in his lorry."" Daisy came from a family of lorry drivers, and her mum thinks she would have grown up to be a professional lorry driver too. Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December. Nick Bull, Daisy's father, said she ""fought so hard and won the first two battles but wasn't strong enough to win the war"". Daisy's coffin was on the back of a green and white Scania 730, driven by her dad, who runs a haulage company. Daisy's uncle drove the lorry behind, and her cousin drove another lorry.

Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood. Ms James added she had acquired Dugee from someone who bought an emu egg online and hatched it at their home. Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November.

John Heath's wife, Helen, ran a Post Office in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and was one of hundreds of people accused in the Post Office scandal. ""She [Helen] died not knowing whether it was a member of her family that was stealing from her [or] one of her friends who were our employees. ""She had no idea. She carried that to her grave and that is unforgivable."" More than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software, called Horizon, made it look like money was missing from their branches. ""The Post Office destroyed my family,"" said Mr Heath, who lives in Melksham. He explained the software installed in the branch ""would come out with random figures"" when his wife tried to balance the books each Wednesday. When they phoned the helpline they were always told 'you're the only people having this problem'. Mr Heath's daughter, Vikki, said: ""The big tragedy in our family situation is that my mum went to her grave thinking that people were stealing and that is awful. ""That is something that me and my family will have to live with."" Following a campaign by former postmaster Alan Bates - recently dramatised for ITV - Mr Heath realised they were not alone. He said that following his wife's death he was appointed to run the branch without any training. He and his son, who also worked there, had ""exactly the same problems"" as his wife. Ms Heath explained that her father had ""suffered hugely"". ""He has had two strokes since the whole thing started. His mental and physical health has deteriorated hugely,"" she said. Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"". Fujitsu, which developed the software at the heart of the affair, said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

When she was first questioned, Mrs Oluwa said her daughter was with her, but inquiries revealed she was at school. She then told the council she had used the Blue Badge as she had no money to pay for parking.A council spokesperson said: ""By misusing the Blue Badge on this occasion, to avoid paying for £2 parking, Mrs Oluwa now has a criminal record and has been ordered to pay £979.""

Bob Child, 79, who ran a post office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, said he personally repaid £600 when the books would not balance 20 years ago. He remembered getting calls from other sub-postmasters who were worried about the same financial issues. He said at the time he had not made the link to the introduction of Horizon. ""When we did the books with a pen and paper, you'd occasionally be a few pounds over or under, but nothing much,"" he said. ""In about 2002, a few years after Horizon was introduced, we had a shortfall of £600. I couldn't understand and repaid it with my own money."" Mr Child, who is now retired and living in Little Downham near Ely, added: ""At the end of the day, your contract said you had to make good. ""I would say there must be hundreds of people out there who never went to court because they used their own money to make it up."" He said friends who ran other post offices would call him to tell of similar problems. ""When Horizon came in, we used to cash up on a Wednesday,"" said Mr Child. ""Postmasters were ringing me up at eight o'clock on a Wednesday night, saying, 'Bob, I've got a problem. I can't balance my books. I'm £300 in arrears. What am I going to do?'"" More than 900 workers across the country were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches. Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Victims of the Post Office scandal have been promised swift exoneration and compensation by the government. Mr Child told the BBC: ""It was puzzling but at the time, no-one questioned the system. Funnily, it was always a shortfall. I've never heard of anyone being over."" He said he wondered what had happened to the money he repaid. ""My understanding is that it went into a suspended account,"" he said. ""Then after two or three years, it moved into Post Office accounts."" Mr Child said using the Horizon system was often problematic. ""From the time it came in, it was so slow,"" he said. ""It could take hours to cash up - much longer that when we did it on paper."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

PC Chris Duffy was apprehending Mason Perkins's brother in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March when he was hit by Perkins. The court heard that after the officer fell to the floor, Perkins then also ""pummelled"" his face and body. At Nottingham Crown Court, Perkins was handed an 11-and-a-half year sentence. Warning: A distressing image of PC Duffy's injuries is below PC Duffy, a police dog handler, sustained a ""blow to the head with a relatively heavy object with an edge like a machete, saw or axe"", the court heard on Friday. The officer's injury was described by a forensic pathologist as a ""chop wound"". PC Duffy - who now has a scar from one side of his head to the other - is back on duty. Following an argument at Sunnydale pub, in Mansfield Woodhouse, where Perkins was barred, PC Duffy apprehended Perkins' brother in an alleyway. The court heard Perkins, 25, entered the alleyway and politely asked the officer if he could pass. PC Duffy, believing Perkins was an innocent member of the public, moved to allow him to walk behind. The officer then felt his head being ""violently jolted"" and was thrown to the floor. Perkins next punched and kicked PC Duffy on both sides of the body and face. As the officer got to his feet, Perkins escaped. About 15 minutes later, when PC Duffy was walking back to his car, he spotted Perkins and other officers gave chase and he was arrested. Perkins, of Moor Street, Mansfield, was found with cannabis, scales, and a cannabis grinder on him. Judge Nirmal Shant KC described the officer's injuries as ""grave"". She said: ""You struck the officer when he was not facing you. ""You struck him in a way that jolted him violently on the floor. ""You hit him and punched him and kicked him and bent over him, pummelling him to the side of the face, to the body, then making good your escape."" The judge added the attack had a ""profound effect"" on PC Duffy, saying it had not only left him with physical injuries but psychological injuries too. Perkins had previously admitted grievous bodily harm, supplying cannabis, and offering to supply a Class A drug. Det Sgt Matthew Dumbrell described the attack as ""utterly shocking"" and said the officer was ""fortunate to avoid more serious injuries"". He said: ""I am pleased Perkins will now spend a very considerable length of time in jail, and hope this sentence serves as a warning to others about the consequences of attacking our officers. ""I would also like to place on record my admiration for the officer involved, who in the moments before, during, and after this attack demonstrated so many of the qualities we expect from front-line police officers.""

Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood. Ms James added she had acquired Dugee from someone who bought an emu egg online and hatched it at their home. Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November. Police officers were alerted and helped locate the flightless bird in a residential street close to its home. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckv4474y041o,Funding agreed for European Athletics Championships,,2024-01-12,"The West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) has committed a further £600,000 towards the hosting of the 2026 European Athletics Championships in Birmingham.Financing for the games came into question, after Birmingham City Council declared effective bankruptcy in September.At a meeting on Friday, the combined authority agreed the money, thanks to an underspend from the building of the Sandwell Aquatics Centre.Councillor Bob Sleigh, portfolio lead for finance at the authority, said losing the event would have a ""detrimental impact on the city, region and UK as a whole"". Birmingham City Council had originally agreed to underwrite the full cost of staging the championships at the Alexander Stadium as part of a joint bid with UK Athletics and UK Sport.However commissioners brought in to make £300m of savings at the authority over the next two years have outlined it as a ""non-essential"", Mr Sleigh told the WMCA board meeting. This had led to a £2.2m shortfall in funding for the event, which would be the first time it had been held in the UK. Addressing the meeting, the leader of Birmingham City Council, Councillor John Cotton said it was ""disappointing"" it was no longer able to resource the  shortfall, and appreciated the financial challenges local authorities were under.""We are all facing real difficulties now, notwithstanding that, we cannot allow an event of this magnitude slip through our fingers,"" he said.Without agreeing the new financial plan, he said, there was a real prospect that Birmingham could lose the event.European Athletics, he said, were due to meet on 16 January to formally consider the new plan. As well as £600,000 from the WMCA, the meeting heard, UK Athletics had assigned £250,000 towards the event, with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport agreeing to put forward £680,000 conditional on the authority's contribution.Birmingham City Council will provide £670,000, which has been saved from works on Alexander Stadium. Two amendments to the report were also agreed, that the involvement of the WMCA be recognised and, from Mayor Andy Street, that the authority itself looks into the possibility of adding £3m from its finances towards grassroots sports initiatives, to cover that lost from the refinancing of the championships.Mr Street said:  “It’s really important that major events like this leave a lasting legacy for residents.""That’s why I’ve asked my team to ensure they strain every sinew to protect grassroots and community funding.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67937404,Party: The new-style nightclub that's only open in the day,"If you like a night out but are known to nod off at a bar when it gets late, the day-time nightclub may be for you.",2024-01-12,"If you like a night out but are known to nod off at a bar when it gets late, the day-time nightclub may be for you. Actress Vicky McClure and husband Jonny Owen have created a club night that's open in the day but shuts early so you can get a kebab, the last train and be home for some Saturday night telly. The idea is you'll be fresh to take the kids to their clubs the next morning. ""Instead of dancing the night away, this is dancing the afternoon away,"" joked Line of Duty star Vicky. As a nod to the Bee Gees' party classic Night Fever, the all-day discos are called Day Fever where its more ""all day long"" than ""all night long"". ""It's a nightclub in the afternoon for people of a certain age,"" said filmmaker Jonny, 52. ""I love meeting mates, having a few drinks, having a dance but also like getting a cheeky curry afterwards, not queuing hours for a taxi and being home early enough for Match of the Day - and then it also doesn't ruin your Sunday either. ""For me now, it's all about going out on a bit of an all-dayer - and I thought there's a real market for people with a similar vibe."" The discos are targeted at people over 30, where doors open at 14:00, last entry is 16:00 and party-goers are asked to be polite and encouraged to dress smart like they used to when they went on a night out clubbing. ""I'm really guilty for having a good dance in my kitchen alone - and I would much rather do it with my friends,"" Bafta winner Vicky said. ""Music is such a powerful thing for us all to have, it's one thing playing it in your headphones, your house or in your car but you're on a dance floor, with your mates it really does create a memory - and I'm all for music and memories as we do with our dementia choir."" DJs at their event can include Vicky herself, Jonny, and his daughter Radio 1 presenter Katie Owen who pick from classic party anthems chosen by DJ and Reverend and the Makers frontman Jon McClure. Their first day-time disco experiment in Sheffield City Hall last month sold out within 48 hours where Vicky and mum Carol led the dance floor charge. ""It started in a classic way where everybody stood round the edge of the dance floor,"" said the Trigger Point and Without Sin actress, who had recently been honoured by the King. ""But me and mum were the first two up dancing and it didn't take long before everybody followed - and it was completely packed."" Daytime dances have now been confirmed in London, Nottingham and south Wales as well as a return to Sheffield and organisers want to take their drop-in disco to towns and cities across the UK. ""We'd love to see it in different cities so everyone has access and we're getting loads of messages on our social media asking us to bring it to them,"" she added. ""And having it on your doorstep, close to your home is the whole point so you don't have to make late-night trips on the train, we want to make sure it's accessible to everybody. ""We've got to be really fair about ticket prices because we appreciate the world in which we live in and people want to be able to come and have a great time so we've got to make it affordable to everybody."" Vicky and Jonny's daytime disco includes a nostalgia fix on the big screens which includes clips from old school TV shows and films as well as retro television adverts. ""I'm terrible for scrolling down a nostalgia rabbit hole as we all love that once you get to a certain age,"" added Vicky, 40. An investigation by BBC Newsbeat found that more than half of all UK clubs shut down between 2005 and 2015 and Jonny wants to show that some people still want to dance and party, just a bit earlier than used to. Three of their next events - in Sheffield, Merthyr Tydfil and Nottingham - have already sold out while tickets for their day-time disco in London's Outernet in March are selling well, they said. ""It's better than going to the gym if we're going down the January new year's resolution route,"" said Vicky with a smile.

Heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding has affected growers around the country, including in Lincolnshire.TH Clements, based near Boston, reported that there had only been a handful of dry days since October, which had made harvesting difficult. Commercial director Mr Moulding said the company had lost about 20% of its winter crops.He said: ""It's been a very tough time for us for more than three months both physically and financially in having to pull the vegetables out of the muddy fields.""We have literally had to race against the clock to get the vegetables pulled out of the ground to stop them from rotting.""The flexibility that Tesco has given us has allowed us to maximise the amount of product we can get on their shelves therefore guaranteeing greater availability for shoppers."" In order to dry wet sprouts the retailer has worked with growers to develop a new drying method, using cool air blowers to blow the water from them in their storage pallets.Tom Mackintosh, from the supermarket, said: ""By accepting slightly smaller sprouts, cauliflower, cabbages and leeks, we can support the fresh produce industry while ensuring that customers are able to continue to buy British winter vegetables.""The National Farmers Union said January's poor weather had disrupted the growth of many harvests. Martin Emmett, from the NFU said: ""We have no expectations of shortages currently, but it remains important that we make the best of what’s available with supermarkets offering flexibility to growers when it comes to crop specification. ""In doing so the food chain from farm to plate will avoid unnecessary food waste.""","['NFU', 'Floods', 'Tesco', 'UK farming']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/a65f/live/aca1b220-b142-11ee-a24d-5371dfbad329.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/747b/live/8fded7f0-b145-11ee-a24d-5371dfbad329.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/3dd77680-b143-11ee-a24d-5371dfbad329.jpg']",,UK,England

The series, based on the comedian's own experience of working in a call centre in Bristol, helped launch ITV's new streaming service, ITVX last year. She said other shows use the same landmarks so she ""banned all of that"" to showcase working class Bristol. Ms Adams now hopes the success of the programme will lead to a second series being aired on ITV's main channel. ""Every single Bristol programme has College Green or the Suspension Bridge, like we only have a couple of landmarks,"" said Ms Adams, explaining her show was ""cemented in south Bristol"". She told BBC Points West that as a production they ""really pushed"" to be able to do a call out for local people to become part of the cast. The show had about 8,000 applicants, finally casting 20-year-old Dan Hiscox as security guard Craig. ""I didn't have any representation or anything. I saw this call out on social media,"" said Mr Hiscox. ""I just gave it my best shot."" ""Everyone was great, but he nailed it,"" said Ms Adams, who starred in Strictly Come Dancing in 2022. ""He was brilliant and really felt like he was part of the family that we were creating."" Mr Hiscox said: ""One of my dreams, it's a pretty pathetic dream, was to turn on my local village lights and I did it this year for Christmas. It was glorious.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-67924234,Wolverhampton grandmother’s abusers caught by hidden camera,Two sisters caught four care workers abusing their 89-year-old grandmother after hiding a camera in her bedroom.,2024-01-12,"Two sisters caught four care workers abusing their 89-year-old grandmother after hiding a camera in her bedroom. Danielle Hinsley and her sister Rebecca became suspicious after Beryl Wall's behaviour changed and she began to get bruises on her face and wrists. Like a scene from the hugely popular Netflix drama Fool Me Once, they put a photo frame with a hidden camera in her room at a care home in Wolverhampton. Four days of footage from February 2020 was enough to convict her attackers. It caught the workers shouting in dementia sufferer Mrs Wall's face, making fun of her, holding her legs in the air and hitting her in the face with a pillow. Ame Tunkara, Morounranti Adefila, Danny Ohen and Bridget Aideyan were jailed at the end of 2023. ""Knowing they spent Christmas and new year away from their families is the best punishment,"" Danielle said. The sisters saw their grandmother regularly so quickly spotted her decline. ""We visited nan every day as this happened before lockdown,"" Danielle said. ""Her behaviour had changed, she had bruises. So I went home and ordered a picture frame camera off Amazon and put a picture of me, my sister and my nan in it."" It is the same type of camera millions of viewers have seen actress Michelle Keegan use in Fool Me Once, which is currently Netflix's number one drama worldwide. It is given to her to keep an eye on her daughter's nanny, but captures more than she is expecting. When Danielle viewed the footage several days later, she said it ""broke my heart"". It captured the people who should have been caring for her most mocking Mrs Wall and pinching her face. In much of the footage their grandmother was naked and confused, Danielle said. The sisters took their evidence to the care home managers, the Care Quality Commission and West Midlands Police. Three of the four workers were from an agency and one was a permanent member of staff. Ohen was on his first shift at the home when he was caught on camera intimidating Mrs Wall and hitting her in the face with a pillow. The family does not want to name the care home, which is under new management and whose other staff had been ""amazing"", they said, caring for Mrs Wall until she died in October last year. ""We believe nan waited for the trial to end because she took a turn quite quickly when we told her the verdict,"" Danielle said. ""She was my everything and always will be my everything."" In total, eight care workers were charged for abusing Mrs Wall but only four were found guilty. Tunkara, 33, of Walsall, and Adefila, 43, of Wolverhampton, were found guilty of ill-treatment and wilful neglect and sentenced in December to four months in prison. Ohen, 39, and Aideyan, 49, both from Wolverhampton, were also found guilty of the same offences and sentenced to six months and four months, respectively. Det Con Kathryn Sargent said Mrs Wall did ""not have a voice"" because of her dementia. ""Without the footage we wouldn't have known it was going on let alone prove it happened,"" she said.

John Heath's wife, Helen, ran a Post Office in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and was one of hundreds of people accused in the Post Office scandal. ""She [Helen] died not knowing whether it was a member of her family that was stealing from her [or] one of her friends who were our employees. ""She had no idea. She carried that to her grave and that is unforgivable."" More than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software, called Horizon, made it look like money was missing from their branches. ""The Post Office destroyed my family,"" said Mr Heath, who lives in Melksham. He explained the software installed in the branch ""would come out with random figures"" when his wife tried to balance the books each Wednesday. When they phoned the helpline they were always told 'you're the only people having this problem'. Mr Heath's daughter, Vikki, said: ""The big tragedy in our family situation is that my mum went to her grave thinking that people were stealing and that is awful. ""That is something that me and my family will have to live with."" Following a campaign by former postmaster Alan Bates - recently dramatised for ITV - Mr Heath realised they were not alone. He said that following his wife's death he was appointed to run the branch without any training. He and his son, who also worked there, had ""exactly the same problems"" as his wife. Ms Heath explained that her father had ""suffered hugely"". ""He has had two strokes since the whole thing started. His mental and physical health has deteriorated hugely,"" she said. Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"". Fujitsu, which developed the software at the heart of the affair, said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2qyy0q77ywo,Children’s hospital inundated with measles cases,,2024-01-12,"Birmingham Children’s Hospital has been inundated with the highest number in decades of youngsters with measles, health officials say.Within the last month, there have been more than 50 children in need of treatment, the highest it has seen in years.It comes as UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show the West Midlands had at least 167 laboratory confirmed cases with a further 88 likely cases.A low vaccination rate of about 5% has been attributed to the rise. The UKHSA has confirmed the West Midlands has seen the largest outbreak of the infection in the country outside of London.Across Europe, up to October last year there were 30,000 confirmed cases whereas the previous year there were just 941. Around 80% of cases have been seen in Birmingham, with about 10% in Coventry, with other local authority areas seeing a rise in cases.One school, the Frederick Bird Academy, in Coventry, has been holding measles vaccination clinics after two pupils were taken to hospital with the disease.Parts of Birmingham and the Black Country have among the lowest vaccination rates in the UK.Dr Naveed Syed a consultant in health protection for UKHSA believes “fake news” and fears surrounding vaccination prompted by the coronavirus are behind the reluctance to have the two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab. The main symptoms of measles include a high fever, sore and red watery eyes, coughing, sneezing and a rash that usually appears after initial symptoms.“In a typical winter we would see no cases of measles at all,” Dr Neil Bugg, deputy medical director at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said.He added: “It’s because it’s so contagious, if you put a child with measles in a room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine of them would catch it.”Among children under the age of five, the infection appears to be spreading the fastest, with 40% of those who test positive requiring hospital care. Dr Naveed Syad said that with the rise in cases coming in the wake of the pandemic, which ""has stirred up a lot if issues"".“Some of it goes back to the now debunked claims between MMR and autism, which isn't there,"" he said.“Some of the communities are still holding onto that sort of fake news around that.  ""It's a challenge to try and overturn some of those myths, which have become more embedded in some communities.”Measles vaccinations were introduced in the UK in 1968 and are estimated to have prevented 20 million cases and 4,500 deaths.The MMR jab, itself introduced nearly 30 years ago, is part of the routine NHS schedule of childhood vaccines. It is given in two doses, the first before age two and the second before age five.

Jo Tucker, from Paulton, was diagnosed with alopecia in 2017 and now uses people's reaction to her condition to filter out potential partners. ""I've been on a date where a guy has said 'oh I'm not sure if I'd fancy you without hair', which stings,"" she said. Ms Tucker said her hair fell out in just two weeks during a time of stress. The mother-of-three, who is due to appear in the next series of Channel 4's First Dates, told BBC Radio Bristol: ""Some people are understanding. ""Some people can't consider the concept and they immediately think there's something wrong with you so you're immediately evicted from the dating scene. ""It's a mixed bag really."" Ms Tucker first noticed a bald patch ""the size of the top of a coke can"" on her head. ""I'd had my third daughter. I'd just gone back to work. I was exhausted. It was Christmas, so it was quite a stressful time,"" said the 43-year-old. ""I'd found a patch before when I was pregnant with my second daughter and everything grew back so I was a bit relaxed,"" added Ms Tucker, However, in the space of two weeks, her ""hair fell out completely"". ""In the shower, you'd run the shampoo through your hair and as you run your fingers through, a big rat's tail of hair would come out,"" she said. Ms Tucker said the experience was ""horrific"" and she would ""double take"" herself in mirrors. She said she ""didn't know what to do"" and ""didn't feel myself with no hair"". Ms Tucker started wearing a hat but moved on to using wigs which made her ""confident and comfortable"" in her own skin again. ""It's taken a long time to get there. The acceptance is the freedom,"" she added. Ms Tucker has about 40-50 wigs but said there was ""a stigma attached"" to wig wearing which ""is a real shame"". ""You think of fancy dress wigs and you think about the old-fashioned ones... they've come on such a long way, they're amazing. ""It can be a lifesaver for some people as in, it really saves your confidence and makes you feel so much better about yourself.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nyy18jwz2o,Shake up of senior management at hospital trust,,2024-01-12,"A major overhaul of senior management is coming to an NHS trust which runs two of north-east England's biggest hospitals, the BBC understands.Internal documents have revealed changes to the senior leadership at Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.The trust, which runs the Royal Victoria Infirmary and Freeman Hospital, is also drawing up plans to work closer with other trusts in the region, and has recently appointed a new chief executive.A Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection report, which the BBC understands is likely to be highly critical, is due in the coming weeks. The trust has declined to comment further. The changes being made to senior management do not relate to the impending CQC inspection report, according to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), external.The trust had been rated outstanding, but that was withdrawn after ""significant disparities"" between the 2019 ranking and recent inspection findings. Sir Jim Mackey has been chief executive since the start of 2024, and more senior staff changes are coming up. Signs of issues at the hospitals became apparent in 2023, when inspectors issued a warning notice saying immediate action was needed to improve the quality and safety of care given to patients with mental health needs, autism, or learning disabilities.The RVI's maternity services were also rated as needing improvement.There were also problems with the IT system, which failed to send out 24,000 medical letters to GPs. Under the new leadership, there are also moves to work more closely with other hospitals with the launch of the Great North Care Alliance in April.It will mean closer working between Newcastle, Northumbria, Gateshead, and North Cumbria.

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars.

Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years. Justice Cavanagh said in his sentencing remarks that Alfie had been the victim of a ""frenzied attack"" in which he suffered about 50 injuries on the night of his death. He said to Hedges: ""You were Alfie's mother and he deserved your protection."" Sam Phillips, Alfie's father, described him as ""good as gold"" and ""lively"", adding he had been ""robbed of the opportunity to see him grown up"". ""The funeral was one of the hardest days of my lives. The images of his tiny coffin will stay with me forever,"" he said. Hedges, of Yelverton, Devon, and Benham, killed Alfie overnight during lockdown in Benham's caravan in Hernhill, near Faversham. During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body. The court heard that on the night before Alfie died, Hedges went to buy drugs from their friend and repay her £400 debt, and also get mixers and drinks for their evening together in the caravan. Benham told police he bit Alfie on his back and shook him the morning he found him unresponsive in an attempt to rouse him, the jury heard. The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner. Asked if she had seen Mr Benham murder Alfie, she replied: ""No."" Mark Demain, Alfie's grandfather, said the toddler ""completed our lives"". ""We have never experience pain like this. I would describe it as if the light in our souls have gone out,"" he said. ""Our best friend, our grandson was so cruelly taken from us. Every day we are hurting."" Jurors previously heard about older injuries Alfie sustained in the months prior to his death and their explanations for them, such as a cut under his eye from playing with keys and his fingers being caught in the dog gate in Benham's parents' home. One incident was described in which Hedges described finding blood on the carpet, a cushion and a tissue, but was told Alfie had fallen and hit his mouth on the oil heater. Benham had described how he held Alfie above him but he slipped out of his hands and hit his nose on Benham's teeth, the court heard. Ms Hedges said she was not there and was unaware it had happened. When the pair were found guilty, Det Ch Insp Kathleen Way, of Kent Police, said the verdict would ""not bring Alfie back"", but would mean that ""Hedges and Benham lose their right to freedom and life as they know it"". ""Alfie should have been protected and loved by his mum, instead Hedges and Benham inflicted unimaginable suffering on him during a sustained and lengthy night of violence,"" she added. Following the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Way said Hedges and Benham inflicted ""unimaginable suffering"".

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered. Set in mature woodlands, an orchard and rolling fields, it sits behind electric gates and is framed by a stone-walled, Italianate garden. It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing."" Mr Maher also has two sons, aged 32 and 27, and a grandchild, aged two, from his first marriage. He has been working in the IT industry for the past 25 years and his wife Amanda, 54, is a school administrative assistant. He said he was ""overjoyed"" when he learned of his win. ""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires.""

Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years. Justice Cavanagh said in his sentencing remarks that Alfie had been the victim of a ""frenzied attack"" in which he suffered about 50 injuries on the night of his death. He said to Hedges: ""You were Alfie's mother and he deserved your protection."" Sam Phillips, Alfie's father, described him as ""good as gold"" and ""lively"", adding he had been ""robbed of the opportunity to see him grown up"". ""The funeral was one of the hardest days of my lives. The images of his tiny coffin will stay with me forever,"" he said. Hedges, of Yelverton, Devon, and Benham, killed Alfie overnight during lockdown in Benham's caravan in Hernhill, near Faversham. During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body. The court heard that on the night before Alfie died, Hedges went to buy drugs from their friend and repay her £400 debt, and also get mixers and drinks for their evening together in the caravan. Benham told police he bit Alfie on his back and shook him the morning he found him unresponsive in an attempt to rouse him, the jury heard. The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner. Asked if she had seen Mr Benham murder Alfie, she replied: ""No."" Mark Demain, Alfie's grandfather, said the toddler ""completed our lives"". ""We have never experience pain like this. I would describe it as if the light in our souls have gone out,"" he said. ""Our best friend, our grandson was so cruelly taken from us. Every day we are hurting."" Jurors previously heard about older injuries Alfie sustained in the months prior to his death and their explanations for them, such as a cut under his eye from playing with keys and his fingers being caught in the dog gate in Benham's parents' home. One incident was described in which Hedges described finding blood on the carpet, a cushion and a tissue, but was told Alfie had fallen and hit his mouth on the oil heater. Benham had described how he held Alfie above him but he slipped out of his hands and hit his nose on Benham's teeth, the court heard. Ms Hedges said she was not there and was unaware it had happened. When the pair were found guilty, Det Ch Insp Kathleen Way, of Kent Police, said the verdict would ""not bring Alfie back"", but would mean that ""Hedges and Benham lose their right to freedom and life as they know it"". ""Alfie should have been protected and loved by his mum, instead Hedges and Benham inflicted unimaginable suffering on him during a sustained and lengthy night of violence,"" she added. Following the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Way said Hedges and Benham inflicted ""unimaginable suffering"". She said: ""He should have been protected and loved by his mother, but instead lost his life in appalling circumstances."" Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered. Set in mature woodlands, an orchard and rolling fields, it sits behind electric gates and is framed by a stone-walled, Italianate garden. It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing."" Mr Maher also has two sons, aged 32 and 27, and a grandchild, aged two, from his first marriage. He has been working in the IT industry for the past 25 years and his wife Amanda, 54, is a school administrative assistant. He said he was ""overjoyed"" when he learned of his win. ""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires."" Omaze said the draw also raised £3.5m for the RSPCA, the UK's largest and oldest animal welfare charity. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Begum pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office and was jailed for 16 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. She had worked at the Category B prison in Winson Green since December 2018. When she claimed to be supervising the prisoner, they instead had sex when they could not be seen by other officers or inmates, the force said. Begum was arrested on 3 October 2022 and refused to answer any questions from detectives.

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded.

""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-67963420,Kent charity fined over escape of 'ladies' man' emu,"An animal charity has been given a £100 fine after a ""ladies' man"" emu escaped.",2024-01-12,"An animal charity has been given a £100 fine after a ""ladies' man"" emu escaped. Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood. Ms James added she had acquired Dugee from someone who bought an emu egg online and hatched it at their home. Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November. Police officers were alerted and helped locate the flightless bird in a residential street close to its home. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Mr Cribbens said: ""We have had a disappointingly high number of fan behaviour issues this season and these need to stop.""Too often we are faced with incidents which are damaging the reputation of the club and fans."" Currently, children under 14 years old are not allowed to enter Carlisle United's grounds, Brunton Park, without an adult. The club says it is now reconsidering the minimum age limit.Mr Cribbens said: ""As well as four bans arising from the incident at the Port Vale game, we had another juvenile caught attempting to bring a flare into the Charlton game.""Ticket checks, CCTV coverage, searches and stewarding will all be increased for the rest of the season, the club said. Mr Ripley was abused by fans at the Warwick Road End of the grounds during the New Year's Day game.The goalkeeper wrote on social media after the match: ""I don't mind people saying stuff to me normally and I will always give a bit back, because that's who I am, but in all my years playing football I've never had anyone tell me 'go and hang yourself'.""Carlisle United manager Paul Simpson said: ""There’s a level of banter to be had, I get that and it’s perfectly normal, but some of the things that were said to Connor Ripley went over the line of banter and just aren’t acceptable.""

PC Chris Duffy was apprehending Mason Perkins's brother in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March when he was hit by Perkins. The court heard that after the officer fell to the floor, Perkins then also ""pummelled"" his face and body. At Nottingham Crown Court, Perkins was handed an 11-and-a-half year sentence. Warning: A distressing image of PC Duffy's injuries is below PC Duffy, a police dog handler, sustained a ""blow to the head with a relatively heavy object with an edge like a machete, saw or axe"", the court heard on Friday. The officer's injury was described by a forensic pathologist as a ""chop wound"". PC Duffy - who now has a scar from one side of his head to the other - is back on duty. Following an argument at Sunnydale pub, in Mansfield Woodhouse, where Perkins was barred, PC Duffy apprehended Perkins' brother in an alleyway. The court heard Perkins, 25, entered the alleyway and politely asked the officer if he could pass. PC Duffy, believing Perkins was an innocent member of the public, moved to allow him to walk behind. The officer then felt his head being ""violently jolted"" and was thrown to the floor. Perkins next punched and kicked PC Duffy on both sides of the body and face. As the officer got to his feet, Perkins escaped. About 15 minutes later, when PC Duffy was walking back to his car, he spotted Perkins and other officers gave chase and he was arrested. Perkins, of Moor Street, Mansfield, was found with cannabis, scales, and a cannabis grinder on him. Judge Nirmal Shant KC described the officer's injuries as ""grave"". She said: ""You struck the officer when he was not facing you. ""You struck him in a way that jolted him violently on the floor. ""You hit him and punched him and kicked him and bent over him, pummelling him to the side of the face, to the body, then making good your escape."" The judge added the attack had a ""profound effect"" on PC Duffy, saying it had not only left him with physical injuries but psychological injuries too. Perkins had previously admitted grievous bodily harm, supplying cannabis, and offering to supply a Class A drug. Det Sgt Matthew Dumbrell described the attack as ""utterly shocking"" and said the officer was ""fortunate to avoid more serious injuries"". He said: ""I am pleased Perkins will now spend a very considerable length of time in jail, and hope this sentence serves as a warning to others about the consequences of attacking our officers. ""I would also like to place on record my admiration for the officer involved, who in the moments before, during, and after this attack demonstrated so many of the qualities we expect from front-line police officers.""

I am exhausted, completely exhausted.""She said she now wanted the authority to move them somewhere else as the treatments were not solving the problem.She said: ""They are inside plugs on the wall, they are under floorboards, they are inside the walls in the property and at this point I just want to move out.""

Bob Child, 79, who ran a post office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, said he personally repaid £600 when the books would not balance 20 years ago. He remembered getting calls from other sub-postmasters who were worried about the same financial issues. He said at the time he had not made the link to the introduction of Horizon. ""When we did the books with a pen and paper, you'd occasionally be a few pounds over or under, but nothing much,"" he said. ""In about 2002, a few years after Horizon was introduced, we had a shortfall of £600. I couldn't understand and repaid it with my own money."" Mr Child, who is now retired and living in Little Downham near Ely, added: ""At the end of the day, your contract said you had to make good. ""I would say there must be hundreds of people out there who never went to court because they used their own money to make it up."" He said friends who ran other post offices would call him to tell of similar problems. ""When Horizon came in, we used to cash up on a Wednesday,"" said Mr Child. ""Postmasters were ringing me up at eight o'clock on a Wednesday night, saying, 'Bob, I've got a problem. I can't balance my books. I'm £300 in arrears. What am I going to do?'"" More than 900 workers across the country were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches. Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Victims of the Post Office scandal have been promised swift exoneration and compensation by the government. Mr Child told the BBC: ""It was puzzling but at the time, no-one questioned the system. Funnily, it was always a shortfall. I've never heard of anyone being over."" He said he wondered what had happened to the money he repaid. ""My understanding is that it went into a suspended account,"" he said. ""Then after two or three years, it moved into Post Office accounts."" Mr Child said using the Horizon system was often problematic. ""From the time it came in, it was so slow,"" he said. ""It could take hours to cash up - much longer that when we did it on paper."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

John Heath's wife, Helen, ran a Post Office in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and was one of hundreds of people accused in the Post Office scandal. ""She [Helen] died not knowing whether it was a member of her family that was stealing from her [or] one of her friends who were our employees. ""She had no idea. She carried that to her grave and that is unforgivable."" More than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software, called Horizon, made it look like money was missing from their branches. ""The Post Office destroyed my family,"" said Mr Heath, who lives in Melksham. He explained the software installed in the branch ""would come out with random figures"" when his wife tried to balance the books each Wednesday. When they phoned the helpline they were always told 'you're the only people having this problem'. Mr Heath's daughter, Vikki, said: ""The big tragedy in our family situation is that my mum went to her grave thinking that people were stealing and that is awful. ""That is something that me and my family will have to live with."" Following a campaign by former postmaster Alan Bates - recently dramatised for ITV - Mr Heath realised they were not alone. He said that following his wife's death he was appointed to run the branch without any training. He and his son, who also worked there, had ""exactly the same problems"" as his wife. Ms Heath explained that her father had ""suffered hugely"". ""He has had two strokes since the whole thing started. His mental and physical health has deteriorated hugely,"" she said. Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"".

The diesel buses were retrofitted with devices designed to reduce harmful emissions under a government project. Paul Blomfield, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, said the technology needed a consistent speed to work properly and travelling down hills hindered that. A Department for Transport minister said it was looking at mitigations. Funding was given to retrofit the buses, which are on average 12 years old, following the introduction of the Sheffield clean air zone in February. Mr Blomfield said about 75% of the 400 buses in the city were retrofitted, but most did not comply with Euro 6 emission standards. The MP said the government needed ""to move away from trying to refit the old buses"" and create a new fleet in order to hit clean air targets. ""We've all learnt that the government strategy of retrofitting hasn't worked and now they've got to come to terms with the consequences and provide us with the clean vehicles that we need,"" he said. Mr Blomfield said the main problem with the retrofit devices running in urban areas was that ""they do not reach the required temperatures to treat emissions as a result of the regular stop-start conditions"". He continued: ""It's a bigger problem in Sheffield because when they're coming downhill it doesn't reach the temperature."" James Vincent, BBC Yorkshire political editor Sheffield's hills are great, but they're not for everyone - and you can now add some buses into that category. The government's plan to retrofit old buses to make them environmentally friendly hasn't gone to plan. The lack of engine power needed for going down Sheffield's hills has been blamed by some. MPs in the city are asking for more zero-emission buses, with the first batch expected to start running in the spring. Air pollution contributes to one in 20 deaths in Sheffield each year, according to the city council. That is one of the reasons the city now has a clean air zone that charges polluting vehicles for driving in it. But many vehicles in the city's bus fleet have an exemption from payments. Speaking during a parliamentary debate in December, Conservative MP Anthony Browne said the retrofit scheme ""hadn't performed as expected in real world conditions"". The South Cambridgeshire MP, who is minister for aviation, decarbonisation of transport and future of transport, added: ""We are examining exactly what the impact is and what the mitigations can be."" Transport operator Stagecoach recently said it had debuted 20 new double-decker buses in Sheffield that did conform to emission standards and had bid for 65 new electric buses from the government. Matthew Topham, from campaign group Better Buses for South Yorkshire, said passengers wanted clean and reliable services. ""If your bus breaks down because it's too old, that means that service isn't turning up and you're left waiting at a cold, dark bus stop,"" he said. ""That's why we need these fleets to be invested in and brought up to the 21st Century standards."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Richard Bowser is accused of trying to kill Lee Jackson at the Tan Hill Inn, near Reeth, North Yorkshire on 21 July. He said his actions had been ""very stupid"" but claimed he had only wanted to ""scare"" Mr Jackson, adding: ""I didn't even think he was there."" Mr Bowser, 46, of Bishop Auckland, denies two counts of attempted murder. Teesside Crown Court has previously heard Mr Bowser confronted Mr Jackson when he came looking for him following a fight at the pub during which Mr Jackson's brother-in-law had been injured. Mr Bowser is said to have put a gun to Mr Jackson's head and pulled the trigger, but the chamber was empty. When Mr Jackson ran off and hid in a nearby bunk room the defendant is said to have loaded the weapon and fired four shots at the door of the room, with one bullet hitting Mr Jackson in the arm. Referring to the first incident Mr Bowser told the court said ""I was trying to frighten him. ""[Then] he burst out laughing. I didn't expect that. I was that shocked I thought: 'I'll show you it's real'."" Mr Bowser said he had then fired it at the door, but told jurors: ""I didn't even think he was there, I thought he had gone."" Describing his actions as ""very stupid [and] very dangerous"", he added: ""It was purely to scare him because he came looking for us."" The court has previously heard Mr Bowser had a revolver and a shot gun with him at the pub, where he was staying in a glamping pod. He said he had taken the weapons with him as the result of a five-year-long feud with another man, which had escalated to the point where he feared for his safety and that of his family. ""It was a means to scare them away,"" he said. Asked about the earlier fight, in which Mr Jackson's relative and two other people were injured, Mr Bowser said his behaviour was ""disgusting"" and he was ""ashamed"". Mr Bowser has admitted admitted assaulting three people but denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life as well as two counts of attempted murder. The trial continues.

Mr Scholey said ""a number of areas"" in Berkshire were susceptible to groundwater flooding - but they were ""particularly concerned"" about Great Shefford, which sits on the River Lambourn.""The risk from groundwater flooding may be a bit of a slow burner but it’s certainly a real risk, so people need to be alert to that,"" he said.He also said flooding from rivers - which is distinct from groundwater flooding - was a risk, especially in the event of more rain.""We are conscious that should we get a period of wet weather again in another week or two, this is a very saturated catchment now and [water levels] would respond quite quickly,"" he said.He said the EA had a pump ""ready to be operated"" in Great Shefford to move water ""in a less damaging direction"" if a trigger-point was reached in the groundwater level. Berkshire was one of many areas of England badly affected by flooding following heavy rain last week.In Cookham, residents said sewage was spilling into their homes as a result of the floods.Thames Water said the problem was due to flood defences near the sewage pumping station being ""overwhelmed"".West Berkshire Council said some of the flooding had been in unexpected areas and it was investigating as a result.At the weekend, prime minister Rishi Sunak visited flood-hit communities in Oxfordshire and said the government had invested £5.2bn in flood defences.However, a report by the National Audit Office in November said the number of extra homes to be protected from flooding in England had been almost halved, due to inflation having an impact on the amount of money invested.

Bernard Jenkin, MP for Harwich and North Essex, said the finale review was ""long overdue"". ""I first called for this nearly 20 years ago, and we need the extra capacity.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-67958855,Kingswood by-election: Voters will choose new MP after Chris Skidmore's resignation,"Following the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, voters in Kingswood will elect a new representative in February.",2024-01-12,"Following the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, voters in Kingswood will elect a new representative in February. The former minister stood down from his position earlier this month over the government's energy plans. Mr Skidmore said he could not continue as a Tory MP ahead of a vote on a bill to guarantee annual oil and gas licensing rounds - triggering a by-election to be held in February. So why is this happening and what does it mean? Born and raised in the constituency, Mr Skidmore was first elected as Kingswood MP in 2010. He studied history at Oxford University, writing several books on the subject, and was among a number of backbench MPs, including Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, who wrote chapters in Britannia Unchained in 2012, a book promoting a low tax, free market ideology. Mr Skidmore served in governments under Theresa May and Boris Johnson, and signed the UK's net zero pledge into law as Interim Minister for Energy. He resigned over government policy to allow further licenses to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea and has continued to advocate for net zero since quitting. Mr Skidmore said he had found himself increasingly at odds with government policy on the environment over the past 18 months and has said he has ""no regrets"" about leaving Parliament. Kingswood is in South Gloucestershire. People living there might tell you they are from Bristol, as it lies on the edge of the city conurbation, but South Gloucestershire is its own unitary authority area and Kingswood is home to one of the offices for South Gloucestershire Council, though its headquarters are in Yate. The constituency also includes the districts of Hanham, Warmley, Longwell Green and Emersons Green. Following a boundary review, the constituency is due to be abolished at the next general election. Mr Skidmore's seat had a Conservative majority of 11,220 in the 2019 general election and had previously been held by Labour from 1992 to 2010. Like many parts of the UK, voters here have suffered with a cost of living crisis, and the sluggish economic performance of the country post-Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic. Kingswood High Street is part of a £25m regeneration scheme, but that has not stopped many businesses from closing. With many people living here also commuting into Bristol, public transport, or a lack of it, is also a big issue. ""We've had bank closures, other shops close, and we need the impetus of an MP that cares about the community,"" one voter told the BBC this week. The constituency has only ever been served by Conservative or Labour MPs, with the latter already throwing their campaign might at the seat. This week, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves paid a visit, following a speech in the constituency at the start of the year from party leader Sir Keir Starmer. Only Labour have announced a candidate so far - former mayor of Lewisham Damien Egan. Mr Egan grew up in the Kingswood constituency and pipped Bristol mayor Marvin Rees for the Labour candidacy for the newly created seat of Bristol North East - which will include areas of Kingswood. While the Conservatives are yet to announce their candidate, neighbouring Thornbury and Yate Tory MP Luke Hall criticised Labour's choice. He said: ""Do they really want the sitting mayor of Lewisham to be their member of parliament for Kingswood? ""Or do they want a local champion, who's lived in South Gloucestershire all their life?"" Mr Egan officially resigned as mayor of Lewisham earlier this week. One party which won't be standing is Reform UK, in protest over the cost. Their party leader Richard Tice described the by-election as ""a scandal of selfishness, of hypocrisy, and of grotesque abuse of taxpayers' cash"". The Kingswood by-election is being held on 15 February. It is one of two by-elections taking place on the same day as voters in Wellingborough will also go to the polls to replace Conservative Peter Bone, who lost the seat following a sexual misconduct scandal.

Jason Hoodlass, 27, befriended the victims on 16 July and gave them money to play in the arcades before assaulting them at Ross Castle. He then took the children to Grimsby and bought them new clothing before leaving them to return home alone. Hoodlass pleaded guilty to offences including abduction, sexual assault, voyeurism and taking indecent images. He was remanded in custody at Grimsby Crown Court and will appear for sentencing on 22 March. Hoodlass, of Kings Road, Immingham, also admitted two counts of breaching a sexual harm prevention order. PC Eleanor Burgess, of Humberside Police, said: ""This was a shocking case in which a perverted criminal targeted two vulnerable young children and sexually assaulted them for his own depraved gratification. ""I want to commend the children and their family for the courage and bravery that they have shown throughout the investigative and court process."" She added: ""By reporting this incident to us they have helped put a dangerous offender before the courts, ultimately resulting in him being remanded in custody and unable to target any other children.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-67950809,Nunny's Farm: Animals die from yew tree poisoning at Grimsby petting farm,"Several animals have died at a north east Lincolnshire petting farm after being accidentally fed yew tree branches, the owner has said.",2024-01-12,"Several animals have died at a north east Lincolnshire petting farm after being accidentally fed yew tree branches, the owner has said. Neil Campbell, of Nunny's Farm in Grimsby, said the toxic tree had been mixed in with donated Christmas trees. As a result, three Southdown sheep and three goats died on Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Campbell said: ""It's very upsetting for us. We were very attached to the animals and so were the public."" He said all the dead animals showed had the hallmarks of poisoning, with yew trees later found among Christmas trees. Christmas spruces and firs are regularly fed to the animals because they are a good, natural dewormer, explained Mr Campbell. However, he suggested ""only a trained eye"" was likely to be able to distinguish a highly toxic yew from a Christmas tree. Mr Campbell said the farm was treating it as a mistake. The deceased sheep were named Meeni, Mynie and Mo. The goats were named Megan, Ian and Holly. ""A lot of people will have met the goats, in particular, during visits to schools and care homes, as well at the farm,"" said Mr Campbell, who added the surviving animals were feeling ""a bit lost and depressed"". According to The Woodland Trust, yew trees contain ""highly poisonous"" taxane alkaloids. Nick Edwards, a toxicologist with the Veterinary Poisons Information Service, said: ""There are not that many very toxic plants in the UK, but the yew tree is one of them. ""All parts of the tree are poisonous. Grazing animals, such as sheep and goats, that consume significant qualities could come to harm, including dying."" Following the first deaths, the farm was immediately swept for any remaining yew tree branches, said Mr Campbell. Nunny's Farm was officially opened in April 2021 and attracts up to 30,000 visitors a year. The farm was badly flooded in storms in October and again in December, thwarting plans to open over winter.

Devon and Cornwall Police said the plaques were reported stolen from Ilfracombe War Memorial in Church Street on Thursday. They were later found in Bideford and recovered by police. Officers said two men, aged 39 and 43, were charged with handling stolen goods and dealing in tainted cultural objects. They are due to appear at Exeter Magistrates' Court on Saturday, police said. Initially, police arrested three men in connection to the theft. One Bideford man, aged 51, remains on police bail until 18 January. The force said the plaques detailed the names of fallen military personnel from World War One and Two and had commemorative inscriptions honouring their sacrifices. Police believe they were stolen between 14:30 GMT on Wednesday and 11:30 GMT on Thursday. They were found in Bideford following a call from a member of the public. Supt Toby Davies said of the thefts on X, ""words fail"" and said the plaques would be returned to the war memorial. The force appealed for anyone with information to contact them.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-67955787,Reed Wischhusen jailed for planning 'revenge' mass shooting,A man who planned a 'revenge' mass shooting at his former school has been sentenced to life in prison.,2024-01-12,"A man who planned a 'revenge' mass shooting at his former school has been sentenced to life in prison. Reed Wischhusen, 32, from Wick St Lawrence, Somerset, was also convicted of weapons charges after he made his own armoury of explosives, firearms and ammunition. He wrote a 1,700-word document which listed who he planned to kill. It included teachers at his former school and officers at the headquarters of Avon and Somerset Police. After being arrested, Wischhusen told detectives his document was a fantasy he never intended to act out. But during sentencing at Bristol Crown Court, Judge Martin Picton said: ""I have no doubt that what you committed to writing about represented your true thoughts and intents rather than fantasy."" Over a 10-day trial which ended in October, the court was told how the Lidl warehouse worker had a fascination with mass killings like the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, Dunblane massacre in 1996 and the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. To carry out his plans, Wischhusen compiled an armoury of homemade weapons including pistols, submachine guns and a shotgun, as well as ammunition, bombs, grenades and poison. He planned to attack his former school, Priory School in Worle, targeting people he believed had wronged him, as well as killing teachers. The plan would culminate in an attack on Avon and Somerset Police's headquarters, where he would either plant and detonate pressure cooker bombs, before opening fire on staff with submachine guns or ambush officers and enter the building to let off explosives. Police went to the house Wischhusen shared with his father in Wick Road, Wick St Lawrence in November 2022, having received a tip-off. Officers found several weapons, as well as body armour, a police uniform and a deactivated hand grenade, when they searched the property. More than 600 blank cartridges, nearly 1,500 primers - the component of a gun which propels the ammunition - and more than 1,000 unfired bullets for a range of different firearms were also seized, along with a large quantity of assorted chemicals, timers, metal tubes, pressure cookers and ball bearings. During the search Wischhusen attempted to take his own life in the bathroom with a pistol he had hidden in his coat. He then ran at armed officers pointing the gun at them. Two armed officers warned him to put it down, but as he continued to come towards them, he was shot three times. He needed lengthy hospital treatment and it was several months before he could be questioned. His trial was told that he entitled his document ""revenge"" and said in the introduction: ""Yes, revenge is on my mind. It's a powerful motivator, be nice to get back at the people who caused me stress and worry over the years. It's been eating away at my brain like cancer."" Jurors found him guilty of having an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, having an explosive substance, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm without a certificate. He had already admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a prohibited firearm and possessing ammunition without a firearm certificate. Passing sentence, Judge Picton said Wischhusen was ""obsessed with firearms and explosives"" and only a life sentence was appropriate. ""I have watched and rewatched the video footage and you were calm and controlled,"" he said. ""Having chosen to carry a loaded firearm on your person when going about your daily life, shows the danger you pose to society. ""The fact that you were prepared to use a loaded firearm in the presence of these officers and in the context of your thoughts in the journals is deeply concerning. ""The bodyworn camera footage is deeply shocking."" Wischhusen will have to serve a minimum of 12 years before he is considered for parole. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

She took him into private areas of the prison and claimed she was supervising him, West Midlands Police said. But staff became suspicious and she was caught in the act after an investigation. Begum pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office and was jailed for 16 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. She had worked at the Category B prison in Winson Green since December 2018. When she claimed to be supervising the prisoner, they instead had sex when they could not be seen by other officers or inmates, the force said. Begum was arrested on 3 October 2022 and refused to answer any questions from detectives.

Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years.

Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body.

Daisy Bull died in December after being diagnosed with cancer in her kidney three years ago. Hundreds of people stood by the side of roads in Retford in Nottinghamshire to pay their respects to Daisy. Part of the seven-mile route went past Daisy's school, where the children applauded as Daisy's coffin and the convoy went past. Daisy's mum, Sally Bull, said her daughter ""was something else"". ""She was a little bit different from your average 12-year-old,"" Mrs Bull said. ""She loved lorries and went everywhere with her dad in his lorry."" Daisy came from a family of lorry drivers, and her mum thinks she would have grown up to be a professional lorry driver too. Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December. Nick Bull, Daisy's father, said she ""fought so hard and won the first two battles but wasn't strong enough to win the war"". Daisy's coffin was on the back of a green and white Scania 730, driven by her dad, who runs a haulage company. Daisy's uncle drove the lorry behind, and her cousin drove another lorry. Mrs Bull said the funeral convoy was ""very different but very nice"". ""We are a massive lorry family with crazy lorry friends,"" she said.

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Shania Begum, 25, from Leegomery, Telford, carried out the inappropriate relationship with the male prisoner at HMP Birmingham. She took him into private areas of the prison and claimed she was supervising him, West Midlands Police said. But staff became suspicious and she was caught in the act after an investigation. Begum pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office and was jailed for 16 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. She had worked at the Category B prison in Winson Green since December 2018. When she claimed to be supervising the prisoner, they instead had sex when they could not be seen by other officers or inmates, the force said. Begum was arrested on 3 October 2022 and refused to answer any questions from detectives. ""The behaviour of Begum clearly erodes the public's trust in her as a prison officer, and she now faces a period of time behind bars,"" Det Con Adam McHugh said.

However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing."" Mr Maher also has two sons, aged 32 and 27, and a grandchild, aged two, from his first marriage. He has been working in the IT industry for the past 25 years and his wife Amanda, 54, is a school administrative assistant. He said he was ""overjoyed"" when he learned of his win. ""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires."" Omaze said the draw also raised £3.5m for the RSPCA, the UK's largest and oldest animal welfare charity. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-67958022,Former Lancashire policeman jailed over 'jealous rage' attack,"A police officer who brutally attacked his ex-girlfriend in a ""jealous rage"" has been jailed.",2024-01-12,"A police officer who brutally attacked his ex-girlfriend in a ""jealous rage"" has been jailed. James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood. Ms James added she had acquired Dugee from someone who bought an emu egg online and hatched it at their home. Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November. Police officers were alerted and helped locate the flightless bird in a residential street close to its home. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Begum pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office and was jailed for 16 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. She had worked at the Category B prison in Winson Green since December 2018. When she claimed to be supervising the prisoner, they instead had sex when they could not be seen by other officers or inmates, the force said. Begum was arrested on 3 October 2022 and refused to answer any questions from detectives.

PC Chris Duffy was apprehending Mason Perkins's brother in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March when he was hit by Perkins. The court heard that after the officer fell to the floor, Perkins then also ""pummelled"" his face and body. At Nottingham Crown Court, Perkins was handed an 11-and-a-half year sentence. Warning: A distressing image of PC Duffy's injuries is below PC Duffy, a police dog handler, sustained a ""blow to the head with a relatively heavy object with an edge like a machete, saw or axe"", the court heard on Friday. The officer's injury was described by a forensic pathologist as a ""chop wound"". PC Duffy - who now has a scar from one side of his head to the other - is back on duty. Following an argument at Sunnydale pub, in Mansfield Woodhouse, where Perkins was barred, PC Duffy apprehended Perkins' brother in an alleyway. The court heard Perkins, 25, entered the alleyway and politely asked the officer if he could pass. PC Duffy, believing Perkins was an innocent member of the public, moved to allow him to walk behind. The officer then felt his head being ""violently jolted"" and was thrown to the floor. Perkins next punched and kicked PC Duffy on both sides of the body and face. As the officer got to his feet, Perkins escaped. About 15 minutes later, when PC Duffy was walking back to his car, he spotted Perkins and other officers gave chase and he was arrested. Perkins, of Moor Street, Mansfield, was found with cannabis, scales, and a cannabis grinder on him. Judge Nirmal Shant KC described the officer's injuries as ""grave"". She said: ""You struck the officer when he was not facing you. ""You struck him in a way that jolted him violently on the floor. ""You hit him and punched him and kicked him and bent over him, pummelling him to the side of the face, to the body, then making good your escape."" The judge added the attack had a ""profound effect"" on PC Duffy, saying it had not only left him with physical injuries but psychological injuries too. Perkins had previously admitted grievous bodily harm, supplying cannabis, and offering to supply a Class A drug. Det Sgt Matthew Dumbrell described the attack as ""utterly shocking"" and said the officer was ""fortunate to avoid more serious injuries"". He said: ""I am pleased Perkins will now spend a very considerable length of time in jail, and hope this sentence serves as a warning to others about the consequences of attacking our officers. ""I would also like to place on record my admiration for the officer involved, who in the moments before, during, and after this attack demonstrated so many of the qualities we expect from front-line police officers.""

John Heath's wife, Helen, ran a Post Office in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and was one of hundreds of people accused in the Post Office scandal. ""She [Helen] died not knowing whether it was a member of her family that was stealing from her [or] one of her friends who were our employees. ""She had no idea. She carried that to her grave and that is unforgivable."" More than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software, called Horizon, made it look like money was missing from their branches. ""The Post Office destroyed my family,"" said Mr Heath, who lives in Melksham. He explained the software installed in the branch ""would come out with random figures"" when his wife tried to balance the books each Wednesday. When they phoned the helpline they were always told 'you're the only people having this problem'. Mr Heath's daughter, Vikki, said: ""The big tragedy in our family situation is that my mum went to her grave thinking that people were stealing and that is awful. ""That is something that me and my family will have to live with."" Following a campaign by former postmaster Alan Bates - recently dramatised for ITV - Mr Heath realised they were not alone. He said that following his wife's death he was appointed to run the branch without any training. He and his son, who also worked there, had ""exactly the same problems"" as his wife. Ms Heath explained that her father had ""suffered hugely"". ""He has had two strokes since the whole thing started. His mental and physical health has deteriorated hugely,"" she said. Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"".

Bob Child, 79, who ran a post office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, said he personally repaid £600 when the books would not balance 20 years ago. He remembered getting calls from other sub-postmasters who were worried about the same financial issues. He said at the time he had not made the link to the introduction of Horizon. ""When we did the books with a pen and paper, you'd occasionally be a few pounds over or under, but nothing much,"" he said. ""In about 2002, a few years after Horizon was introduced, we had a shortfall of £600. I couldn't understand and repaid it with my own money."" Mr Child, who is now retired and living in Little Downham near Ely, added: ""At the end of the day, your contract said you had to make good. ""I would say there must be hundreds of people out there who never went to court because they used their own money to make it up."" He said friends who ran other post offices would call him to tell of similar problems. ""When Horizon came in, we used to cash up on a Wednesday,"" said Mr Child. ""Postmasters were ringing me up at eight o'clock on a Wednesday night, saying, 'Bob, I've got a problem. I can't balance my books. I'm £300 in arrears. What am I going to do?'"" More than 900 workers across the country were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches. Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Victims of the Post Office scandal have been promised swift exoneration and compensation by the government. Mr Child told the BBC: ""It was puzzling but at the time, no-one questioned the system. Funnily, it was always a shortfall. I've never heard of anyone being over."" He said he wondered what had happened to the money he repaid. ""My understanding is that it went into a suspended account,"" he said. ""Then after two or three years, it moved into Post Office accounts."" Mr Child said using the Horizon system was often problematic. ""From the time it came in, it was so slow,"" he said.

A report has recommended the venue in Whitchurch, Shropshire, be knocked down following the discovery of Raac, the building material at risk of crumbling. Most of the centre was shut in September, with the report suggesting that clearing the site and developing it would be the most cost-effective solution to the issue. But protestors said they wanted it repaired or rebuilt instead. The report, due to go before Shropshire Council's cabinet on Wednesday, sets out six options including repair at a quoted cost of £2.5m - a sum the document describes as ""significant"". The other options include doing nothing, replacing the building with a new civic centre at a cost of up to £7.6m, and clearing the site and making it available for a ""mixed use development"" at a cost of £1.25m. The report recommends councillors support the latter. Most of the people demonstrating outside the civic centre on Friday said it was a key community asset. Jason Wainwright, a member of the town's Operatic Society and Little Theatre group, said it was a unique venue in north Shropshire and that up to 50 groups used it regularly. ""There isn't anywhere else in the town for all those groups to go,"" he said, adding that without a civic centre, many of them would fold. Melissa Nicholson has used the building as a base for her dog training business and said: ""They've been fantastic at accommodating me."" She said being without a civic centre was ""unimaginable"". Retired resident Chrissy Bebbington added: ""I come to all the shows - there's just such a wide community of people that use the civic centre. ""It's the centre of the town, it's the hub."" Local politicians have also said they will fight to get the building repaired or replaced. North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat, said: ""I think there's a lack of imagination on what can replace it."" She said the likely cost of rebuilding the centre was ""not a huge amount of money compared to some of the investments the council's made in Shrewsbury in the past"". Town mayor, Andy Hall, who is also chair of the town council, has called a public meeting on Saturday, describing the venua as ""the heartbeat of Whitchurch"" and urged Shropshire Council not to ""make any rash decisions"". Shropshire Council member Tom Biggins, one of the councillors who represents the town, said there had been a town hall on the civic centre site for centuries and he opposed any suggestion of homes being built there. He said the likely costs of replacing the building were far smaller than the £13m currently being spent on a new swimming pool in Whitchurch. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Faith Atkins, originally from Sutton Coldfield, who runs a Barmouth hotel, hoped Birmingham people were ""not put off by one person's opinion"". Dyfed-Powys Police said the note was added to a property in Iorwerth Avenue, Aberystwyth, on Monday night. It urged people to take their ""vomit-inducing accents back to Brummyland and please take a few thousand"" others with them. Ms Atkins, from Min-y-Mor hotel in Barmouth, said it welcomed guests from all over the UK. The hotelier thought Brummies had traditionally come to one of the closest seaside towns to Birmingham and ""that will continue"". Asked if those going there were loud and brash, she replied: ""I don't think so. I mean obviously the Brummie accent's very recognisable. ""We get lots of people from Liverpool as well as other areas, Stoke, so they're all sort of recognisable accents... but it's not necessarily a bad thing."" A director and owner of Vale Holiday Parks' Clarach Bay site close to Aberystwyth, Thomas Scarrott, said he was ""very, very disgusted"" by the letter's content. He added: ""We've got 6,000 students from across the globe in the university. We welcome families from as far as Syria and the Ukraine and people from the Midlands. ""We've always welcomed them with open arms and long may it continue.""

An inspection of Shropshire Council's services looked at arrangements for children subject to a protection plan. Weaknesses included the quality of management oversight and staff supervision, said Ofsted. The council said it was ""absolutely committed"" to ensuring best outcomes for children in the county. Since an inspection in February 2022 there had been a deterioration in the quality of social work practice for the affected children, inspectors found. ""There are serious and widespread systemic failings, leading to weaknesses in child protection practice, which leave children at risk of inadequate protection and significant harm,"" the report said. Inspectors carried out the latest visit in November 2023 and found too many social workers and managers were failing to ensure protection processes were being followed to manage escalating risks to children. Vulnerable children were also being exposed to risk of harm for extended periods, the report said. Since the inspection there had been ""considerable challenges"" in the recruitment and retention of staff, it added, which had led to an ""over-reliance on agency workers in the case management teams"". This had resulted in a ""level of inexperience,"" inspectors said. The report added that senior leadership team at the council had acknowledged the shortfalls identified by inspectors and expressed a commitment to improve,  but inspectors criticised the pace of that improvement as being ""too slow"". Shropshire Council will now be required to submit an action plan detailing how it will improve within 70 days. Councillor Kirstie Hurst-Knight, in charge of children and education, said the authority had identified many of the issues raised and was working hard to address them. The council was in the process of recruiting 20 new social care roles to help ease caseload pressure, she said. ""Yes, this report raises some difficult issues, however we have a highly-skilled and passionate workforce who make a real difference to the lives of children and families in Shropshire,"" she added.

Basil Brockhurst, of Market Drayton, complained to Shropshire Council over the ban because he also wanted to show he is a ""proud Shropshire man"". Mr Brockhurst, an army veteran, now wants to go further to display his regimental crest and the Poppy Appeal logo on his taxi. He can now put a flag on his bonnet but also wants to display bigger ones. The council's revised regulations now permit one union jack, no bigger than A4 in size, on a vehicle's bonnet. Despite the victory, Mr Brockhurst, said he ""could not understand"" the restrictions on the flag used. He has been supported in his fight by his MP, Helen Morgan, and his councillor, Ian Nellins. Mr Nellins said he knew Mr Brockhurst ""very well"" and used his taxi on a number of occasions. ""I was never aware of anybody who was offended by any of his flags, so when it was raised I did bring the amendment to the council to ask for something to be done,"" he said. Mr Nellins said the ruling had ""struck somewhere halfway"", but he said Mr Brockhurst had to accept ""we are a rules-based society, we have to have some form of control"".

He has been told he will need the permission of the Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion to display the regimental crest and the poppy symbol on his vehicle. If permission is granted, he will then have to apply to the council to be allowed to use them, the authority said. Mr Nellins said: ""He had them on his taxi before, I didn't serve in the same regiment, but I wasn't offended to use his taxi because of that and I don't think anybody else in the Market Drayton area was either.""

Dr Marta Krawiec, 41, was in central London cycling to work when she was hit by Kevin Allen's HGV, in August 2021. She suffered multiple injuries in the collision, which happened when he turned left from the middle lane, the Old Bailey heard. Allen, who denied death by dangerous driving, will be sentenced at a later date. Jurors were told Dr Krawiec's death was the result of a ""driver error"" on 69-year-old Allen's part, due to his failure to indicate until just before he turned. Judge Richard Marks said it was a ""tragic and difficult case"". Allen, of Forest Town, Nottinghamshire, had been delivering steel to a building site in the capital on the ""bright, clear summer morning"", prosecutor previously Paul Casey told the court. The HGV was stationary in the middle of three lanes at a red light, at the junction of Southampton Row and Theobalds Road. Dr Krawiec, who was wearing brightly coloured clothes and a helmet, was behind the vehicle to the left. Allen had not been indicating and was in the lane to move forward, rather than left, jurors heard. By the time the the light had turned green, Dr Krawiec was level with the lorry. At this point Allen indicated and turned left, clipping the rear wheel of her bicycle and dragging her under his vehicle. In a statement released after her death, on 4 August 2021, Dr Krawiec's parents said: ""Marta lived helping other people every day. She died on the way to her patients. ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved daughter and sister."" In a police interview Allen said he had checked his mirrors but had not seen Dr Krawiec. He admitted causing her death by careless driving but denied it was dangerous. Allen was granted continued bail until his sentencing on a date yet to be fixed.

Presiding over the sentencing, Judge David Evans said he was in no doubt that in March 2021, Mohammed had gone to the University in Exeter hoping to find a party where he would meet a woman. The jury had heard how he had made sexualised comments during a night of socialising in the accommodation block. The victim went to bed at about midnight and left her door open so her friends could check on her as she was feeling unwell, the court was told. Later that night, Mohammed entered the victim's bedroom and began raping her while she was asleep. She woke up, pushed him off and ran to a friend's room, the court was told. The student was so traumatised by what happened she moved out of her room. Police said DNA linked to Mohammed, who denied the offence, was found on the victim's clothes. Det Con Alex Powe, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: ""Mohammed took advantage of the victim while she was asleep. ""I am pleased that he will now serve a considerable amount of time in prison where he can no longer be a threat to women.""I am incredibly grateful to the victim and her friends for the courage they have shown and their tenacity to bring this offender to justice.""

It said they were bought by an ""online international bidder"". No other details were given of the buyer, but the auction house said competition had been fierce - with 219 pre-sale bids placed from all over the world. The hammer price was £22,000 - with fees taking the total paid by the buyer to £28,864. Amanda Butler, head of operations at the auctioneer, said ""the global interest was phenomenal"". ""I just can't believe the result and the impact this find has had,"" she said. ""Bidders went crazy for these scripts."" The scripts were used for the two-part season finale, titled The One With Ross's Wedding.

Bus lanes are now set to be created on two stretches of London Road, two stretches of Oxford Road, and stretches on Bath Road and Southampton Street.Mr Ennis said it was ""an excellent project"", with independent councillor Sarah Hacker saying she had to clean her windows that are ""thick with grime"" as a result of air pollution in the city. The most controversial change is turning one of two inbound traffic lanes in London Road, between Liverpool Road and Cemetery Junction, into a bus lane.Green councillor Rob White claimed the change would increase the morning traffic queue by 176 cars and the evening queue by 107 cars.He said the Greens supported ""five out of the six bus lanes"" but asked for a decision on London Road to be deferred.But the plans for all six lanes were approved on Thursday. The project has gone ahead after the council received £26.3m from the government to improve the bus network in 2022.Reading Borough Council said the bus lanes would be constructed between February 2024 and March 2025.

Trowbridge Town Hall's refurbishment is part of a £16m investment in the town from the government's Future High Streets Fund. The main contractor, Beard, said it is on track to complete work on the building in the summer of 2025. When work is completed the property will become a creative and cultural hub and live music venue for the town. The existing battens and roof tiles have been taken off and there has been temporary weather proofing put on. The removal of a suspended ceiling has revealed the original roof trusses and a vaulted ceiling. The team working on the building has also been demolishing old offices and internal walls so the hall can be fully opened up. Specialist stonemasons have begun the restoration to preserve the external stonework. Beard said that work has been progressing very well, with Councillor Phil Alford, Wiltshire Council's Cabinet Member for Strategic Assets adding the authority is ""very pleased with the progress being made"" and the care being taken to protect the hall's historic features. ""It's great to see the Town Hall shaping up to be once again the landmark cultural venue in the centre of Trowbridge,"" Mr Alford added. Trowbridge Town Hall Trust, which uses the building, will be given a 125-year lease once the work has finished. As a result of lots of work in the town centre, there have been road closures and changes to bus stops, including roadworks at Manver Street.

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years. Justice Cavanagh said in his sentencing remarks that Alfie had been the victim of a ""frenzied attack"" in which he suffered about 50 injuries on the night of his death. He said to Hedges: ""You were Alfie's mother and he deserved your protection."" Sam Phillips, Alfie's father, described him as ""good as gold"" and ""lively"", adding he had been ""robbed of the opportunity to see him grown up"". ""The funeral was one of the hardest days of my lives. The images of his tiny coffin will stay with me forever,"" he said. Hedges, of Yelverton, Devon, and Benham, killed Alfie overnight during lockdown in Benham's caravan in Hernhill, near Faversham. During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body. The court heard that on the night before Alfie died, Hedges went to buy drugs from their friend and repay her £400 debt, and also get mixers and drinks for their evening together in the caravan. Benham told police he bit Alfie on his back and shook him the morning he found him unresponsive in an attempt to rouse him, the jury heard. The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner. Asked if she had seen Mr Benham murder Alfie, she replied: ""No."" Mark Demain, Alfie's grandfather, said the toddler ""completed our lives"". ""We have never experience pain like this. I would describe it as if the light in our souls have gone out,"" he said. ""Our best friend, our grandson was so cruelly taken from us. Every day we are hurting."" Jurors previously heard about older injuries Alfie sustained in the months prior to his death and their explanations for them, such as a cut under his eye from playing with keys and his fingers being caught in the dog gate in Benham's parents' home. One incident was described in which Hedges described finding blood on the carpet, a cushion and a tissue, but was told Alfie had fallen and hit his mouth on the oil heater. Benham had described how he held Alfie above him but he slipped out of his hands and hit his nose on Benham's teeth, the court heard. Ms Hedges said she was not there and was unaware it had happened. When the pair were found guilty, Det Ch Insp Kathleen Way, of Kent Police, said the verdict would ""not bring Alfie back"", but would mean that ""Hedges and Benham lose their right to freedom and life as they know it"". ""Alfie should have been protected and loved by his mum, instead Hedges and Benham inflicted unimaginable suffering on him during a sustained and lengthy night of violence,"" she added. Following the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Way said Hedges and Benham inflicted ""unimaginable suffering"".

Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December.

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered.

It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded.

""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires.""

Begum pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office and was jailed for 16 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. She had worked at the Category B prison in Winson Green since December 2018.

He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered.

It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded.

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Daisy Bull died in December after being diagnosed with cancer in her kidney three years ago. Hundreds of people stood by the side of roads in Retford in Nottinghamshire to pay their respects to Daisy. Part of the seven-mile route went past Daisy's school, where the children applauded as Daisy's coffin and the convoy went past. Daisy's mum, Sally Bull, said her daughter ""was something else"". ""She was a little bit different from your average 12-year-old,"" Mrs Bull said. ""She loved lorries and went everywhere with her dad in his lorry."" Daisy came from a family of lorry drivers, and her mum thinks she would have grown up to be a professional lorry driver too. Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December. Nick Bull, Daisy's father, said she ""fought so hard and won the first two battles but wasn't strong enough to win the war"". Daisy's coffin was on the back of a green and white Scania 730, driven by her dad, who runs a haulage company. Daisy's uncle drove the lorry behind, and her cousin drove another lorry. Mrs Bull said the funeral convoy was ""very different but very nice"". ""We are a massive lorry family with crazy lorry friends,"" she said.

Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood. Ms James added she had acquired Dugee from someone who bought an emu egg online and hatched it at their home. Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November. Police officers were alerted and helped locate the flightless bird in a residential street close to its home. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

PC Chris Duffy was apprehending Mason Perkins's brother in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March when he was hit by Perkins. The court heard that after the officer fell to the floor, Perkins then also ""pummelled"" his face and body. At Nottingham Crown Court, Perkins was handed an 11-and-a-half year sentence. Warning: A distressing image of PC Duffy's injuries is below PC Duffy, a police dog handler, sustained a ""blow to the head with a relatively heavy object with an edge like a machete, saw or axe"", the court heard on Friday. The officer's injury was described by a forensic pathologist as a ""chop wound"". PC Duffy - who now has a scar from one side of his head to the other - is back on duty. Following an argument at Sunnydale pub, in Mansfield Woodhouse, where Perkins was barred, PC Duffy apprehended Perkins' brother in an alleyway. The court heard Perkins, 25, entered the alleyway and politely asked the officer if he could pass. PC Duffy, believing Perkins was an innocent member of the public, moved to allow him to walk behind. The officer then felt his head being ""violently jolted"" and was thrown to the floor. Perkins next punched and kicked PC Duffy on both sides of the body and face. As the officer got to his feet, Perkins escaped. About 15 minutes later, when PC Duffy was walking back to his car, he spotted Perkins and other officers gave chase and he was arrested. Perkins, of Moor Street, Mansfield, was found with cannabis, scales, and a cannabis grinder on him. Judge Nirmal Shant KC described the officer's injuries as ""grave"". She said: ""You struck the officer when he was not facing you. ""You struck him in a way that jolted him violently on the floor. ""You hit him and punched him and kicked him and bent over him, pummelling him to the side of the face, to the body, then making good your escape."" The judge added the attack had a ""profound effect"" on PC Duffy, saying it had not only left him with physical injuries but psychological injuries too. Perkins had previously admitted grievous bodily harm, supplying cannabis, and offering to supply a Class A drug. Det Sgt Matthew Dumbrell described the attack as ""utterly shocking"" and said the officer was ""fortunate to avoid more serious injuries"". He said: ""I am pleased Perkins will now spend a very considerable length of time in jail, and hope this sentence serves as a warning to others about the consequences of attacking our officers. ""I would also like to place on record my admiration for the officer involved, who in the moments before, during, and after this attack demonstrated so many of the qualities we expect from front-line police officers.""

Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"". Fujitsu, which developed the software at the heart of the affair, said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Bob Child, 79, who ran a post office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, said he personally repaid £600 when the books would not balance 20 years ago. He remembered getting calls from other sub-postmasters who were worried about the same financial issues. He said at the time he had not made the link to the introduction of Horizon. ""When we did the books with a pen and paper, you'd occasionally be a few pounds over or under, but nothing much,"" he said. ""In about 2002, a few years after Horizon was introduced, we had a shortfall of £600. I couldn't understand and repaid it with my own money."" Mr Child, who is now retired and living in Little Downham near Ely, added: ""At the end of the day, your contract said you had to make good. ""I would say there must be hundreds of people out there who never went to court because they used their own money to make it up."" He said friends who ran other post offices would call him to tell of similar problems. ""When Horizon came in, we used to cash up on a Wednesday,"" said Mr Child. ""Postmasters were ringing me up at eight o'clock on a Wednesday night, saying, 'Bob, I've got a problem. I can't balance my books. I'm £300 in arrears. What am I going to do?'"" More than 900 workers across the country were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches. Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Victims of the Post Office scandal have been promised swift exoneration and compensation by the government. Mr Child told the BBC: ""It was puzzling but at the time, no-one questioned the system. Funnily, it was always a shortfall. I've never heard of anyone being over."" He said he wondered what had happened to the money he repaid. ""My understanding is that it went into a suspended account,"" he said. ""Then after two or three years, it moved into Post Office accounts."" Mr Child said using the Horizon system was often problematic. ""From the time it came in, it was so slow,"" he said. ""It could take hours to cash up - much longer that when we did it on paper."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Lorraine Warren, 61, from Saltash, was taken to hospital after falling unwell on 2 January. She waited with paramedics for 10 hours before she was handed over to A&E staff. University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust said: ""We apologise for the wait this patient experienced."" Those arriving at the hospital by ambulance are facing the longest handover delays in England. David Wood, Ms Warren's fiance, told BBC Radio Devon their experience was ""horrendous"". ""[It was] very uncomfortable, stressful and not good for her when she needed urgent treatment,"" he said. ""It's not good for the ambulance crews either because they are not doing the jobs they want to do, which is being out on the road helping people."" Ms Warren suffers from conditions affecting her liver and stomach which Mr Wood said could cause her to go into a coma if not treated quickly. Her 10-hour wait to be seen came during a ""critical incident"" at Derriford Hospital which officials said was in response to severe pressure. According to NHS data released last week, nearly 80% of patients at hospitals in Plymouth waited longer than 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E staff between 25 and 31 December. It should only take 15 minutes. A University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust spokeswoman said the situation had since improved at Derriford Hospital. ""Waiting times in the first week in January were one of the reasons we called a critical incident,"" she said.

New rules in England and Wales mean XL bully dogs must be kept on a lead and muzzled and, from February, owners must have an exemption certificate. Dog trainer Jack Fenton said some of his clients had been shouted at while out walking their dogs, even if not part of the newly banned breed. The government said the new rules aimed to ""reduce the risks to the public"". Guidance has been published to help identify XL bullies, which are not recognised as a specific breed by the UK Kennel Club. Mr Fenton, from Southbourne, Dorset, said: ""I've had students come to me with dogs that do not fall under the classification of XL bullies - they might be Staffordshire bull terriers or American bullies - and they are scared to take their dogs down the street. ""I've had students of mine say people have crossed the road and they have been yelled at that their dog is dangerous, that their dog should be muzzled. ""It's affecting lots of people who don't even have XL bullies."" Professional dog walker Jess Eley, also from Southbourne, has a three-year-old rescue dog, Dora, who she describes as ""super friendly"". She said: ""Dora is classed as a bully XL but she's smaller - she just falls under the government's definition. ""She's often the most well-behaved dog in the dog park. ""Since the ban was announced, people cross the road, we get a lot of stares."" Ms Eley said Dora used to join her on her group walks but now gets confused about why she is not allowed to run and play with the other dogs. She now walks Dora alone to give her time to adjust to being on a lead and wearing a muzzle. ""We've gone to quieter places where there's less people and less dogs,"" she said. There are no official statistics on attacks by particular dog breeds in the UK. Surgeons at one plastic surgery unit in West Sussex say they are treating double the number of dog-attack victims since before the pandemic. The government said, before 2021 there were about three fatalities a year caused by dog attacks but in the last three years there had been 23 deaths, ""with the XL bully being disproportionately involved in this rise"". The Dog Control Coalition, which includes the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, the Dogs Trust, the Kennel Club, the RSPCA and the British Veterinary Association, said breed-specific bans do not work and are unfair on responsible owners and their animals.

The government issued a writ for Wellingborough to replace Peter Bone, who lost the seat following a sexual misconduct scandal. Chris Skidmore, who resigned over the government's plans to boost oil and gas drilling in the North Sea, will also be replaced as MP for Kingswood. Both polls will be held on 15 February. Mr Skidmore said he had ""no regrets"" about leaving Parliament. The former MP for Kingswood, near Bristol, formally quit the Commons on Monday after announcing last week that he was resigning the Conservative whip over the government's plans to issue new oil and gas licences. Mr Skidmore said he had found himself increasingly at odds with government policy on the environment over the past 18 months. Labour has already started campaigning in Mr Skidmore's seat. Damien Egan, Labour's candidate who resigned as mayor of Lewisham on Wednesday, grew up in the constituency. Mr Skidmore took the seat from Labour in 2010 and secured an 11,220 vote majority in the 2019 general election. Mr Bone lost his seat after being removed by constituents last month in a recall petition, signed by more than 10% of his constituents. He had previously been suspended from the Commons over bullying and sexual misconduct claims. Parliament's behaviour watchdog found Mr Bone had exposed himself to an aide and physically struck him. Mr Bone denies the allegations. The 71-year-old was first elected for Wellingborough in 2005, growing his party's share of the vote to an 18,540 majority in 2019. But Prime Minister Rishis Sunak has admitted the by-election will be ""difficult"" for the Tories. The majority is smaller than those the Tories had in both Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire, which were both lost to Labour in by-elections last October. Mr Bone could stand as an independent candidate. But this is thought unlikely as the Conservative Party has selected Mr Bone's partner Helen Harrison as its candidate. Gen Kitchen will be standing for the Labour Party and Ana Savage Gunn will represent the Liberal Democrats. The Green Party candidate is Will Morris.","['Wellingborough', 'Bristol', 'Chris Skidmore', 'Peter Bone']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E356/production/_132089185_peterbonemppa.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16163/production/_132276409_skidmore_pa.jpg']","['By Sam Francis', 'Political reporter, BBC News']",UK,England

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce5jjgxke3no,Community picking up the pieces from devastating floods,,2024-01-12,"A week after devastating floods hit Somerset, one community is still cleaning up its village. Croscombe, near Wells, was severely hit by the floods in early January, with waters reaching heights of four feet as the River Sheppy burst its banks.Many of the villagers still have their personal belongings outside on the street, after the waters broke through their doors and flooded their homes.Now, residents fear flooding could become more regular as the effects of climate change are felt. Jill Pettit lives on the bank of the river and told BBC Somerset she was used to small levels of flooding, and on this occasion did not put her flood barrier out.However, she said in the space of 90 minutes, the ground floor of her home was submerged with four feet of water.""It was rushing in the front door as well as the back door,"" she said,""I couldn't open my front door. I was shouting to people outside saying 'help me! Can you open my door for me?' but they couldn't so I went upstairs.""All the lights had gone out by that point and there was no heating, so I just went to bed."" Ms Pettit added she tried and failed to get downstairs at midnight, but by the morning was able to see the damage.Nothing works in her home now, she explained, with most of her belongings either upstairs, or drying out on tables.""Personally, I'm feeling a little bit displaced. I'm not sure where I am, where I'm going to work.""She said she now worries climate change could make flooding worse and more common, and wants the county council to do more to prevent it. Across the village, Ollie Baker, the chef at The George Inn said: ""I've never seen anything like it.""It was flowing so fast. It's normally a lovely little stream that flows through and past people's houses but... it was pretty traumatic.""He added the road was completely flooded, with videos showing water levels coming up over car bonnets and bins floating through the village.The river wall, which comes up around six feet from the river bed, could not be seen when the levels peaked.Mr Baker said his pub, which is in the centre of the village opposite the river, saw up to two feet of water inside all of a sudden, adding a team of volunteers came round as levels subsided to help try and reopen the venue.He told BBC Somerset on the morning after, the village looked like a ""bomb site"".""There was debris, and people's possessions and wheelie bins and things everywhere,"" he said. Several houses in the village still have sofas and mattresses outside, but several volunteers helped clear the pub the following day so it could open.Me Baker said the mood in the village is ""pretty hopeful"", adding people are ""still continuing to help as much as they can"". Somerset Council said: ""The physical and emotional impacts to families, communities and livelihoods because of flood water can be devastating and long-lasting.""Unfortunately, we will never be able to stop flooding from happening, but we can try to understand the risks in an attempt to reduce the danger to people and property.

Matthew Syron, 32, said he lost his sight instantly at Revolucion de Cuba in the early hours of 27 December. Mr Syron, who is originally from Leeds and now lives in Australia, has been unable to return home to his fiancée and their two young children. Surgery on his right eye on Tuesday ""went well"", but doctors told him there were ""no guarantees"" about his sight. ""This is a very, very emotional rollercoaster,"" said Mr Syron, who had been home for Christmas visiting family and friends when he lost his vision. ""I'm not really an emotional guy, [but] this has had me on my knees praying every night just for some sort of way out."" Mr Syron said he could only see ""lights, colours [and] blurs"" in his left eye, adding: ""There's so much damage there that it's going to take a year to heal."" The only vision in his right eye is a red-coloured dye following the five-hour operation, which has left him in ""excruciating"" pain. ""They are trying their best to get some sort of sight but there are no guarantees,"" Mr Syron said. ""It's just a long game, it's very tough."" Originally from Kirkstall, the self-employed electrician had initially planned to visit home for a fortnight but may have to stay in the UK for another two months during recovery. His fiancée Keone, 30, and their two children Brixon, two, and Meka, who turns one in March, remain in Wollongong, New South Wales. ""My kids send me voice notes every day, my son still thinks I'm out running,"" said Mr Syron, a keen runner who plans to take part in the Sydney Marathon with Keone in September. ""My kids don't really know what's going on, which is great - I don't really want them to see me hurt or like this."" He was optimistic he would see again, adding: ""I believe I'll get there, there are some positive signs. ""I will get some sort of sight back, they just can't give me a percentage."" Gareth Dean, 37, of Elm Tree Close, Leeds, has been charged with GBH with intent in relation to the incident. He is due to appear at Leeds Crown Court on 1 February.

Phil Robinson said his mother sold her bungalow in Madeley, Staffordshire, on what was expected to become phase 2a of the line. He claimed it was now ""uninhabitable"", while other homes in the village had been taken over by squatters. The government said it was ""continuing to develop a clear programme for selling land no longer needed"". Fred Smith, who lived in nearby Whitmore, said others residents who did not sell their properties for HS2 had become ""imprisoned in their own homes"" because they could not now sell. The planned high-speed rail route from Birmingham to Manchester would have gone through Staffordshire and Cheshire, but that section of the line was cancelled by the government last autumn. The bungalow belonging to Mr Robinson's mother was one of about 50 bought by the government around Madeley in 2017 to make way for the line. Mr Robinson said: ""When my mother was living down here on her own I came down every day. ""My dad loved it down here. It's a beautiful place, but it will be uninhabitable now."" He said he would not want the home back and would refuse any offer to sell it to him because the money was needed to pay for his mother's care home. Mr Smith said the route would have taken the railway line through the end of his garden and added: ""We were going to be effectively sitting on a tunnel."" He did not have to sell his home and said the cancellation of the northern section of the line had ""come as some relief"". Mr Robinson said he was also aware of empty homes with squatters in them and knew several people in his village who were forced to sell. But he said: ""There have been a number of people almost imprisoned in their own homes because they can't sell them and they couldn't get the price they needed. ""There are a number of really, really sad stories."" A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""We're continuing to develop a clear programme for selling land no longer needed for Phase 2 of HS2, ensuring our approach provides value for the taxpayer and fully engages with the people and communities affected.""

The authority has decided leader Mike Bell can submit the full business case for the long-awaited scheme to the Department for Transport (DfT). An operator would need to build two new stations at Pill and Portishead. Mr Bell is expected to submit the business case in February. He said: ""The new line stands to be transformative for both North Somerset and the region. ""By connecting 50,000 residents back into the rail network, it will provide better connections for Portishead and Pill, but it will offer green alternatives to getting around, cutting road traffic with expected train journeys of around 20-25 minutes."" Spades from construction company, VolkerFitzpatrick could be in the ground by August if plans are approved by Department for Transport (DfT). The project's price tag of £152m has been funded by the West of England Combined Authority (WECA), DfT and North Somerset Council but it will be down to the government to cover any unexpected extra costs. Mr Bell said: ""We have played our part with local resources, and we now expect the Department of Transport to take responsibility for any capital delivery risk or cost pressures going forward,"" reported the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Portishead East councillor Roger Whitfield added: ""The people of Portishead and Pill have been crying out for this railway link for as long as I can remember — almost since it was closed in the 1960s. ""I am sure everyone here knows how much residential development has taken place in Portishead over the last 25 years, with little or no associated improvements in the road networks. ""So I hope you can all understand that the people of Portishead feel that they are owned this significant public transport upgrade."" Councillor Peter Burden warned: ""Portishead Railway Station reopening has been five years in the future from every regional assembly meeting I attended in the early 2000s. ""Now, hopefully we are there but - I'm sorry but like a lot of other people in Portishead we have our fingers crossed - but pardon us for being cynical.""

Saidi Hussain, 24, was described as having ""no regard for his victim"" by prosecutors after ignoring the 17-year-old's pleas to stop the assault at a shop in Bootle, Merseyside in 2022. He originally denied any sexual contact but after DNA samples were found he said it was consensual, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Hussain was sentenced to nine years after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Jurors heard how he had given the girl vapes on a number of occasions and she said he had ""seemed friendly"". On 5 March 2022, he had given her another free vape and she left the shop but returned with a friend to ask if she could get another vape for him. Hussain then told her to follow him into the back of the shop while he got the product, which she did ""out of trust"", the CPS said. He instead attacked her, ignoring her pleas for him to stop. The CPS said Hussain denied any sexual contact however DNA samples from the victim's clothing matched his and he changed his story to say all sexual activity was consensual. He was found guilty of two counts of rape and sexual assault. Hussain will remain on the sex offenders' register indefinitely and a restraining order prevents him from contacting the victim. Senior Crown Prosecutor Sarah Egan said: ""Saidi Hussain had no regard for his victim, only his own sexual gratification. ""We would like to thank her for the courage and strength she has shown throughout the proceedings, as well as the other parties involved who have helped us bring this prosecution to a successful conclusion.""

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-67955303,Alfie Phillips murder: Life sentence for mum and partner who killed toddler,"A mother and her former partner have been given life sentences for the murder of her 18-month-old son during ""a lengthy night of violence"".",2024-01-12,"A mother and her former partner have been given life sentences for the murder of her 18-month-old son during ""a lengthy night of violence"". Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years. Justice Cavanagh said in his sentencing remarks that Alfie had been the victim of a ""frenzied attack"" in which he suffered about 50 injuries on the night of his death. He said to Hedges: ""You were Alfie's mother and he deserved your protection."" Sam Phillips, Alfie's father, described him as ""good as gold"" and ""lively"", adding he had been ""robbed of the opportunity to see him grown up"". ""The funeral was one of the hardest days of my lives. The images of his tiny coffin will stay with me forever,"" he said. Hedges, of Yelverton, Devon, and Benham, killed Alfie overnight during lockdown in Benham's caravan in Hernhill, near Faversham. During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body. The court heard that on the night before Alfie died, Hedges went to buy drugs from their friend and repay her £400 debt, and also get mixers and drinks for their evening together in the caravan. Benham told police he bit Alfie on his back and shook him the morning he found him unresponsive in an attempt to rouse him, the jury heard. The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner. Asked if she had seen Mr Benham murder Alfie, she replied: ""No."" Mark Demain, Alfie's grandfather, said the toddler ""completed our lives"". ""We have never experience pain like this. I would describe it as if the light in our souls have gone out,"" he said. ""Our best friend, our grandson was so cruelly taken from us. Every day we are hurting."" Jurors previously heard about older injuries Alfie sustained in the months prior to his death and their explanations for them, such as a cut under his eye from playing with keys and his fingers being caught in the dog gate in Benham's parents' home. One incident was described in which Hedges described finding blood on the carpet, a cushion and a tissue, but was told Alfie had fallen and hit his mouth on the oil heater. Benham had described how he held Alfie above him but he slipped out of his hands and hit his nose on Benham's teeth, the court heard. Ms Hedges said she was not there and was unaware it had happened. When the pair were found guilty, Det Ch Insp Kathleen Way, of Kent Police, said the verdict would ""not bring Alfie back"", but would mean that ""Hedges and Benham lose their right to freedom and life as they know it"".

Daisy Bull died in December after being diagnosed with cancer in her kidney three years ago. Hundreds of people stood by the side of roads in Retford in Nottinghamshire to pay their respects to Daisy. Part of the seven-mile route went past Daisy's school, where the children applauded as Daisy's coffin and the convoy went past. Daisy's mum, Sally Bull, said her daughter ""was something else"". ""She was a little bit different from your average 12-year-old,"" Mrs Bull said. ""She loved lorries and went everywhere with her dad in his lorry."" Daisy came from a family of lorry drivers, and her mum thinks she would have grown up to be a professional lorry driver too. Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December. Nick Bull, Daisy's father, said she ""fought so hard and won the first two battles but wasn't strong enough to win the war"". Daisy's coffin was on the back of a green and white Scania 730, driven by her dad, who runs a haulage company. Daisy's uncle drove the lorry behind, and her cousin drove another lorry. Mrs Bull said the funeral convoy was ""very different but very nice"". ""We are a massive lorry family with crazy lorry friends,"" she said.

""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

Shania Begum, 25, from Leegomery, Telford, carried out the inappropriate relationship with the male prisoner at HMP Birmingham. She took him into private areas of the prison and claimed she was supervising him, West Midlands Police said. But staff became suspicious and she was caught in the act after an investigation. Begum pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in a public office and was jailed for 16 months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. She had worked at the Category B prison in Winson Green since December 2018. When she claimed to be supervising the prisoner, they instead had sex when they could not be seen by other officers or inmates, the force said. Begum was arrested on 3 October 2022 and refused to answer any questions from detectives.

Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December.

Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood. Ms James added she had acquired Dugee from someone who bought an emu egg online and hatched it at their home. Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November. Police officers were alerted and helped locate the flightless bird in a residential street close to its home. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered. Set in mature woodlands, an orchard and rolling fields, it sits behind electric gates and is framed by a stone-walled, Italianate garden. It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing."" Mr Maher also has two sons, aged 32 and 27, and a grandchild, aged two, from his first marriage. He has been working in the IT industry for the past 25 years and his wife Amanda, 54, is a school administrative assistant. He said he was ""overjoyed"" when he learned of his win. ""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires."" Omaze said the draw also raised £3.5m for the RSPCA, the UK's largest and oldest animal welfare charity. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Bob Child, 79, who ran a post office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, said he personally repaid £600 when the books would not balance 20 years ago. He remembered getting calls from other sub-postmasters who were worried about the same financial issues. He said at the time he had not made the link to the introduction of Horizon. ""When we did the books with a pen and paper, you'd occasionally be a few pounds over or under, but nothing much,"" he said. ""In about 2002, a few years after Horizon was introduced, we had a shortfall of £600. I couldn't understand and repaid it with my own money."" Mr Child, who is now retired and living in Little Downham near Ely, added: ""At the end of the day, your contract said you had to make good. ""I would say there must be hundreds of people out there who never went to court because they used their own money to make it up."" He said friends who ran other post offices would call him to tell of similar problems. ""When Horizon came in, we used to cash up on a Wednesday,"" said Mr Child. ""Postmasters were ringing me up at eight o'clock on a Wednesday night, saying, 'Bob, I've got a problem. I can't balance my books. I'm £300 in arrears. What am I going to do?'"" More than 900 workers across the country were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches. Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Victims of the Post Office scandal have been promised swift exoneration and compensation by the government. Mr Child told the BBC: ""It was puzzling but at the time, no-one questioned the system. Funnily, it was always a shortfall. I've never heard of anyone being over."" He said he wondered what had happened to the money he repaid. ""My understanding is that it went into a suspended account,"" he said. ""Then after two or three years, it moved into Post Office accounts."" Mr Child said using the Horizon system was often problematic. ""From the time it came in, it was so slow,"" he said.

PC Chris Duffy was apprehending Mason Perkins's brother in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March when he was hit by Perkins. The court heard that after the officer fell to the floor, Perkins then also ""pummelled"" his face and body. At Nottingham Crown Court, Perkins was handed an 11-and-a-half year sentence. Warning: A distressing image of PC Duffy's injuries is below PC Duffy, a police dog handler, sustained a ""blow to the head with a relatively heavy object with an edge like a machete, saw or axe"", the court heard on Friday. The officer's injury was described by a forensic pathologist as a ""chop wound"". PC Duffy - who now has a scar from one side of his head to the other - is back on duty. Following an argument at Sunnydale pub, in Mansfield Woodhouse, where Perkins was barred, PC Duffy apprehended Perkins' brother in an alleyway. The court heard Perkins, 25, entered the alleyway and politely asked the officer if he could pass. PC Duffy, believing Perkins was an innocent member of the public, moved to allow him to walk behind. The officer then felt his head being ""violently jolted"" and was thrown to the floor. Perkins next punched and kicked PC Duffy on both sides of the body and face. As the officer got to his feet, Perkins escaped. About 15 minutes later, when PC Duffy was walking back to his car, he spotted Perkins and other officers gave chase and he was arrested. Perkins, of Moor Street, Mansfield, was found with cannabis, scales, and a cannabis grinder on him. Judge Nirmal Shant KC described the officer's injuries as ""grave"". She said: ""You struck the officer when he was not facing you. ""You struck him in a way that jolted him violently on the floor. ""You hit him and punched him and kicked him and bent over him, pummelling him to the side of the face, to the body, then making good your escape."" The judge added the attack had a ""profound effect"" on PC Duffy, saying it had not only left him with physical injuries but psychological injuries too. Perkins had previously admitted grievous bodily harm, supplying cannabis, and offering to supply a Class A drug. Det Sgt Matthew Dumbrell described the attack as ""utterly shocking"" and said the officer was ""fortunate to avoid more serious injuries"". He said: ""I am pleased Perkins will now spend a very considerable length of time in jail, and hope this sentence serves as a warning to others about the consequences of attacking our officers. ""I would also like to place on record my admiration for the officer involved, who in the moments before, during, and after this attack demonstrated so many of the qualities we expect from front-line police officers.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-67961443,Post Office inquiry: 'My wife died not knowing who was stealing',A former sub-postmaster has said his wife died not knowing who was stealing money from the Post Office she ran.,2024-01-12,"A former sub-postmaster has said his wife died not knowing who was stealing money from the Post Office she ran. John Heath's wife, Helen, ran a Post Office in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and was one of hundreds of people accused in the Post Office scandal. ""She [Helen] died not knowing whether it was a member of her family that was stealing from her [or] one of her friends who were our employees. ""She had no idea. She carried that to her grave and that is unforgivable."" More than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software, called Horizon, made it look like money was missing from their branches. ""The Post Office destroyed my family,"" said Mr Heath, who lives in Melksham. He explained the software installed in the branch ""would come out with random figures"" when his wife tried to balance the books each Wednesday. When they phoned the helpline they were always told 'you're the only people having this problem'. Mr Heath's daughter, Vikki, said: ""The big tragedy in our family situation is that my mum went to her grave thinking that people were stealing and that is awful. ""That is something that me and my family will have to live with."" Following a campaign by former postmaster Alan Bates - recently dramatised for ITV - Mr Heath realised they were not alone. He said that following his wife's death he was appointed to run the branch without any training. He and his son, who also worked there, had ""exactly the same problems"" as his wife. Ms Heath explained that her father had ""suffered hugely"". ""He has had two strokes since the whole thing started. His mental and physical health has deteriorated hugely,"" she said. Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"". Fujitsu, which developed the software at the heart of the affair, said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Beatriz, who the BBC is only referring to by her first name, said that in 2020 she found an insect on her pillow at her Toppham Way home and disposed of it.A few months later, one of her children woke up one morning ""totally covered in bites"".She said: ""When I went to check the bed, inside and underneath there were hundreds of the same bugs that I found on my pillow.""I went online to check if I could find out what they were and that's when I found they were bedbugs.""Sheffield Council arranged treatments but the infestation returned, she said.Beatriz said the whole family had received lots of bites, saying they were ""so so itchy, it burns you"".She said: ""I feel depressed, I feel tired. I am exhausted, completely exhausted.""She said she now wanted the authority to move them somewhere else as the treatments were not solving the problem.She said: ""They are inside plugs on the wall, they are under floorboards, they are inside the walls in the property and at this point I just want to move out."" Sheffield City Council said further treatment would be carried out in the next few days.Councillor Douglas Johnson, chair of the housing policy committee, said: ""We know how distressing it must be for anyone to be experiencing bed bugs in their home.""We have been treating the property and the surrounding properties, and we will continue with treatment until the issue is resolved.""Beatriz's experience comes amid increased reports of bedbugs in the UK and Europe.Pest control technician Paul Spiers, from West Yorkshire-based Copley Pest Solutions, said they had seen a rise in callouts about the creatures this year. He said bedbugs now accounted for 20% to 30% of their workload.He said: ""The initial telltale signs will be customers getting bitten, front or back, when they are laying down.""He said people might also see specks of blood on their bedding. He said there was often a stigma that came with having a bedbug infestation, but they were not linked to a lack of cleanliness.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, external, X (formerly Twitter), external and Instagram, external.

It has been the wettest recorded year for the Hampshire Avon, which runs through Britford near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Some people left their homes and there is still a road closed in the village, the site of three river channels. The Environment Agency said river has already had about 60 per cent of the rainfall typical for January. ""The Hampshire Avon has had it wettest 12 months on record,"" said an agency spokesperson, adding that records go back to 1871. The area around Britford still has a flood warning attached to it after the recent heavy rain. Chair of the Parish Council and resident of 40 years, Derek Finnis, called it ""an exceptional event."" He said the flooding was bad enough that at one stage he ""thought of windsurfing to Tesco"". Several houses have flooded, with sandbags saving more, and Mr Finnis said the community spirit has been strong. ""All the residents have pulled together- the community's spirit has been astonishing, more than any other time in my recollection,"" he said. Brian Wheeler, who has lived in Britford for 20 years, said: ""Someone volunteered their tractor which was very helpful. People rang each other up, there's a village Whatsapp [group] - people offered to help with shopping and getting kids to school."" Mr Finnis said a combination of factors has led to the current flooding being particularly bad, including waterlogged ground, very high rainfall and blocked waterways. Mr Wheeler - as well as also being on the parish council - runs a dredging company and has concerns that one of the three river channels is blocked or restricted. Locals say they feel more needs to be done, including restoring a river bank, clearing channels of weeds and dredging. Mr Finnis explained: ""It is a thorny issue and it is not reserved to Britford."" The Environment Agency said it met with representatives from the village last year. ""We are continuing to engage with the community and provide support where we are able to. The responsibility for maintenance of watercourses is for landowners,"" it said in a statement. It said that water from last week's rainfall is still making its way down the rivers courses, which means a flood risk remains in some places. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The initiative follows on from its success on Botley Road. Guests to the launch event on Thursday included Lord Mayor of Oxford Lubna Arshad who cut a ribbon to mark the occasion. Mr Jamshidifard started Botley Community Kitchen Surplus Curry, which uses the hashtag #SurplusCurry on social media, last year. Free meals are cooked at Seacourt Bridge pub and served at St Frideswide Church on Fridays. He said he and his team of volunteers had realised that to reduce food waste ""cooking one curry in one place, once a week, doesn't do it"". Mr Jamshidifard, who works as a lecturer at Oxford Brookes Business School, has been involved in many surplus and food waste initiatives. The ingredients he uses come from Oxford Food Hub which provides surplus food to more than 200 charity groups. He said he was now looking for volunteers locally to Wood Farm to cook. ""It's more sustainable when the volunteers are local to it,"" he added. He said between 100 and 150 people attended his curry days. ""By having conversations about the surplus, you fix a lot of other social issues as a by-product,"" he said. ""I'd rather say, 'you're helping me reduce waste by joining this initiative and when you do that as a side effect of it, you reduce your loneliness as well'.""

Sammy Wilkinson, from Tipton, has transported dozens of dogs to Scotland as tighter laws on their ownership were introduced in England and Wales.First Minister Humza Yousaf has since said the Scottish government will replicate the law which bans the breed without a licence.Mr Wilkinson said the welfare of animals was at the forefront of his mind. He said dogs had been dumped or abandoned in England as a result of the law change and the Scottish government had not learnt anything from it.He has not just been rehoming in Scotland. He said he had also taken dogs across England to where owners could take them in according to the restrictions.When the Scottish ban comes into effect, he said, he may look to go further afield, and has been contacted by a German charity which is willing to help.  “I haven’t taken a particular interest in Scotland, I’ve rehomed everywhere.""I’ve rehomed south in Plymouth, Portsmouth, as long as the dog is vetted and the home has been checked out and it is a compatible dog with a compatible owner, I’m happy to keep rehoming them,"" he said. In order to keep a bully XL in England and Wales, owners must have the dog microchipped, neutered, kept on a lead and muzzled in public.  Owners must be over 16, have insurance against their dog injuring other people and have applied for a Certificate of Exemption.Mr Wilkinson previously said he believed some owners had been irresponsible in taking on the dogs in the first place.

A report for Sandwell Council showed 144 children died in the area from 2019-23, with 40 in the past year. Across the same four years, 99 were recorded in Dudley, 96 in Walsall and 24 in Wolverhampton. The issue was discussed by councillors examining Sandwell's response to serious safeguarding incidents. The 40 child deaths in Sandwell in the last 12 months compared to 35 in Dudley, 29 in Walsall and 24 in Wolverhampton. Gillian Ming from the Sandwell Children's Safeguarding Partnership told councillors the area had had the highest number of child deaths for several years. ""If we look further afield, we're not the highest but we're certainly not the lowest,"" she added. Serious safeguarding incidents are where a child is known or suspected to have been abused or neglected and the child has died or been seriously harmed. The safeguarding partnership is made up of representatives from Sandwell Council, Sandwell Children's Trust, West Midlands Police and the NHS Black Country Integrated Care Board. The partnership rules whether serious incidents have passed the threshold to be reviewed and higher authorities, such as Ofsted and the Department for Education, are notified. A ""rapid review"" is then held to investigate any concerns and highlight any issues. Of 20 serious incidents investigated in Sandwell since April 2019, two-thirds warranted further investigation, councillors heard. All of the reviewed cases showed worrying issues with communication and information sharing between the children's trust, police, the NHS and other agencies, they were told. There were three ""rapid reviews"" last year, figures revealed, and a further three took place since April with three months remaining in the 2023-24 year.

Gillian Bolton, then a young girl, was at school when the crash happened and remembers how local residents reacted.“Everywhere you went in town over that weekend, the talk was all about the plane crash,” she said.Ms Bolton explained the sound of aircraft overhead was not unusual during the war, but the noise from Lt Brown’s Thunderbolt P47D was so loud it brought many people outside to see what was going on.Her mother told her the plane had been flying dangerously low, and that it soon became apparent it was going to crash.“We had listened to mother in horrified silence,” she said. “The war had never felt so close.” Ms Bolton and the St Mary’s Church Brownie group would later tend to the airman’s memorial, put in place after the crash.Lt Brown’s award of the freedom of the town is the first to be handed out in Nantwich, and is the highest honour the town council can bestow.A spokesperson for the town council said: “It is testament to his act of such bravery that his story continues to live on.“The young American pilot’s fate has become interwoven with the town’s history.” A service will take place from 10:45 GMT on Sunday at St Mary’s Church, followed by a procession led by the Cheshire Constabulary Police Band before a short ceremony takes place at the site of the memorial behind Shrewbridge Road.","['Nantwich', 'Cheshire', 'World War Two', 'US Armed Forces']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/5cdc/live/ff87f520-b134-11ee-a24d-5371dfbad329.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/d4cd/live/fdd7f3d0-b137-11ee-a24d-5371dfbad329.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/668a/live/f0773a80-b136-11ee-a24d-5371dfbad329.jpg']","['Ethan Saunders', 'Reporter, BBC Radio Stoke']",UK,England

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-67916152,"Dog attacks: Victims double since pandemic, surgeon says",Surgeons at a plastic surgery unit in West Sussex say they are treating double the number of dog-attack victims since before the pandemic.,2024-01-12,"Surgeons at a plastic surgery unit in West Sussex say they are treating double the number of dog-attack victims since before the pandemic. The number of admissions at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead rose from 116 in 2019 to 237 in 2022. Siva Kumar, a consultant surgeon, said he had seen an increase in the number of bites as dog ownership rose during the pandemic. The government says it is working with police to prevent attacks. This article contains pictures and descriptions of dogs bites that some readers may find upsetting. Mr Kumar, whose trauma clinics treat patients from Kent, Surrey and Sussex, told BBC South East the specialist centre would often see the most severe cases. He said: ""We would get at least one, if not two patients that are dog bites every day. We have seen a doubling in the number of patients that have come through and in the last year we've seen double the number of children that have had dog bites. ""Children are probably the ones that affect you the most. Ones with multiple dog bites with scarring that they will carry through the rest of their lives."" National data from NHS Digital also shows there has been a steady increase in the number of hospital admissions for dog bites over the last 10 years. There were 9,277 in 2022-23, up 47% from 6,317 in 2012-13. There has been a much smaller increase in admissions for under-18s for dog bites, up by 8% to 1,740 in the same time period. Although these figures show a rise in admissions for dog bites, one bite can result in multiple admissions and it may not include all dog bites that resulted in hospital admission. Darren Davies, 53, suffered serious hand injuries in December after intervening when a dog he was walking was attacked by another, near to his home in Staplehurst. ""I didn't even see it,"" he said. ""I had the dog by the back of the neck with two hands, the dog managed to spin round so quickly, and bite me, that I didn't even see him do it, it was just so fast, and he bit me. ""I knew something was really bad. It goes right across the top of my hand."" He was treated at the Queen Victoria Hospital for his injuries. ""It's the worst injury I think I have ever had in my life,"" he added. Kerry Stevens from Eastbourne needed several operations at the Queen Victoria Hospital. She said she was still scarred psychologically after she was attacked by a cross between a pit bull and an American bulldog in 2014. ""I was delivering a package to a property when the dog came running out, knocked me to the floor and locked its jaw on me,"" she said. ""There were bits of my flesh on the floor, it was terrifying, I feared I could have died."" Kerry said that while the scars may heal, she still remembered the attack ""every so often"". ""There should be more muzzling brought into place for dogs that could be like that,"" she added. Last year a BBC investigation found the number of dog attacks recorded by police in England and Wales had risen by more than a third in the previous five years. The government says there have been 23 deaths caused by dog attacks since the start of 2021, with the bully XL breed ""being disproportionately involved in this rise"". The new rules for owning bully XL dogs are being introduced in England and Wales. They must now be kept on a lead and muzzled in public and from 1 February it will be illegal to own one without an exemption certificate. Charities are calling for a complete overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act, including tougher penalties for owners who fail to control their dogs. Dog behaviourist and trainer Pippa Apps from Kent suggested some dogs bought during the pandemic had not been properly socialised and that could be a factor in the number of dog bites. She said: ""The critical period of socialisation is up to four months of age and without socialising with dogs, and experiencing other dogs in a really positive way in that time, they are much less able to cope as well in a social setting as they get older."" A government spokesperson said:  ""We are focused on ensuring that the full range of existing powers to tackle dog control issues are effectively applied across all breeds of dog. ""We have also taken quick and decisive action to protect the public from devastating dog attacks by adding the bully XL type to the list of dogs prohibited under the Dangerous Dogs Act to reduce the risks to the public posed by this type.""

Motorists have faced overnight closures on a section of the A46 between Six Hills and Widmerpool in Leicestershire since September. Overnight closures will continue on the northbound and southbound carriageways until 25 January. Contraflows will then be used from 26 January to enable work on the last three sections of road to be completed. National Highways project manager Kyle Morley said: ""This scheme will result in smoother, safer journeys for road users by extending the life of the concrete carriageway. ""The work is progressing well and the installation of the contraflow means we can now work round the clock to complete the project more quickly for the benefit of road users and local communities and businesses, especially those who front directly on to the A46. ""Once the contraflow is in place, we are advising road users to be alert to the changing road layout, to allow extra time for their journeys and to adhere to the 40mph temporary speed limit which is there for their safety as well as that of our workforce."" Part of the A46 will close overnight when the contraflow is moved to a new section of road as work progresses. Traffic will be diverted along the A606 and A607 through Melton Mowbray or the A52 eastbound to Grantham, the A1 southbound to the Harlaxton turn off and the A607 towards Melton Mowbray. Leicestershire County Council is also planning its own diversions in Melton over the next two weeks, but National Highways said the diversion for traffic from the A46 would be clearly signposted. Some slip roads will also be closed when the contraflows are moved. Access to the A46 from properties and businesses will remain open and free recovery will also be in place for motorists while the work is carried out.

The victims were taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries from the shooting on 18 December at The Arcadian's Portrait Bar.

A representative from the force told the sub-committee it had been an ""invasive and difficult process"" for the bar to go through, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. ""It's a very detailed examination of the way they conduct their business,"" he continued.

Councillor Phil Davis confirmed that the conditions agreed between the police and licence would be ""adopted as interim steps pending the full summary review hearing"".

During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body.

The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner.

Jurors previously heard about older injuries Alfie sustained in the months prior to his death and their explanations for them, such as a cut under his eye from playing with keys and his fingers being caught in the dog gate in Benham's parents' home. One incident was described in which Hedges described finding blood on the carpet, a cushion and a tissue, but was told Alfie had fallen and hit his mouth on the oil heater. Benham had described how he held Alfie above him but he slipped out of his hands and hit his nose on Benham's teeth, the court heard. Ms Hedges said she was not there and was unaware it had happened. When the pair were found guilty, Det Ch Insp Kathleen Way, of Kent Police, said the verdict would ""not bring Alfie back"", but would mean that ""Hedges and Benham lose their right to freedom and life as they know it"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-67955303,Alfie Phillips murder: Life sentence for mum and partner who killed toddler,"A mother and her former partner have been given life sentences for the murder of her 18-month-old son during ""a lengthy night of violence"".",2024-01-12,"A mother and her former partner have been given life sentences for the murder of her 18-month-old son during ""a lengthy night of violence"". Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years. Justice Cavanagh said in his sentencing remarks that Alfie had been the victim of a ""frenzied attack"" in which he suffered about 50 injuries on the night of his death. He said to Hedges: ""You were Alfie's mother and he deserved your protection."" Sam Phillips, Alfie's father, described him as ""good as gold"" and ""lively"", adding he had been ""robbed of the opportunity to see him grown up"". ""The funeral was one of the hardest days of my lives. The images of his tiny coffin will stay with me forever,"" he said. Hedges, of Yelverton, Devon, and Benham, killed Alfie overnight during lockdown in Benham's caravan in Hernhill, near Faversham. During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body. The court heard that on the night before Alfie died, Hedges went to buy drugs from their friend and repay her £400 debt, and also get mixers and drinks for their evening together in the caravan. Benham told police he bit Alfie on his back and shook him the morning he found him unresponsive in an attempt to rouse him, the jury heard. The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner. Asked if she had seen Mr Benham murder Alfie, she replied: ""No."" Mark Demain, Alfie's grandfather, said the toddler ""completed our lives"". ""We have never experience pain like this.

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered. Set in mature woodlands, an orchard and rolling fields, it sits behind electric gates and is framed by a stone-walled, Italianate garden. It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing."" Mr Maher also has two sons, aged 32 and 27, and a grandchild, aged two, from his first marriage. He has been working in the IT industry for the past 25 years and his wife Amanda, 54, is a school administrative assistant. He said he was ""overjoyed"" when he learned of his win. ""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires."" Omaze said the draw also raised £3.5m for the RSPCA, the UK's largest and oldest animal welfare charity. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin.

Part of the seven-mile route went past Daisy's school, where the children applauded as Daisy's coffin and the convoy went past. Daisy's mum, Sally Bull, said her daughter ""was something else"".

Daisy came from a family of lorry drivers, and her mum thinks she would have grown up to be a professional lorry driver too. Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December. Nick Bull, Daisy's father, said she ""fought so hard and won the first two battles but wasn't strong enough to win the war"". Daisy's coffin was on the back of a green and white Scania 730, driven by her dad, who runs a haulage company. Daisy's uncle drove the lorry behind, and her cousin drove another lorry.

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered. Set in mature woodlands, an orchard and rolling fields, it sits behind electric gates and is framed by a stone-walled, Italianate garden. It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing.""

""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster. ""We went to the pub to celebrate and then on for a nice curry - it was your average Friday night, really, apart from the fact we'd just become millionaires.""

Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood. Ms James added she had acquired Dugee from someone who bought an emu egg online and hatched it at their home. Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November. Police officers were alerted and helped locate the flightless bird in a residential street close to its home. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

PC Chris Duffy was apprehending Mason Perkins's brother in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March when he was hit by Perkins. The court heard that after the officer fell to the floor, Perkins then also ""pummelled"" his face and body. At Nottingham Crown Court, Perkins was handed an 11-and-a-half year sentence. Warning: A distressing image of PC Duffy's injuries is below PC Duffy, a police dog handler, sustained a ""blow to the head with a relatively heavy object with an edge like a machete, saw or axe"", the court heard on Friday. The officer's injury was described by a forensic pathologist as a ""chop wound"". PC Duffy - who now has a scar from one side of his head to the other - is back on duty. Following an argument at Sunnydale pub, in Mansfield Woodhouse, where Perkins was barred, PC Duffy apprehended Perkins' brother in an alleyway. The court heard Perkins, 25, entered the alleyway and politely asked the officer if he could pass. PC Duffy, believing Perkins was an innocent member of the public, moved to allow him to walk behind. The officer then felt his head being ""violently jolted"" and was thrown to the floor. Perkins next punched and kicked PC Duffy on both sides of the body and face. As the officer got to his feet, Perkins escaped. About 15 minutes later, when PC Duffy was walking back to his car, he spotted Perkins and other officers gave chase and he was arrested. Perkins, of Moor Street, Mansfield, was found with cannabis, scales, and a cannabis grinder on him. Judge Nirmal Shant KC described the officer's injuries as ""grave"". She said: ""You struck the officer when he was not facing you. ""You struck him in a way that jolted him violently on the floor. ""You hit him and punched him and kicked him and bent over him, pummelling him to the side of the face, to the body, then making good your escape."" The judge added the attack had a ""profound effect"" on PC Duffy, saying it had not only left him with physical injuries but psychological injuries too. Perkins had previously admitted grievous bodily harm, supplying cannabis, and offering to supply a Class A drug. Det Sgt Matthew Dumbrell described the attack as ""utterly shocking"" and said the officer was ""fortunate to avoid more serious injuries"". He said: ""I am pleased Perkins will now spend a very considerable length of time in jail, and hope this sentence serves as a warning to others about the consequences of attacking our officers.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-67961443,Post Office inquiry: 'My wife died not knowing who was stealing',A former sub-postmaster has said his wife died not knowing who was stealing money from the Post Office she ran.,2024-01-12,"A former sub-postmaster has said his wife died not knowing who was stealing money from the Post Office she ran. John Heath's wife, Helen, ran a Post Office in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and was one of hundreds of people accused in the Post Office scandal. ""She [Helen] died not knowing whether it was a member of her family that was stealing from her [or] one of her friends who were our employees. ""She had no idea. She carried that to her grave and that is unforgivable."" More than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software, called Horizon, made it look like money was missing from their branches. ""The Post Office destroyed my family,"" said Mr Heath, who lives in Melksham. He explained the software installed in the branch ""would come out with random figures"" when his wife tried to balance the books each Wednesday. When they phoned the helpline they were always told 'you're the only people having this problem'. Mr Heath's daughter, Vikki, said: ""The big tragedy in our family situation is that my mum went to her grave thinking that people were stealing and that is awful. ""That is something that me and my family will have to live with."" Following a campaign by former postmaster Alan Bates - recently dramatised for ITV - Mr Heath realised they were not alone. He said that following his wife's death he was appointed to run the branch without any training. He and his son, who also worked there, had ""exactly the same problems"" as his wife. Ms Heath explained that her father had ""suffered hugely"". ""He has had two strokes since the whole thing started. His mental and physical health has deteriorated hugely,"" she said. Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"". Fujitsu, which developed the software at the heart of the affair, said it was sorry for its role in sub-postmasters' suffering. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Bob Child, 79, who ran a post office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, said he personally repaid £600 when the books would not balance 20 years ago. He remembered getting calls from other sub-postmasters who were worried about the same financial issues. He said at the time he had not made the link to the introduction of Horizon. ""When we did the books with a pen and paper, you'd occasionally be a few pounds over or under, but nothing much,"" he said. ""In about 2002, a few years after Horizon was introduced, we had a shortfall of £600. I couldn't understand and repaid it with my own money."" Mr Child, who is now retired and living in Little Downham near Ely, added: ""At the end of the day, your contract said you had to make good. ""I would say there must be hundreds of people out there who never went to court because they used their own money to make it up."" He said friends who ran other post offices would call him to tell of similar problems. ""When Horizon came in, we used to cash up on a Wednesday,"" said Mr Child. ""Postmasters were ringing me up at eight o'clock on a Wednesday night, saying, 'Bob, I've got a problem. I can't balance my books. I'm £300 in arrears. What am I going to do?'"" More than 900 workers across the country were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches. Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Victims of the Post Office scandal have been promised swift exoneration and compensation by the government. Mr Child told the BBC: ""It was puzzling but at the time, no-one questioned the system. Funnily, it was always a shortfall. I've never heard of anyone being over."" He said he wondered what had happened to the money he repaid. ""My understanding is that it went into a suspended account,"" he said. ""Then after two or three years, it moved into Post Office accounts."" Mr Child said using the Horizon system was often problematic. ""From the time it came in, it was so slow,"" he said. ""It could take hours to cash up - much longer that when we did it on paper."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Healthwatch Suffolk surveyed 13,000 people aged between 11 and 19 - and up to 25 years for those with special educational needs or disabilities. The findings are part of an overall state of young people in the county. Chief executive Andy Yacoub said: ""There needs to be [not only] a whole school approach, but a whole system approach too"". The survey has been conducted for the last eight years alongside other professional groups and student bodies. It found an ""upturn"" in well-being for the first time since the pandemic, but still revealed ""cause for concern"". The survey showed that more than 2,100 young people had seen the ""sharing of images or videos of other students of a sexual nature"". Almost 3,900 had seen or heard people using homophobic language - and 1,768 had seen other ""unwanted sexual behaviour"". Mr Yacoub added: ""Because there are so many respondents, it really is difficult to ignore. ""There is a prevalence of peer on peer sexual harassment, and sexual violence, including online."" Fiona Ellis, the chief executive of Survivors in Transition, who were involved with the survey, said: ""We have seen the numbers of young people needing support around sexual violence, especially peer on peer abuse and harassment increasing year on year at alarming rates. ""Sadly, for many young women in particular, this is becoming a cultural norm, as was reported in Ofsted's 2021 rapid review of sexual abuse in schools. The survey also gauged the state of young people's well-being, including worries regarding the cost of living crisis and optimism for their future. Mr Yacoub said: ""Those who felt as though they had someone to speak to about their well-being at school or college were three times less likely to experience low well-being, which is really positive"".

Newcastle City Council needs to find £15.4m, external worth of cuts for its 2024/2025 budget. One proposed plan is to cut the local authority’s homelessness budget by 50%, which means reducing the number of beds it offers rough sleepers. The council said that no firm decisions around its budget have been made yet. Head of homelessness charity Changing Lives Stephen Bell said: “Why destroy something which doesn’t cost a lot of money?“For me, it’s like 20 years worth of work [that] could be really undone in a matter of months."" The council is proposing to cut the amount it spends on homelessness prevention contracts from £3,289,091 per year to £1,644,546 from October 2024 onwards. A report , externalproduced by the council about the potential impact of such a cut said that a reduction in bed spaces would leave people vulnerable to ""worsened health conditions as more people are faced with rough sleeping"".Over the last year, the number of people rough sleeping in Newcastle has increased from an average of six per night to 14, the report added. A council spokesperson said: “We are in the process of consulting on several budget proposals for 2024/25, one of which relates to a reduction of spend on the services we buy from external providers.“We absolutely understand the potential impact all our proposals have on the people we support.""No decisions have yet been made around access to the services or the numbers of beds available, but we have already spoken with our homeless providers as we want to work with them to safely implement any changes this proposal will have on the way we currently support people who are homeless.""

Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council wants to lower speed limits to cut pollution and improve road safety. Deputy leader Millie Earl said the parties that make up the ruling Three Towns Alliance had campaigned on the 20mph issue ahead of the last election. The Conservative group described the plans as ""anti-car measures"". Responding to a question from cycling campaigner Adam Osman at Tuesday's council meeting, Ms Earl said a default 20mph limit in urban areas ""would be beneficial to walking, wheeling and cycling"" as well as benefiting public health and air quality. She said her ward of Newtown and Heatherlands in Poole had already seen the benefits of 20mph zones. ""I would like to see other communities able to benefit from the safer and healthier environment as we have,"" she said. ""There will be some roads that are exempt on the basis of need and capacity, and it is also likely the roll-out will take some time."" Ms Earl said the council was working with Dorset Police on the plan and was keen to hear the views of the community. She added: ""We have a meeting later this week with the 20's Plenty for Us organisation so we can learn from their experience in other places that have implemented change."" Cabinet is due to discuss the plans in April, after which a public consultation will be held on any proposed changes. Conservative group leader Philip Broadhead described the proposals as ""quite from the blue"" and ""extremely worrying"". He said: ""Many of us warned that voting for these parties would see a return to anti-car measures, and this announcement... shows that we were right."" Mr Osman said reducing the limit was the most ""cost efficient"" way to cut road deaths, reduce car journeys, encourage cycling and improve air quality. In September, Wales became the first UK nation to lower speed limits in residential areas from 30mph (48km/h) to 20mph.

Katie Salt said Oscar disappeared in January 2020 after unexpected heavy snow and did not return home. Despite posters and social media appeals Oscar, 12, could not be found - until a vet called saying he had been living in a garden six miles away. Ms Salt, who had thought the worst, said she was ""so happy"" Oscar was back at home ""where he belongs"". The cat was identified thanks to his microchip after being taken to the vet with an injury. He had been fed and was given an outside shelter but was not checked for a chip, Ms Salt said. As well as social media posts, Ms Salt contacted neighbours who checked their CCTV, outhouses and gardens. She also got in touch with animal rescues, cat shelters and vets. But no one had seen him. Ms Salt said: ""I walked the streets at night for miles and hours shouting his name, rattling his food, for weeks on end. All to no avail. ""We eventually concluded he must have died during the snowstorm, but we still scanned our eyes everywhere, whenever we were out driving, and to be honest this never stopped, even after two years."" Ms Salt said Oscar's temporary carers had taken him to a vet when he needed medical care. She continued: ""The vet, after hearing their story, checked him for a chip and low and behold it was our Oscar!"" Oscar, who needed surgery, remembered her and now ""cannot stop purring"" at home, she said. Ms Salt urged other pet owners to make sure their animals' microchips were up to date and to get them a collar with a tag stating they had one. Bill Lambert, spokesperson for Petlog, the firm Oscar is chipped with, said: ""Their story shows just how important it is for owners to chip their pets, keep their contact details up to date with their microchip database, and to hold out hope no matter how much time has passed. ""Cat owners should also be aware that the government have announced microchipping will become a legal requirement for cats in England from June 2024."" A microchip is the size of a grain of rice which is inserted under the skin at the back of an animal's neck. It permanently identifies pets and connects them with an owner's contact details, which are held on a database. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Norfolk County Council runs the system in the county, which tells passengers when the buses are expected. Issues with the global positioning system connections (GPS) meant information could disappear from the screens. The council said it was aware of the issues and was working with all bus operators to improve the system. Any significant delays and cancellations cannot currently be sent to the boards by the bus operators. Barry Waterson, 63, is a supermarket delivery driver and relies on the bus to get to work from his home in Thorpe St Andrew on the outskirts of Norwich. He said: ""When the bus disappears from the screen, you get this sinking feeling and think 'oh no, not again'. ""It's really annoying [and] frustrating. You're tired. You want to get home and you've got to wait for another half an hour, three quarters of an hour, sometimes an hour for another one."" Karen Smith, 63, lives in Lingwood, which is served with an hourly bus to Norwich. ""Very often I can be standing here and your bus will just disappear,"" she said. ""You have no knowledge of whether it's broken down, whether it's going to be late, whether it's been held up in traffic: you don't know whether it's coming or not."" Kyle Thompson, 20, from Spixworth, said: ""Sometimes you have a bus [due] in, say ten minutes, and as soon as it hits that time it completely goes off the screen and there is no sign whatsoever of where it's gone or even if it's on the app or anything."" Julie Roberts, 59, from Hellesdon, said: ""It's very frustrating, especially when it's cold and you're just standing at the bus stop."" Piers Marlow, managing director of First East of England, said: ""We are aware of the issue of buses dropping off information boards at bus stops, and we apologise to those who are affected by it. ""This is an issue that affects bus operators across the East of England, and in many other areas of the UK.""

The application has been sent to the borough council which will now consider the proposals.

Family housing and the provision of 30% affordable housing are also being promised 'to meet the need for affordable housing,' according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Access to the main estate would be north just of the junction of Tadpole Lane and Groves Cottages where the main road makes a sharp left turn. If approved, the junction with Tadpole Lane will be reconfigured with the main carriageway running into the new development, and a junction controlling traffic continuing west on Tadpole Lane. The application added: ""The proposals would bring significant benefits to transport and public safety through the reconfiguration of Tadpole Lane to remove the tight blind bend at Grove Cottages and the delivery of new bus stops on Tadpole Lane.""

The 150-million-year-old marine reptile went on display last week, close to where the beast was found on a beach near Kimmeridge Bay. The rest of its skeleton may still be entombed in the crumbling cliffs, and the hope is it may eventually be recovered. The museum's operations manager Carla Crook, daughter of palaeontologist Steve Etches who led the excavation, said their total number of visitors for the whole month of January is ""usually only about 500"". Its busiest day ever, on Saturday 6 January, saw a total number of 1,064 visitors. ""The majority are local, but there are lots of people who are coming from much further afield,"" Mrs Crook said. ""We've had people come down from Wales... We have had some people visit from Australia. ""These are people that have come over from abroad and because they've heard about the skull they've tied us into their visit."" She said the museum has had enquiries from people in the United States, Australia, and Europe, and that they do not think interest in the skull has hit its ""potential peak yet"". ""[The documentary] is still to go out on PBS on the 14 February to the United States, so we're still awaiting the wash of potential interest of visitors that that screening is going to create,"" she said. ""It's given us that lifeline in visitors that we so desperately need to keep us going. ""I think Kimmeridge will become busier because they'll want to come down and actually, not just take in the geology of the bay, but try to look for fossils themselves."" But if people wish to fossil-hunt, Mrs Crook said it was really important they follow the fossil collecting code, the rules and regulations of the bay, and health and safety precautions. She said: ""Loose fossils along the whole of the Jurassic coast are okay to pick up, but Steve is the only one that has access to actually collect from Kimmeridge bay. ""What they can't do is use hammers to hammer anything out of the shell ledges or the cliffs.""

Morgan MacRae, 22, from Peppard, Oxfordshire, was unresponsive for 17 minutes after suffering an arrest in bed in August. His girlfriend Kitty Williams, 22, performed CPR, which she had learned at university, until paramedics arrived. He said extending CPR training would ""make the world a safer place"". Mr MacRae, a hooker with Henley Hawks in the fourth tier of English rugby, was in bed at his brothers' house in London early on 11 August when Ms Williams noticed he was not breathing. ""He was gasping for air - I was shaking him quite vigorously,"" she said. ""His head rolled back and he literally went blue. His eyes went back - he was completely unconscious. ""It was terrifying - I called 999 and started performing CPR."" Ms Williams had been taught CPR while playing lacrosse at Oxford Brookes University. She said: ""Thank goodness I did know. I was confidently able to perform CPR on Morgan and know it was correct and helping him. ""You go into crisis mode - it's down to me now. I just kept going and kept going."" She performed CPR for about eight minutes, supported by the 999 operator, until paramedics arrived and eventually resuscitated Mr MacRae, after shocking him four times with a defibrillator. After tests in hospital, the cardiac arrest was put down to an ectopic heartbeat sending his heart into a ""frenzy"". He was fitted with an S-ICD defibrillator implant. The couple said their experience showed that ""every minute counts"" and have pledged to promote CPR training as widely as possible, starting with local schools. Mr MacRae said: ""Being the recipient of CPR, I asked friends and family 'would you know what to do?' and the general consensus was 'no, not really'. ""It was an early goal, to get as many people trained up with CPR as possible to make the world a safer place."" Mr MacRae, who won Henley's Young Player of the Year award in May, said he had already resumed rugby training and hoped to get back to full-contact play. ""There was no evidence exercise was something that caused this - if it had been on the pitch it would be a different story,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be playing a sport like rugby if I was nervous of lots of things. I've got to trust the experts and go with it.""

Household waste recycling centres in Alresford, Bishop's Waltham, Fair Oak, Hartley Wintney and Hayling Island were found to be the most expensive to run by Hampshire County Council. Sites in Aldershot, Bordon, Casbrook, Hedge End, Marchwood, Petersfield and Somerley are also at risk. The authority said the closures would save £1.6 million per year. The changes were revealed under a cost-cutting plan to meet the council's predicted £132 million budget shortfall by April 2025. Operational challenges, poor performance and investment requirements were also reasons given for shutting down the 12 sites. Under the plans, the opening times and types of waste accepted could also change at some tips. Staff employed by Veolia, which manages the sites, could face job losses as a result. Hampshire County Council said it had considered reducing the opening hours of tips, with an estimated saving of £1.2 million per year, but said that would result in each site across the county closing for three days per week. It was also contemplating bringing in new fees, such as ""premium booking slots"". Conservative-run Hampshire County Council previously said it was under ""immense pressure"" to balance its budget.

The Bishopstoke Road bus improvement scheme would have seen a bus lane built between the Riverside and Chickenhall junctions in Eastleigh, Hampshire. Funding for the project from the government's Transforming Cities programme was welcomed by Hampshire County Council in 2020. But the authority said the plan was shelved due to ""deliverability"" issues. It will instead be replaced by a ""better value for money"" bus corridor to Fair Oak. The scheme was part of a wider plan to improve the public transport corridors between Southampton, Eastleigh, Bursledon and Totton. In March 2020, the Department for Transport (DfT) awarded £57m to the Southampton City region to encourage sustainable travel from outlying residential areas. The plan for Bishopstoke Road also included better bus stops with screens that gave real-time timetable updates, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The scheme will now be refinanced and delivered to a new timeline, subject to approval from the DfT.In the authority's updated report, it said it now proposed to ""implement improvements along the Blue Star 2 bus corridor for the value of £530,000"".

Ashley Hall, 36, from Witney, Oxfordshire, suffers from Type 1 Diabetes and was recently diagnosed with bile acid malabsorption. It causes severe diarrhoea and prevents the body from absorbing nutrients, leaving him fatigued and in pain. Mr Hall was signed off work last May but was turned down for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) in August. His mandatory reconsideration [challenge to the benefits decision] was refused two months later. He now faces a seven-month wait for a tribunal in order to appeal the decision by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The government said it has made millions of PIP decisions and 3% have been overturned. ""It's got massive impacts, I constantly need to go to the toilet,"" Mr Hall said. ""I'm constantly in pain and tired all the time because I get about two hours sleep a night with it. ""I can spend six hours a day on the toilet. I wouldn't employ me on that and the doctors have said I'm not able to work."" He said that because his body cannot absorb nutrients his sugar levels are ""so up and down and sporadic that I'm not able to commit myself to a job"". The father-of-three gave up his maintenance job at a water company two years ago when he started suffering from ongoing bouts of stomach pain. He then took on a job as a delivery driver, which offered more routine shifts and shorter working hours but, when the pain started to get worse, he was signed off by his GP in May 2023. He was diagnosed with Bile Acid Malabsorption on 1 December. His wife is a full-time carer to one of their children who also suffers from Type 1 Diabetes and the couple receive universal credit, which Mr Hall says covers the rent and bills but leaves little else for family life. ""I've always been strong mentally but this is grinding me down now,"" he said, adding: ""We don't get to go out and do things as a family, it's horrible."" PIPs are awarded based on how conditions affect the claimant and are meant to cover the additional living costs incurred as a result. In total, 3.2 million adults in England and Wales now receive PIP to help with the extra cost of living with a health condition or disability. The number has increased by about one million over the last decade and is forecast by the DWP to rise by another million over the next three years. According to DWP, in the five years to June 2023, 2.9 million initial decisions following a PIP assessment were made and, by October 2023, 8% were appealed and 3% were overturned at tribunal. Mr Hall said he found the assessment process for PIP stressful and that DWP's questions made him feel ""worthless"". The DWP said: ""We support millions of people every year and our priority is they receive a supportive service and get the benefits they are entitled to as soon as possible. ""Our disability assessors are qualified health professionals and decisions are made using all the available information.

Alfie Phillips died on 28 November 2020 with more than 70 visible wounds and traces of cocaine in his body. Sian Hedges, 27, and Jack Benham, 35, had denied murdering the toddler. At Maidstone Crown Court, Hedges was sentenced to a minimum term of 19 years, while Benham was handed a minimum term of 23 years. Justice Cavanagh said in his sentencing remarks that Alfie had been the victim of a ""frenzied attack"" in which he suffered about 50 injuries on the night of his death. He said to Hedges: ""You were Alfie's mother and he deserved your protection."" Sam Phillips, Alfie's father, described him as ""good as gold"" and ""lively"", adding he had been ""robbed of the opportunity to see him grown up"". ""The funeral was one of the hardest days of my lives. The images of his tiny coffin will stay with me forever,"" he said. Hedges, of Yelverton, Devon, and Benham, killed Alfie overnight during lockdown in Benham's caravan in Hernhill, near Faversham. During the nine-week trial, which ended on 30 November 2023, the prosecution said both defendants were complicit in the assaults that took place. Alfie died with injuries including fractures to his ribs, arms and leg, signs of smothering to his lips and mouth, and traces of cocaine in his body. The court heard that on the night before Alfie died, Hedges went to buy drugs from their friend and repay her £400 debt, and also get mixers and drinks for their evening together in the caravan. Benham told police he bit Alfie on his back and shook him the morning he found him unresponsive in an attempt to rouse him, the jury heard. The pair met in September 2020 at a mutual friend's house, where they would buy drugs. During the trial, Hedges told her barrister that when she heard Alfie had died ""I rang my mum and was screaming down the phone to her that Jack had murdered my son"". She said she had not beaten Alfie deliberately, had not seen Mr Benham do so and would not have covered for her former partner. Asked if she had seen Mr Benham murder Alfie, she replied: ""No."" Mark Demain, Alfie's grandfather, said the toddler ""completed our lives"". ""We have never experience pain like this. I would describe it as if the light in our souls have gone out,"" he said. ""Our best friend, our grandson was so cruelly taken from us. Every day we are hurting."" Jurors previously heard about older injuries Alfie sustained in the months prior to his death and their explanations for them, such as a cut under his eye from playing with keys and his fingers being caught in the dog gate in Benham's parents' home. One incident was described in which Hedges described finding blood on the carpet, a cushion and a tissue, but was told Alfie had fallen and hit his mouth on the oil heater. Benham had described how he held Alfie above him but he slipped out of his hands and hit his nose on Benham's teeth, the court heard. Ms Hedges said she was not there and was unaware it had happened. When the pair were found guilty, Det Ch Insp Kathleen Way, of Kent Police, said the verdict would ""not bring Alfie back"", but would mean that ""Hedges and Benham lose their right to freedom and life as they know it"". ""Alfie should have been protected and loved by his mum, instead Hedges and Benham inflicted unimaginable suffering on him during a sustained and lengthy night of violence,"" she added. Following the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Way said Hedges and Benham inflicted ""unimaginable suffering"".

Daisy Bull died in December after being diagnosed with cancer in her kidney three years ago. Hundreds of people stood by the side of roads in Retford in Nottinghamshire to pay their respects to Daisy. Part of the seven-mile route went past Daisy's school, where the children applauded as Daisy's coffin and the convoy went past. Daisy's mum, Sally Bull, said her daughter ""was something else"". ""She was a little bit different from your average 12-year-old,"" Mrs Bull said. ""She loved lorries and went everywhere with her dad in his lorry."" Daisy came from a family of lorry drivers, and her mum thinks she would have grown up to be a professional lorry driver too. Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December. Nick Bull, Daisy's father, said she ""fought so hard and won the first two battles but wasn't strong enough to win the war"". Daisy's coffin was on the back of a green and white Scania 730, driven by her dad, who runs a haulage company. Daisy's uncle drove the lorry behind, and her cousin drove another lorry. Mrs Bull said the funeral convoy was ""very different but very nice"". ""We are a massive lorry family with crazy lorry friends,"" she said. ""We asked if anyone would like to join us and it's escalated and escalated."" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences.""

Michael Maher, 53, originally from Essex, won the keys to the ""stunning"" six-bedroom home in Somerset after paying £10 to enter the draw. He, his wife and their two children have been living in a rented four-bedroom home on the outskirts of Luton. They celebrated their win by going to the pub and then for a ""nice curry"". Their new home, eight miles (13km) from Bath, comes with six bedrooms and is mortgage-free with all stamp duty and legal fees covered. Set in mature woodlands, an orchard and rolling fields, it sits behind electric gates and is framed by a stone-walled, Italianate garden. It also has a tennis court, an orangery and an oak-framed triple garage and workshops. Draw organisers Omaze said Mr Maher could live in the home, sell it or even rent it out for between £6,000 and £8,000 a month. However, Mr Maher said: ""My son and daughter asked us if they can quit their Saturday jobs now that we own a mansion - we said absolutely not. ""We want them to stay grounded. Going from a rented house in Luton to owning a six-bedroom house in the countryside is just mind-blowing."" Mr Maher also has two sons, aged 32 and 27, and a grandchild, aged two, from his first marriage. He has been working in the IT industry for the past 25 years and his wife Amanda, 54, is a school administrative assistant. He said he was ""overjoyed"" when he learned of his win. ""I had a call from Omaze saying I'd won a prize - obviously I was intrigued but my daughter was somewhat sceptical and told me not to get too excited as I've probably only won a toaster,"" he said, ""Luckily for me it turned out to be a £3m house - that also happens to come with a toaster.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-67958022,Former Lancashire policeman jailed over 'jealous rage' attack,"A police officer who brutally attacked his ex-girlfriend in a ""jealous rage"" has been jailed.",2024-01-12,"A police officer who brutally attacked his ex-girlfriend in a ""jealous rage"" has been jailed. James Riley strangled PhD student Ellie Moxham and left her unconscious on a hotel room floor after he learned she was planning to start a new relationship, a court heard. The 28-year-old from Preston, who was off duty at the time, admitted attempted murder at an earlier hearing. He was jailed for 16 years at Manchester Crown Court. Riley, who was off-duty at the time of the incident in 2022, was dismissed by his employers, Lancashire Constabulary, last year. The court heard how he had been in a relationship with Miss Moxham for several years and they bought a house together in 2021, but their relationship was effectively at an end. On 10 November 2022 the pair had planned to attend a concert together and Miss Moxham had been persuaded to stay at a hotel in Manchester city centre which Riley saw as ""as a hope for reconciliation"", the court was told. It was a decision Judge Patrick Field KC said he was sure ""she will forever regret"". On sentencing, Judge Field told Riley his relationship with Miss Moxham ""had become an unhappy one, characterised by jealousy and possessive behaviour on your part"". He said when it became clear Miss Moxham was intent on forming a new relationship with another man Riley had become ""consumed by uncontrollable anger and a jealous rage"" and had attacked her ""with murderous intent"". He said Miss Moxham had no memory of the assault, but it was ""clear"" that Riley ""gripped her throat and strangled her with such force over a significant period that her brain was starved of oxygen"". This caused her to lose consciousness, he said, and to suffer profound injuries which has led to continuing cognitive difficulties. The judge continued: ""To your discredit, once you realised Miss Moxham was indeed very seriously injured and in need of expert medical assistance, your first reaction seems to have been to call your parents to speak to them for about 11 minutes before, almost as an afterthought, calling for an ambulance. ""You also abandoned Miss Moxham at the scene in an effort to save your own skin. ""While I accept this was not a pre-meditated attack and you acted spontaneously, this was nevertheless a brutal and determined attempt to kill your former partner."" Police were able to track Riley's movements on CCTV and he was later arrested in West Yorkshire. In a statement after the sentencing, Det Sgt Heidi Cullum, of Greater Manchester Police, commended the bravery of the Miss Moxham and said: ""What happened to her on that night, by someone she should have been able to trust, is unthinkable. ""We hope now she can move on with the rest of her life safe in the knowledge that he cannot commit this act of violence to anyone else whilst behind bars. ""As police officers the public rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity. As a profession we are all hurt by Riley's actions, which can never be justified, and we are pleased he will now face the consequences."" Det Supt Zoe Mainey, of Lancashire Police, said the force ""utterly condemned"" Riley's actions and officers' thoughts were with the victim and those affected ""by this extremely serious and concerning crime"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-67963420,Kent charity fined over escape of 'ladies' man' emu,"An animal charity has been given a £100 fine after a ""ladies' man"" emu escaped.",2024-01-12,"An animal charity has been given a £100 fine after a ""ladies' man"" emu escaped. Dugee broke out of The Happy Pants Ranch in Bobbing, Kent, on 4 January, prompting a fine from Swale Borough Council for failure to comply with a community protection notice. The bird was on the run for 30 minutes but only made it as far as the field ""over the road"" from the charity. Founder Amey James said of the timing: ""It was typical I was just grabbing a curry with my my mum in Wetherspoons."" While it was not the first time Dugee had escaped, she said the community had not been in danger, explaining: ""He is so tame and he likes people so much. He could have wandered miles and miles and miles if he wanted to."" Swale Borough Council has been contacted for comment. Spirited emus loom large in the British psyche following 1970s TV mayhem in which a dangly-legged, azure-hued puppet got the better of interviewer Michael Parkinson. As for the curry, Ms James explained: ""I left [it] where it was and drove back."" When she arrived at the scene, Ms James said Dugee - whom she described as a ""ladies' man"" - simply followed her back to the sanctuary on Iwade Road. Wind had blown down fence panels in an open-air enclosure there, meaning the bird ""took his opportunity"" to tour the neighbourhood.

Another escaped emu, named Rodney, was spotted on doorbell footage at a property in Loose, Kent, in November.

PC Chris Duffy was apprehending Mason Perkins's brother in Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March when he was hit by Perkins. The court heard that after the officer fell to the floor, Perkins then also ""pummelled"" his face and body. At Nottingham Crown Court, Perkins was handed an 11-and-a-half year sentence. Warning: A distressing image of PC Duffy's injuries is below PC Duffy, a police dog handler, sustained a ""blow to the head with a relatively heavy object with an edge like a machete, saw or axe"", the court heard on Friday. The officer's injury was described by a forensic pathologist as a ""chop wound"". PC Duffy - who now has a scar from one side of his head to the other - is back on duty. Following an argument at Sunnydale pub, in Mansfield Woodhouse, where Perkins was barred, PC Duffy apprehended Perkins' brother in an alleyway. The court heard Perkins, 25, entered the alleyway and politely asked the officer if he could pass. PC Duffy, believing Perkins was an innocent member of the public, moved to allow him to walk behind. The officer then felt his head being ""violently jolted"" and was thrown to the floor. Perkins next punched and kicked PC Duffy on both sides of the body and face. As the officer got to his feet, Perkins escaped. About 15 minutes later, when PC Duffy was walking back to his car, he spotted Perkins and other officers gave chase and he was arrested. Perkins, of Moor Street, Mansfield, was found with cannabis, scales, and a cannabis grinder on him. Judge Nirmal Shant KC described the officer's injuries as ""grave"". She said: ""You struck the officer when he was not facing you. ""You struck him in a way that jolted him violently on the floor. ""You hit him and punched him and kicked him and bent over him, pummelling him to the side of the face, to the body, then making good your escape."" The judge added the attack had a ""profound effect"" on PC Duffy, saying it had not only left him with physical injuries but psychological injuries too. Perkins had previously admitted grievous bodily harm, supplying cannabis, and offering to supply a Class A drug. Det Sgt Matthew Dumbrell described the attack as ""utterly shocking"" and said the officer was ""fortunate to avoid more serious injuries"". He said: ""I am pleased Perkins will now spend a very considerable length of time in jail, and hope this sentence serves as a warning to others about the consequences of attacking our officers. ""I would also like to place on record my admiration for the officer involved, who in the moments before, during, and after this attack demonstrated so many of the qualities we expect from front-line police officers.""

John Heath's wife, Helen, ran a Post Office in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, and was one of hundreds of people accused in the Post Office scandal. ""She [Helen] died not knowing whether it was a member of her family that was stealing from her [or] one of her friends who were our employees. ""She had no idea. She carried that to her grave and that is unforgivable."" More than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software, called Horizon, made it look like money was missing from their branches. ""The Post Office destroyed my family,"" said Mr Heath, who lives in Melksham. He explained the software installed in the branch ""would come out with random figures"" when his wife tried to balance the books each Wednesday. When they phoned the helpline they were always told 'you're the only people having this problem'. Mr Heath's daughter, Vikki, said: ""The big tragedy in our family situation is that my mum went to her grave thinking that people were stealing and that is awful. ""That is something that me and my family will have to live with."" Following a campaign by former postmaster Alan Bates - recently dramatised for ITV - Mr Heath realised they were not alone. He said that following his wife's death he was appointed to run the branch without any training. He and his son, who also worked there, had ""exactly the same problems"" as his wife. Ms Heath explained that her father had ""suffered hugely"". ""He has had two strokes since the whole thing started. His mental and physical health has deteriorated hugely,"" she said. Ms Heath said he was ""very unrecognisable compared to who he was. Completely obliterated of body and soul."" Mr Heath said he eventually arranged for an audit to come in and check the branch. ""That's when we saw the true nature of the Post Office,"" he said. ""They were absolutely awful, pushing their weight [around]. They came in like a bunch of stormtroopers."" At the end of the audit, they asked for the keys to the premises and Mr Heath refused to hand them over. In the October they terminated him from the job. ""By December I'd had a full stroke and then three months after that I had a minor stroke,"" he said. Earlier this week, former Post Office boss Paula Vennells announced she was handing back her CBE after facing mounting pressure over the scandal. But Mr Heath said: ""She should be leading a stampede of senior people into jail."" Mrs Heath's life insurance payout helped to make up some of the missing money and Mr Heath was not prosecuted. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. ""I don't call it compensation, I call it recovery of money stolen. I want that paid as quickly as they possibly can,"" said Mr Heath. ""They took my health, my family and my sense of wellbeing. They've taken everything, literally. Brought me to my knees."" Ms Heath said now seeing all the support the victims are receiving would make her mum ""incredibly happy"". A spokesperson for the Post Office said they are ""doing all we can to right the wrongs of the past"".

When she was first questioned, Mrs Oluwa said her daughter was with her, but inquiries revealed she was at school. She then told the council she had used the Blue Badge as she had no money to pay for parking.A council spokesperson said: ""By misusing the Blue Badge on this occasion, to avoid paying for £2 parking, Mrs Oluwa now has a criminal record and has been ordered to pay £979.""

Bob Child, 79, who ran a post office in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, said he personally repaid £600 when the books would not balance 20 years ago. He remembered getting calls from other sub-postmasters who were worried about the same financial issues. He said at the time he had not made the link to the introduction of Horizon. ""When we did the books with a pen and paper, you'd occasionally be a few pounds over or under, but nothing much,"" he said. ""In about 2002, a few years after Horizon was introduced, we had a shortfall of £600. I couldn't understand and repaid it with my own money."" Mr Child, who is now retired and living in Little Downham near Ely, added: ""At the end of the day, your contract said you had to make good. ""I would say there must be hundreds of people out there who never went to court because they used their own money to make it up."" He said friends who ran other post offices would call him to tell of similar problems. ""When Horizon came in, we used to cash up on a Wednesday,"" said Mr Child.

Mr Child told the BBC: ""It was puzzling but at the time, no-one questioned the system. Funnily, it was always a shortfall. I've never heard of anyone being over."" He said he wondered what had happened to the money he repaid. ""My understanding is that it went into a suspended account,"" he said. ""Then after two or three years, it moved into Post Office accounts."" Mr Child said using the Horizon system was often problematic. ""From the time it came in, it was so slow,"" he said.

Research published by Prof Robin Bryant found an increase in the defacement of churches, castles and monasteries in an area of Kent. Mr Bryant, from Canterbury Christ Church University, believes AI could be used to ""link offences together"". It is hoped the technology could identify offenders by tracking tags and matching graffiti in other areas. The new research, funded by Historic England, and published by Mr Bryant, who is director of criminal justice practice at Canterbury Christ Church University, analysed crimes recorded over a four year period across Kent and Medway. It found 8% of all recorded crime and anti-social behaviour occurs within, at, or close to, a protected heritage site. Mr Bryant said: ""Our best estimates suggest that currently approximately one in five listed buildings and one in four places of worship in Kent and Medway experience some form of crime each year. ""AI offers the possibility to link offences together to the same offenders. In classic policing terms, this is normally a very good start in terms of an investigation.""

Cornwall Council said it was seeking to remove ""live-aboard"" vessel Karina Olsen from Penzance Harbour. It said the vessel was among a number of abandoned boats which need to be sold or demolished in Cornish ports. Maritime manager Chris Jones disputed one councillor's claim they were ""powerless"" to pursue boat owners. Councillor Peter Channon had said: ""When's it all going to end? Owners are escaping from this because we're not pursuing them."" Mr Jones disagreed: ""We are pursuing heavily the owner of the vessel and we're taking legal advice."" But the meeting heard council removing or scrapping of large boats can cost up to £70,000, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Karina Olsen was among a number of boats discussed at a meeting of Cornwall Harbours Board. Attendees heard the vessel was sold by its original owner on the condition it be removed from the harbour within three months as it was ""taking up valuable berth space"". But the boat was resold without agreement with Penzance harbour master, the meeting heard, while the new owner ""was not communicating with authorities"". Four years out of service, the boat had ""rotten planks and the presence of destructive gribble worm"", the meeting heard, and posed ""a risk to harbour safety"". A council report said the harbour master had made ""continuous attempts"" - including six emails - to make contact with the owner ""to no avail"". The council had to ""commence the process to take possession of the vessel"". The owner, who the councils said owed the harbour £3,800, failed to meet a 8 December deadline to make contact, it added. In order to reduce the risk of the boat sinking, Cornwall Harbours Board has the powers to sell, remove or scrap it, which can cost up to £70,000. Mr Jones said there were two other boats in Cornish harbours that would be costly to dispose of, including an ex-fishing boat in Penryn which had been there ""for many, many years"". He said there were smaller boats that would cost between £1,500 and £2,000 to remove. Mr Jones said lobbying continued for a registration scheme but that owners would ultimately have to pay for disposal. He added: ""These are all legacy issues: they're not boats that have arrived on our watch. ""We are now really strict with any boat that comes in. If it highlights as a risk to us we're making the harbours not so welcoming to such vessels. ""We're also enforcing our by-laws, terms and conditions, and mooring licences.""

Following an inquest, his parents understand he was killed by two gunshots at close range, to the head and torso, and not by tank fire as was initially suspected. Both Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw were helping to evacuate a woman from an area of heavy bombardment in eastern Ukraine when they were killed. Mrs Parry said: ""We don't know who did it, when they did it or even why they did it. ""The best we can hope for is that they recognise it as an unlawful killing.

""If we're serious, and not sitting here in 2029 wringing our hands and saying we didn't do it, then we need a clear action plan."" Cllr Martin Pearce said: ""We've got a track record that says we can set ambitious targets and we can deliver."" The committee heard that government and private investment would be needed if Exeter was to meet its 2030 target which is 20 years ahead of the government's stated target of 2050. The report to the committee continued: ""The city council cannot achieve city-wide net zero alone. ""There will be the absolute need and requirement to engage and work collaboratively with a wide range of city partners, most notably Devon County Council."" City council leader Phil Bialyk added: ""There is a lot of work to do. We cannot be complacent."" Follow BBC News South West on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

""From the Caribbean to Coventry: Plotting the Rise of 2 Tone"" features an array of band memorabilia and photos. The music scene was born in the late 1970s and 1980s with Coventry bands such as The Selecter and The Specials playing a central part in its growth. The exhibition starts on Friday at the Barbican Library, London. The exhibition was designed to highlight the positive influences on British youth culture which Caribbean immigration has brought and continues to bring to the UK, organisers said. The show, which will run until 25 May, will also include architecture, art and literature and direct contributions from fans. The genre was named after the 2-Tone record label founded by Jerry Dammers of The Specials who had a vision of a ""Coventry Motown"" by creating a production line of records with bands like Madness and The Beat. An upcoming BBC series created by Peaky Blinders writer Steven Knight will also pay homage to the music scene. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-67945251,Historian asks for help identifying WW1 soldiers in historic photo,"An amateur historian is asking for help identifying soldiers in a photograph from World War One, unearthed 40 years ago in a private collection.",2024-01-12,"An amateur historian is asking for help identifying soldiers in a photograph from World War One, unearthed 40 years ago in a private collection. The picture shows soldiers from D Company, 1/4th Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment who fought during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. ""They're all local men from the Bristol area,"" said Ian Chard, from Fishponds, who is a relative of one of the men. ""To know who they were would be tremendous,"" he said. Mr Chard is distantly related by marriage to Sgt Bill Taylor, who married one of his great grandmother's children. He is keen to put more names to the faces in the picture. ""This photo came into my possession about 40 years ago and with the recent World War One memorials I decided to get it out and have a proper look."" Bill Taylor became the company sergeant major as the war progressed and was awarded the military medal. He married after the war and lived with his family in Easton, Bristol. Mr Chard is hoping people will come forward who may recognise someone: grandfathers, great grandfathers or great uncles, and give him some history about who the soldiers were and what happened to them. ""It was a typical territorial battalion and they would all have been Bristol men, or thereabouts. The names we have, we know they were born in Temple Meads, Westbury, Brislington, Old Sodbury: those sorts of places, so they're all local men,"" said Mr Chard. Len Evans, director and trustee of the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum, said it was poignant to look at the photograph. ""There's a group of individuals who have served their county, their country, in the Great War and sadly so many of them would have been casualties during that period. Some died and some were seriously hurt. ""It's sad in some ways, but joyous in others because it's a testament to their determination to get the job done. ""I don't think we'll get all the names, because one of the problems we have is that lots and lots of families will come and bring in photos, literature and all sorts of memorabilia from the First World War but very rarely do photos have any attached names."" Mr Chard believes names would bring the photograph to life. ""There are children of these people still alive, in the faces we see around us. People we may have known,"" he said. Some individuals in the photograph have already been identified. Second row down, third from left is 200918 Private Edwin Vickerage, who survived to be 100 years old. 200542 Private Harold Beck, the Lewis gunner, is lying down with his legs under the machine gun. ""There's a fellow right in the middle behind the machine gun. He's obviously of African heritage,"" pointed out Mr Chard. ""One must assume he's a Bristolian. ""He's just gone through the hell of the fighting alongside his comrades and is standing there as an equal: something we generally don't expect to find in a territorial battalion of the First World War. It would be lovely to know who he was."" The 1916 date on the plaque in the photo places it firmly during the Battle of the Somme. During the long campaign, more than 250,000 men were killed on the British side alone. The D Company, 1/4th Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, participated in the assault on the French village of Ovillers between 15 and 18 July. Only 77 soldiers out of about 200 were still alive when the battalion withdrew from the front line to a nearby village after severe fighting and they were pictured in a moment in time, showing off the German trophies they came by after the skirmish. ""As you can see in the photograph, there is actually a Maxim machine gun. Others have got swords, and even helmets they acquired from German officers. Some would have been brought home and many would actually have been traded by the soldiers. ""They're just having fun after a very difficult time,"" said Mr Evans. ""It's a snapshot of these fellows after the horror of what they've just gone through,"" added Mr Chard. The Gloucestershire Regiment, commonly referred to as the Glosters, was a line infantry regiment of the British Army from 1881 until 1994. At its formation the regiment comprised two regular, two militia and two volunteer battalions, and saw its first action during the Second Boer War. Sixteen battalions of the regiment saw active service in during World War One, losing a total of 8,100 men. Shortly after celebrating its tercentenary in 1994, the regiment was merged with the former Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment to form the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment, which then also merged in 2007 to become The Rifles. ""It's vital to remember the sacrifices they made,"" said Mr Chard. ""It would add a great deal to the understanding of the battalion and how the Territorial Army worked at the time,"" he concluded.

Karis Theophane, the founder of Jerk Grill, started her venture in 2018 and has kept growing, despite the pandemic and her food truck being stolen. Jerk Grill was among almost 1,000 other businesses to apply for the fund which supports black business owners. Ms Theophane said the eatery was a ""community anchor"". ""We have definitely outgrown Mum's kitchen,"" she said. ""We are [...] providing jobs for disadvantaged people and a place for people from all walks of life to gather."" Ms Theophane said she had been operating out of a cafe in Pembury Community Centre in Hackney and had been providing employment for disadvantaged members of the local community. She plans to open a dedicated jerk chicken restaurant in Clapton later this month. ""Providing a space like this can be an inspiration to the local community,"" she said. ""Empowering people to build an equitable future, be more confident and have a positive impact in society."" Alongside the £10,000 grant, Ms Theophane has invested family savings into the new location. She added: ""Our new forever home also enables us to create five new jobs immediately as we continue to grow."" The business, she said, will continue in its ""social mission"" of reducing food poverty and social isolation. The Black Business Fund, set up by Uber Eats and run by Enterprise Nation, sees £250,000 distributed to 25 small black-owned businesses across the country. According to government data about 6% of small and medium enterprises (SME) are ethnic-minority-led. Lorraine Copes, founder of Be Inclusive hospitality and judge for the 2024 fund, said: ""It fills me with optimism for the future of hospitality as I discover the diverse array of founders who entered the industry out of a genuine love for hospitality and food. ""Unfortunately, uncertainty appears to be following us into 2024, and I am pleased that this fund will offer a much-needed boost for black entrepreneurs.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67940107,Almost half of family courts to allow reporting in England and Wales,A pilot scheme to allow journalists and legal bloggers to report cases from three family courts in England and Wales is to be extended to almost half of the courts in the countries.,2024-01-12,"A pilot scheme to allow journalists and legal bloggers to report cases from three family courts in England and Wales is to be extended to almost half of the courts in the countries. From 29 January, coverage of cases at 16 more family court centres in England will be permitted. This means 19 of the 43 centres in England and Wales will be part of the Transparency Pilot. Families and individual social workers will be anonymous under the scheme. However, reporting can include the names of local authorities and some experts, once Transparency Orders are granted. For the first time in these courts, reporters will be able to speak to families about their cases, quote from documents and describe what they see and hear in court. Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the High Court's Family Division, described the move as a ""huge step to increase transparency and improve public confidence and understanding of the family justice system"". He urged the media to come to the family courts, to see the ""vital and challenging work"" that is done there. Journalists and legal bloggers will be able to apply for Transparency Orders in Liverpool, Manchester, West Yorkshire, Hull, the Midlands, Dorset, Truro, Luton, Guildford and Milton Keynes, as well as in all of London's family courts. Initially, reporting will be limited to ""public law cases"", where judges are deciding whether children should be taken into care. As happened in the pilot centres of Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle, reporting will be extended  later to ""private law cases"", where parents are separating. It will also be allowed eventually at magistrates' hearings of family cases. During the past year, the BBC has reported extensively from the pilot courts, including a series of in-depth pieces on individual stories on Radio 4's Today programme. Another piece, by BBC Look North, focused on an abuse survivor's legal fight to get her children back. Our report on a mother trying to remove parental rights from her child's paedophile father led to calls to change the law. Cathy Ashley, of the Family Rights Group, which supports many families in these cases, said she ""warmly welcomed"" the extension. She said it would help parents understand the system, and provide a ""mechanism"" to ensure it was ""accountable and transparent"". She said it should be backed by sufficient resources, and that children and their families should be central to any evaluation of the scheme. Lucy Reed KC, a family barrister who founded the Transparency Project 10 years ago, said this was a ""very significant development"". She called it a ""major opportunity"" for the media and legal bloggers to help the public understand how the family court works, ""what it does well, and where things need to change"". There has been criticism of the family courts, and calls for greater transparency, for decades. Family judges have the power to make some of the most drastic interventions in people's lives, as they can take children away from their parents and place them in care or up for adoption. Where parents are separating, these courts decide where children should live, and how much contact they should have with each parent. These cases often involve allegations of domestic abuse. The BBC will be continuing to cover family court stories in the new pilot centres. Please get in touch by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

The charity's bases in Shropshire and Staffordshire were both given the top score by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) after visits in August and September. Services were commended for being safe, responsive, effective and well-led. The care offered by staff at the RAF Cosford headquarters and Tatenhill near Burton-on-Trent was rated as good. The charity's crews serve a population of around six million people across Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire, Birmingham, the Black Country and the surrounding areas. CQC inspectors said the services ""always met agreed response times"" and feedback from people was continually positive. Patients and their relatives told inspectors that they were treated with kindness, respect, and dignity and 45 compliments had been received with special thanks being offered to staff. Andy Brand, CQC deputy director of operations in the Midlands, said:  ""We were impressed to find two extremely well-led services that went above and beyond to ensure people were responded to quickly and effectively in emergency situations."" ""It was also positive to see that Midlands Air Ambulance Charity is open to learning and continuous improvement, and the service also reported areas of excellence so staff could learn from events that had gone particularly well. This helped staff to continuously improve and boosted morale and wellbeing."" In April 2022, clinical operations were combined with the headquarters office (previously known as Cosford airbase) bringing both clinical and administrative teams under the same roof for the first time. ""This fantastic achievement highlights our commitment to the patients we treat within the communities we serve, providing the best pre-hospital care to those in critical need,"" said Hanna Sebright, chief executive of Midlands Air Ambulance Charity.

It comes ahead of a legal deadline to restore the executive by next Thursday before fresh elections are required. Signatures from 30 assembly members are required for the petition to succeed. There have been six recalls since May 2022. Every time there has been a vote to elect a Speaker, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has blocked the move. The party's veto, which is unlikely to change before next week's recall, means no other assembly business can take place. The latest legal deadline for the assembly to be restored coincides with a mass strike involving thousands of public sector workers calling for better pay and conditions. The Sinn Féin recall petition is expected to be backed by the Alliance Party and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). In a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said it was ""decision time for the DUP"". ""Our public sector workers play a pivotal role right across our society working in our hospitals, schools, on trains and buses, and within the civil service."" A sitting of the assembly could take place by Wednesday, but parties have to select a new Speaker before they can take any other decisions. The DUP has been blocking the restoration of Stormont's power-sharing institutions since 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trade checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It believes the arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol diminish the region's place within the UK internal market. A new deal, called the Windsor Framework, aimed at addressing those concerns was agreed in February 2023 between the government and European Union. But the DUP said this did not go far enough, and for months the party has been in talks with the government seeking further changes. In December, Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Northern Ireland if the Stormont institutions are restored. That financial package includes almost £600m to solve the pay disputes at the heart of the public sector strikes. The recall petition is seeking to debate a motion supporting those pay demands and calling for the DUP to resume power sharing. If no executive is formed by Thursday, the Northern Ireland secretary is under a legal duty to call an early assembly election. However, Mr Heaton-Harris has pushed this deadline back several times before and has indicated he may do so again. In the last assembly election in May 2022, Sinn Féin became the largest party at Stormont for the first time, pushing the DUP into second place.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67953863,Northern Ireland strikes: Unions asked for special schools exemption,Trade unions have been asked to allow special school staff to come to work during upcoming strike action which will close some schools for eight days.,2024-01-12,"Trade unions have been asked to allow special school staff to come to work during upcoming strike action which will close some schools for eight days. Support staff including bus drivers, canteen workers and classroom assistants will take part in the strikes over pay. The Education Authority (EA) made the exemption plea and union Unite has agreed to meet the EA over the issue. However, unions have turned down the request on previous strike days. Parents have told BBC News NI about their serious concerns over school closures. Ann Marie O'Neill, whose 10-year-old son Eoin has a rare genetic condition, said he is being forgotten. Glenveagh School in Belfast, which Eoin attends, has said it will close on the eight strike days due to the ""degree of staffing deficiency and associated risks"". Ms O'Neill said the disruption will have a ""massive impact"" on Eoin, who is heavily reliant on routine. ""Once again it's the children with special needs who are disproportionately impacted,"" she said. ""The mainstream schools are, at most, impacted for a day but the children who are the most vulnerable are just not being seen and we feel like we're not being heard and that our children don't matter. ""If this was impacting mainstream schools people would be shouting from the rooftops and it wouldn't be allowed to happen."" Emma Morgan, from campaign group SEN Reform NI, said her she was aware of parents who ""burst into tears"" when they heard about the closures. ""People are trying to keep jobs, manage other caring responsibilities,"" she added. ""Many children with additional needs have significant behavioural problems as well so they can be taken out on the parents at home."" Public sector workers in Northern Ireland in areas including health, education and the civil service have been holding a number of strikes over pay disputes. Next Thursday, 18 January, tens of thousands are set to take part in a strike unions have billed as the biggest in Northern Ireland's history. It has since been confirmed by Unite that members who work for the Education Authority as school support staff will be taking part in eight days of strike action on 17-19 January: 24-26 January: and 1-2 February. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said that ""funding to deliver the pay and grading review is available but it is being withheld by the secretary of state for Northern Ireland"". ""It is disgraceful that workers' pay is being used as a political bargaining tool,"" she said. With special schools particularly reliant on support staff, some have said they will be forced to close during the strikes. It has led to the EA asking the unions for exemptions for special school staff to come to work. The authority has made the same request on previous strike days affecting special schools but had been turned down by the unions each time.

Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Unite's Kieran Ellison said: ""Obviously we are not people who have no heart. ""This is done out of necessity.

""We can't replicate all of the things he gets at school and all of that input so it really becomes quite a strain on us trying to juggle everything.""

Ms Morgan, whose five-year-old son Tom attends a social communication unit at a County Down primary school, said it was ""shocking that some of our most vulnerable children are going to be out of school for eight days in comparison to one day"".

A £3.3bn financial package has been tabled by the government, including almost £600m to solve the pay dispute, if the DUP ends its boycott and power-sharing government in Northern Ireland returns.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67963987,Stormont: Sinn Féin in fresh bid to recall assembly before strikes,Sinn Féin is seeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in a fresh attempt to elect a Stormont Speaker.,2024-01-12,"Sinn Féin is seeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in a fresh attempt to elect a Stormont Speaker. It comes ahead of a legal deadline to restore the executive by next Thursday before fresh elections are required. Signatures from 30 assembly members are required for the petition to succeed. There have been six recalls since May 2022. Every time there has been a vote to elect a Speaker, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has blocked the move. The party's veto, which is unlikely to change before next week's recall, means no other assembly business can take place. The latest legal deadline for the assembly to be restored coincides with a mass strike involving thousands of public sector workers calling for better pay and conditions. The Sinn Féin recall petition is expected to be backed by the Alliance Party and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). In a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said it was ""decision time for the DUP"". ""Our public sector workers play a pivotal role right across our society working in our hospitals, schools, on trains and buses, and within the civil service."" A sitting of the assembly could take place by Wednesday, but parties have to select a new Speaker before they can take any other decisions. The DUP has been blocking the restoration of Stormont's power-sharing institutions since 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trade checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It believes the arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol diminish the region's place within the UK internal market. A new deal, called the Windsor Framework, aimed at addressing those concerns was agreed in February 2023 between the government and European Union. But the DUP said this did not go far enough, and for months the party has been in talks with the government seeking further changes. In December, Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Northern Ireland if the Stormont institutions are restored. That financial package includes almost £600m to solve the pay disputes at the heart of the public sector strikes. The recall petition is seeking to debate a motion supporting those pay demands and calling for the DUP to resume power sharing. If no executive is formed by Thursday, the Northern Ireland secretary is under a legal duty to call an early assembly election. However, Mr Heaton-Harris has pushed this deadline back several times before and has indicated he may do so again. In the last assembly election in May 2022, Sinn Féin became the largest party at Stormont for the first time, pushing the DUP into second place. But Stormont's structures governing power-sharing between unionists and nationalists mean an executive cannot be restored without the support of both parties.","['SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party)', 'Alliance Party (Northern Ireland)', 'Northern Ireland Assembly', 'DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Sinn Féin']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/166F/production/_127334750_bf141d25860ddfc601870a8768715828f0d828f9.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B25/production/_132292472_1e6b5100583cda39e9a59daad825248107eb4977.jpg']","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,N.

Katherine McAlerney was brought to court, but was never convicted. She is among a number who have spoken out in recent weeks, including a sub-postmaster who is appealing his conviction for fraud-related offences. Lee Williamson has welcomed new legislation to exonerate Post Office scandal victims. He ran a Post Office in Portstewart between 2003 and 2012. His appeal was adjourned today until there is more clarity on how the legislation announced this week will apply in Northern Ireland. More than 900 people across the UK were prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. Some went to prison for false accounting and theft, others were financially ruined and some lived in constant fear of being sent to prison. Ms McAlerney ran a village post office in Leitrim, near Castlewellan, between 2000 and 2007 and was wrongly accused of stealing thousands of pounds. In 2006, after the Horizon computer system was introduced, she began to notice shortfalls on the system. Auditors were called in after a discrepancy of £30,000 was discovered. ""The auditors arrived en-masse to the Post Office one morning, it was just like the docudrama (Mr Bates vs the Post Office). ""I couldn't believe what was happening, they didn't want to know anything, they already had their minds made up. ""I did suspect that I might be sent to jail because they did say to me if you plead guilty we will go leniently on you. ""It was a great fear that I would end up having to leave the children behind,"" she added. Ms McAlerney was never convicted but was brought to court in a civil action. Lee Williamson, who was convicted, described new laws aimed at exonerating and compensating victims as ""a welcome development"". He was convicted in 2014 after a shortfall of £17,000 was discovered on the Horizon system. He lodged his appeal in 2022. He said he began the process of challenging his conviction as more errors were discovered with the Horizon IT system. ""What has come to light now is that we were fighting an uphill battle to get it to balance,"" he said. ""My appeal is still live at this present time, which is why the decision today has been postponed until events from the legislation come to light. ""The new legislation is a welcome development but there's lots of questions still left to be answered, particularly in Northern Ireland. ""The legislation will initially apply in England and Wales. The legislators in Scotland have come out and stated what they're going to do but nothing has been mentioned in Northern Ireland, which is why we're still holding our position in the appeal court."" Mr Williamson, who received an 18-month sentence, suspended for three years, said his suspension as a sub-postmaster and conviction had a ""devastating"" effect. ""There's very few words that you can describe, just the whole feeling of having a job that you enjoy, you held a position that you felt respected in, to have the whole thing taken away from you. ""It had a detrimental impact on my mental health. I was hospitalised for a period: it took a long time to recover."" Mr Williamson's solicitor, Michael Madden, said he hoped the new legislation would lead to his client's conviction being overturned. ""The hearing today was really focused on the new announcement from the prime minister and Downing Street, to see how that proposed new legislation is going to affect Lee's case,"" he said. ""The hope is these proceedings will become academic, as we're hoping the new legislation will overturn Lee's conviction."" Mr Madden added that the case has been listed for review in April. ""Hopefully by then we'll have a bit more detail on what the proposed legislation is and how that will affect Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""We haven't had any detail at all on how it will enact in Northern Ireland. Obviously the intention was declared that it will be UK wide, and the intention is to have all convictions overturned by the end of this year. ""If that's the intention we would hope, if the political will is there, that would be made happen either through Westminster or Stormont.""","['Post Office Inquiry', 'Post Office Ltd']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17209/production/_132292749_katherinemcalerney.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11402/production/_132285607_leewilliamson.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E277/production/_132257975_gettyimages-1917790465-1.jpg']","['By Michael Fitzpatrick', 'BBC News NI']",UK,N.

Support staff including bus drivers, canteen workers and classroom assistants will take part in the strikes over pay. The Education Authority (EA) made the exemption plea and union Unite has agreed to meet the EA over the issue. However, unions have turned down the request on previous strike days. Parents have told BBC News NI about their serious concerns over school closures. Ann Marie O'Neill, whose 10-year-old son Eoin has a rare genetic condition, said he is being forgotten. Glenveagh School in Belfast, which Eoin attends, has said it will close on the eight strike days due to the ""degree of staffing deficiency and associated risks"". Ms O'Neill said the disruption will have a ""massive impact"" on Eoin, who is heavily reliant on routine. ""Once again it's the children with special needs who are disproportionately impacted,"" she said. ""The mainstream schools are, at most, impacted for a day but the children who are the most vulnerable are just not being seen and we feel like we're not being heard and that our children don't matter. ""If this was impacting mainstream schools people would be shouting from the rooftops and it wouldn't be allowed to happen."" Emma Morgan, from campaign group SEN Reform NI, said her she was aware of parents who ""burst into tears"" when they heard about the closures. ""People are trying to keep jobs, manage other caring responsibilities,"" she added. ""Many children with additional needs have significant behavioural problems as well so they can be taken out on the parents at home."" Public sector workers in Northern Ireland in areas including health, education and the civil service have been holding a number of strikes over pay disputes. Next Thursday, 18 January, tens of thousands are set to take part in a strike unions have billed as the biggest in Northern Ireland's history. It has since been confirmed by Unite that members who work for the Education Authority as school support staff will be taking part in eight days of strike action on 17-19 January: 24-26 January: and 1-2 February. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said that ""funding to deliver the pay and grading review is available but it is being withheld by the secretary of state for Northern Ireland"". ""It is disgraceful that workers' pay is being used as a political bargaining tool,"" she said. With special schools particularly reliant on support staff, some have said they will be forced to close during the strikes. It has led to the EA asking the unions for exemptions for special school staff to come to work.

And it involves egg shells. Ronan Scullion, 13, and Loachra Hill, 14, investigated when relatives living near the lough were affected. The teenagers have been presenting their results at the BT Young Scientist Award in Dublin. Speaking at the event, the students from St Colman's College in Newry said they were driven ""to save our Lough Neagh"". Last summer, blooms of blue-green algae appeared in the UK's largest freshwater lake at levels not seen for half a century. The algae is made up of bacteria, which can cause skin irritation and sickness for those who come into contact with it. The biggest risk is to pets, livestock and wildlife. It emerged due to multiple factors, but pollution is a key part of the problem. Fertiliser run-off from surrounding fields is feeding the bacteria, helping it to spread. A number of dog deaths were reported after the animals swam in affected waters. The students could not use water directly from the lough, so they had to make up a replica version in their school lab. ""We both have family living around the lough, they were seriously affected by that so they had to change their whole lifestyle,"" said Ronan. ""So we decided we wanted to try to help them so they could relive their normal lifestyle again."" Phosphates from fertiliser is a major driver of blue-green algae - but the aspiring scientists found their egg shells could be an answer. ""We got research from University of Malaysia, which said we could use egg shells, which are 96% calcium carbonate,"" Laochra added. ""Through research, we found the calcium carbonate absorbs the phosphates in our solution and in the lough. ""We would still need a lot more experiments to make sure."" The boys sourced a local vendor who gave them recycled egg shells and, through a series of tests, could measure how many shells were needed to de-contaminate the water. This week marks 60 years of the Young Scientist Award, with 90 prizes available for innovation in science and technology with more than 2,000 projects in the running. Students from St Mary's College in Londonderry won the Best School Northern Ireland award and the BT Best Project Northern Ireland. The school was also awarded the 2nd Senior Group title in the Chemical, Physical & Mathematical Sciences category for their project which investigated a method to reclaim lithium from used batteries. Students from St Dominic's High School in Belfast won the BT Health & Wellbeing Award for their project on ""toxic positivity and its long-term effect on mental health"".

Stephen Henry McParland, 55, and Alison Michelle McDonagh, 50, were arrested in Newry in January 2023 after a manhunt. They pleaded guilty to being unlawfully at large. The court heard the pair, who were on the cusp of early release, had possibly deliberately sabotaged themselves. It was told that McParland, whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, was convicted in 1998 for the murder of Gary Alexander McKimm in east Belfast. His trial was told he had punched, kicked and stamped on the victim, who he had been drinking with, in a row over £20. He was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years before being eligible to apply for parole. McDonagh, whose address was given as Hydebank Wood women's prison, was convicted in 2006 for the murder of George McDowell in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. Known at the time as Alison Michelle Martin, she stabbed her victim in the neck after a row. She was sentenced to a minimum tariff of 12 years before being eligible for parole. A prosecution lawyer told the court that both defendants had been out on temporary release from prison on 21 January 2023, but failed to return. A cross-border police manhunt was launched after the pair were spotted on CCTV at a train station in Belfast, with a large number of bags, where they ""boarded a train to Dublin''. ""However, on 26 January 2023 they were returning to the jurisdiction on a train from Dublin to Belfast and were apprehended in Newry,"" the barrister said. ""They have been back in custody since then and that period in custody would not be taken into account as a result of any sentence imposed today. ""Both defendants have been in custody longer than the minimum tariffs they received.'' When asked by Judge Mark Reel what the defendants' actions were all about, a defence lawyer for McParland described it as a ""very, very strange case"". ""He was on the cusp of early release,"" the barrister said. ""At three previous parole hearings the word 'sabotage' was used by various panels who believed that he had become institutionalised. ""Each time he was just about to be released he did something minor that set back his whole release. ""So in this particular case, it is very difficult to work out what he was doing other than that."" He added that the pair travelled to Dublin, where they met gardai (Irish police). ""An unconventional extradition took place where the gardai accompanied them on the train to Newry where they voluntarily got off, met the PSNI and were arrested.'' Asked by the judge what the large amount of luggage was about, the lawyer replied that ""they had plans to start a new life together in the Republic of Ireland"". ""He deeply regrets it,"" he added. ""But it wasn't going to last too long. ""They had no recourse to funds and there were no state benefits available to them. It was always going to end up the way it ended. ""He will have to earn the trust of the prison authorities again and the Parole Commissioners won't release him immediately.'' A defence barrister said McDonagh was approaching almost 20 years in prison and is ""now seven years post-tariff'"". ""She was nine days shy of another Parole Commissioner's release when she went unlawfully at large and to say it was self-sabotage is pretty obvious,'' he said. Passing the six-month sentence, Judge Reel said release on licence from the prison estate is an important feature of the operation of the prison system. ""Prisoners who are released in such a fashion are released on trust and when that trust is breached by a prisoner there is an important public interest in ensuring that those who breach the terms of the release are appropriately punished,"" he added.","['Newry', 'Belfast', 'Dublin']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EC72/production/_128403506_capture.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17656/production/_128403859_mcparlandandmcdonaghlanyontrainstation21.01.23-002.jpg']",,UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67953863,Northern Ireland strikes: Unions asked for special schools exemption,Trade unions have been asked to allow special school staff to come to work during upcoming strike action which will close some schools for eight days.,2024-01-12,"Trade unions have been asked to allow special school staff to come to work during upcoming strike action which will close some schools for eight days. Support staff including bus drivers, canteen workers and classroom assistants will take part in the strikes over pay. The Education Authority (EA) made the exemption plea and union Unite has agreed to meet the EA over the issue. However, unions have turned down the request on previous strike days. Parents have told BBC News NI about their serious concerns over school closures. Ann Marie O'Neill, whose 10-year-old son Eoin has a rare genetic condition, said he is being forgotten. Glenveagh School in Belfast, which Eoin attends, has said it will close on the eight strike days due to the ""degree of staffing deficiency and associated risks"". Ms O'Neill said the disruption will have a ""massive impact"" on Eoin, who is heavily reliant on routine. ""Once again it's the children with special needs who are disproportionately impacted,"" she said. ""The mainstream schools are, at most, impacted for a day but the children who are the most vulnerable are just not being seen and we feel like we're not being heard and that our children don't matter. ""If this was impacting mainstream schools people would be shouting from the rooftops and it wouldn't be allowed to happen."" Emma Morgan, from campaign group SEN Reform NI, said her she was aware of parents who ""burst into tears"" when they heard about the closures. ""People are trying to keep jobs, manage other caring responsibilities,"" she added. ""Many children with additional needs have significant behavioural problems as well so they can be taken out on the parents at home."" Public sector workers in Northern Ireland in areas including health, education and the civil service have been holding a number of strikes over pay disputes. Next Thursday, 18 January, tens of thousands are set to take part in a strike unions have billed as the biggest in Northern Ireland's history. It has since been confirmed by Unite that members who work for the Education Authority as school support staff will be taking part in eight days of strike action on 17-19 January: 24-26 January: and 1-2 February. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said that ""funding to deliver the pay and grading review is available but it is being withheld by the secretary of state for Northern Ireland"". ""It is disgraceful that workers' pay is being used as a political bargaining tool,"" she said. With special schools particularly reliant on support staff, some have said they will be forced to close during the strikes. It has led to the EA asking the unions for exemptions for special school staff to come to work. The authority has made the same request on previous strike days affecting special schools but had been turned down by the unions each time. Unite the Union has said it will meet EA representatives to discuss the request for dispensation before making a decision. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Unite's Kieran Ellison said: ""Obviously we are not people who have no heart. ""This is done out of necessity. Not a single member of Unite the Union has ever said: 'I want to disrupt these children's lives'. In fact, quite the opposite."" Ms O'Neill said the lack of routine caused by the strikes impacts Eoin's sleeping, in particular. ""He already needs 24/7 care so if he's not sleeping during the night then that has a real impact on him and of course on the whole family as well. ""Myself and my husband work full time, so what do you do with a child like Eoin for eight days? ""We can't replicate all of the things he gets at school and all of that input so it really becomes quite a strain on us trying to juggle everything."" Ms O'Neill added that while she supports everyone's right to fair pay and doesn't blame the school, someone ""needs to be accountable for these decisions, or lack of decisions"". Ms Morgan, whose five-year-old son Tom attends a social communication unit at a County Down primary school, said it was ""shocking that some of our most vulnerable children are going to be out of school for eight days in comparison to one day"". She added: ""It's a greater issue that our educators in Northern Ireland are not getting paid in parity with the rest of the UK. ""The educators we have in special education in Northern Ireland are unbelievable people - they're wonderful. ""Staff in special education and in schools in general in Northern Ireland need paid fairly."" Earlier this week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored. A £3.3bn financial package has been tabled by the government, including almost £600m to solve the pay dispute, if the DUP ends its boycott and power-sharing government in Northern Ireland returns. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state and the government had no authority to negotiate public sector pay in Northern Ireland. ""It is for the relevant Northern Ireland departments to negotiate pay policies,"" the spokesperson said. ""The secretary of state has expressed his disappointment that a new executive was not up and running to take the offer on the table and deliver it for the people of Northern Ireland before Christmas. ""It is now for the NI parties to come together, restore the Executive and begin to address the challenges facing the people of Northern Ireland, including public sector pay."" However, Unite said its members ""are clear that our secretary of state continues to fail them badly"". The union added that it understood the EA cannot meaningfully progress the pay dispute ""due to the funding required not being provided by the secretary of state"". In a statement, the Education Authority said: ""The EA will work closely with all schools to implement where possible a range of contingency measures to minimise disruption for children and young people, as we very much recognise the impact that industrial action may have for our pupils, schools, and families. ""EA has asked for a derogation for special school staff as we fully understand that this impacts on the most vulnerable of our children and the EA is making every effort to minimise disruption and keep parents, children and young people informed.""","['Unite', 'NI education', 'Strike action']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BD40/production/_132284484_02fb0ffc-0378-40e8-8133-d7dc649e7e4d_upload.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CD44/production/_132284525_83752b0f19e26b4f4d5b6ffdd61f8ebb48b96957.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/067A/production/_132285610_4937c87d-7414-4053-b535-62b3c8b20031_upload.jpg']",,UK,N.

Katherine McAlerney was brought to court, but was never convicted. She is among a number who have spoken out in recent weeks, including a sub-postmaster who is appealing his conviction for fraud-related offences. Lee Williamson has welcomed new legislation to exonerate Post Office scandal victims. He ran a Post Office in Portstewart between 2003 and 2012. His appeal was adjourned today until there is more clarity on how the legislation announced this week will apply in Northern Ireland. More than 900 people across the UK were prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. Some went to prison for false accounting and theft, others were financially ruined and some lived in constant fear of being sent to prison. Ms McAlerney ran a village post office in Leitrim, near Castlewellan, between 2000 and 2007 and was wrongly accused of stealing thousands of pounds. In 2006, after the Horizon computer system was introduced, she began to notice shortfalls on the system. Auditors were called in after a discrepancy of £30,000 was discovered. ""The auditors arrived en-masse to the Post Office one morning, it was just like the docudrama (Mr Bates vs the Post Office). ""I couldn't believe what was happening, they didn't want to know anything, they already had their minds made up. ""I did suspect that I might be sent to jail because they did say to me if you plead guilty we will go leniently on you. ""It was a great fear that I would end up having to leave the children behind,"" she added. Ms McAlerney was never convicted but was brought to court in a civil action. Lee Williamson, who was convicted, described new laws aimed at exonerating and compensating victims as ""a welcome development"". He was convicted in 2014 after a shortfall of £17,000 was discovered on the Horizon system. He lodged his appeal in 2022. He said he began the process of challenging his conviction as more errors were discovered with the Horizon IT system. ""What has come to light now is that we were fighting an uphill battle to get it to balance,"" he said. ""My appeal is still live at this present time, which is why the decision today has been postponed until events from the legislation come to light. ""The new legislation is a welcome development but there's lots of questions still left to be answered, particularly in Northern Ireland. ""The legislation will initially apply in England and Wales. The legislators in Scotland have come out and stated what they're going to do but nothing has been mentioned in Northern Ireland, which is why we're still holding our position in the appeal court."" Mr Williamson, who received an 18-month sentence, suspended for three years, said his suspension as a sub-postmaster and conviction had a ""devastating"" effect. ""There's very few words that you can describe, just the whole feeling of having a job that you enjoy, you held a position that you felt respected in, to have the whole thing taken away from you. ""It had a detrimental impact on my mental health. I was hospitalised for a period: it took a long time to recover."" Mr Williamson's solicitor, Michael Madden, said he hoped the new legislation would lead to his client's conviction being overturned. ""The hearing today was really focused on the new announcement from the prime minister and Downing Street, to see how that proposed new legislation is going to affect Lee's case,"" he said. ""The hope is these proceedings will become academic, as we're hoping the new legislation will overturn Lee's conviction."" Mr Madden added that the case has been listed for review in April. ""Hopefully by then we'll have a bit more detail on what the proposed legislation is and how that will affect Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""We haven't had any detail at all on how it will enact in Northern Ireland. Obviously the intention was declared that it will be UK wide, and the intention is to have all convictions overturned by the end of this year.

Stephen Henry McParland, 55, and Alison Michelle McDonagh, 50, were arrested in Newry in January 2023 after a manhunt. They pleaded guilty to being unlawfully at large. The court heard the pair, who were on the cusp of early release, had possibly deliberately sabotaged themselves. It was told that McParland, whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, was convicted in 1998 for the murder of Gary Alexander McKimm in east Belfast. His trial was told he had punched, kicked and stamped on the victim, who he had been drinking with, in a row over £20. He was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years before being eligible to apply for parole. McDonagh, whose address was given as Hydebank Wood women's prison, was convicted in 2006 for the murder of George McDowell in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. Known at the time as Alison Michelle Martin, she stabbed her victim in the neck after a row. She was sentenced to a minimum tariff of 12 years before being eligible for parole. A prosecution lawyer told the court that both defendants had been out on temporary release from prison on 21 January 2023, but failed to return. A cross-border police manhunt was launched after the pair were spotted on CCTV at a train station in Belfast, with a large number of bags, where they ""boarded a train to Dublin''. ""However, on 26 January 2023 they were returning to the jurisdiction on a train from Dublin to Belfast and were apprehended in Newry,"" the barrister said. ""They have been back in custody since then and that period in custody would not be taken into account as a result of any sentence imposed today. ""Both defendants have been in custody longer than the minimum tariffs they received.'' When asked by Judge Mark Reel what the defendants' actions were all about, a defence lawyer for McParland described it as a ""very, very strange case"". ""He was on the cusp of early release,"" the barrister said. ""At three previous parole hearings the word 'sabotage' was used by various panels who believed that he had become institutionalised. ""Each time he was just about to be released he did something minor that set back his whole release. ""So in this particular case, it is very difficult to work out what he was doing other than that."" He added that the pair travelled to Dublin, where they met gardai (Irish police). ""An unconventional extradition took place where the gardai accompanied them on the train to Newry where they voluntarily got off, met the PSNI and were arrested.'' Asked by the judge what the large amount of luggage was about, the lawyer replied that ""they had plans to start a new life together in the Republic of Ireland"". ""He deeply regrets it,"" he added. ""But it wasn't going to last too long. ""They had no recourse to funds and there were no state benefits available to them. It was always going to end up the way it ended. ""He will have to earn the trust of the prison authorities again and the Parole Commissioners won't release him immediately.'' A defence barrister said McDonagh was approaching almost 20 years in prison and is ""now seven years post-tariff'"". ""She was nine days shy of another Parole Commissioner's release when she went unlawfully at large and to say it was self-sabotage is pretty obvious,'' he said. Passing the six-month sentence, Judge Reel said release on licence from the prison estate is an important feature of the operation of the prison system.

""Hopefully by then we'll have a bit more detail on what the proposed legislation is and how that will affect Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""We haven't had any detail at all on how it will enact in Northern Ireland. Obviously the intention was declared that it will be UK wide, and the intention is to have all convictions overturned by the end of this year.

It will be in place on Monday between 03:00 and 23:59 GMT and applies to all counties. The Met Office says up to 5cm (2in) of snow is likely over higher routes ""such as the Coleraine mountain road and Glenshane Pass"". At lower levels, a few cms can be expected, with northern counties set to see the more frequent showers. Ice will be an additional hazard for all areas into the evening, the Met Office adds. People have been advised to plan any driving routes, check for road closures and carry extra essentials in their vehicle, such as warm clothing, an ice scraper and a warning triangle. A brisk northerly wind will develop on Sunday, bringing Arctic air southwards on Sunday night into Monday. The Met Office said brisk northerly winds would drive showers well inland across Northern Ireland on Monday, with these initially falling as snow over higher ground and sleet and rain elsewhere. ""However, as increasingly cold air spreads south, showers will fall as snow to all levels by late morning on Monday."" The very cold weather is expected to persist for most of next week with a risk of wintry showers, ice, and temperatures below average by day and by night. The wind will mean an added wind chill making it feel even colder than temperatures suggest. Winds from the Arctic will bring some very cold weather to the UK early next week. There will be some widespread frosts with temperatures as low as -10C in rural parts of the UK.",['Snow'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14FE/production/_128947350_snow10.jpg'],"['By Cecilia Daly', 'BBC News NI weather presenter']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67956427,NI politics: Strike action won't push DUP into Stormont deal,As Northern Ireland edges closer to a day of mass disruption the government and the DUP are locked in a political arm wrestle.,2024-01-12,"As Northern Ireland edges closer to a day of mass disruption the government and the DUP are locked in a political arm wrestle. London is desperate to push the party back into government but the DUP leader is not in a position to pull his party with him. Both sides are now in a standoff. The standoff hardened this week when it became clear the DUP will not be returning to Stormont ahead of Thursdays ""artificial"" deadline. That is the day when Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris will fall under a legal obligation to call a fresh assembly election if no Executive is formed by midnight. He is likely now to amend the legislation to push the deadline back by at least a year. Thursday is also the day when many public services in Northern Ireland will grind to a halt when workers from 15 unions take to the picket line. Meanwhile, the day before, Sinn Féin will seek a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly - the seventh such recall petition to have taken place since May 2022. On each occasion, the DUP has vetoed the election of a Speaker. The government had hoped that unprecedented level of public pressure would force the DUP to end its Stormont boycott. But it is going to be a ""good strike wasted"", as some have described it, as nothing is likely to change by the time workers put away their placards on Thursday night. If anything, the pressure will remain on the secretary of state, who has already accepted the need for pay parity and holds the cheque to make it happen. The unions taking part on Thursday's day of action are directing their fire at Chris Heaton-Harris and not the DUP. As one union leader declared this week - much to the frustration of the NIO - the local political parties are ""irrelevant"". Plan A is clearly not working and next week Chris Heaton-Harris may start working on Plan B. That process will begin on Monday when he meets the parties separately at Hillsborough castle. Expect the secretary of state to harden his language as London has now clearly run out of patience with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Mr Heaton-Harris will once again dangle the £3.3bn cash prize if the DUP return to Stormont. But he may also talk tough around further cuts to MLA salaries and may even threaten to go public with some of the deal offered to the DUP. All of which is unlikely to move the party any closer to Stormont and runs the risk of energising those within the DUP who are strongly opposed to a return to power sharing while any trace of an Irish Sea border remains in place. On Wednesday Chris Heaton-Harris will lead Northern Ireland Questions in the commons and that could be the moment when he spells out the government's next move. He may also commit to setting the budget for next year and striking the regional rate in the absence of an executive. Both of which present opportunities for him to raise the ante even further by talking up the prospect of more financial hardship for public services in Northern Ireland - at a time when there is a £3.3bn cheque waiting to be cashed. But how much longer can the secretary of state hold off releasing the £580m to bring public sector pay into line with the rest of the UK? The Treasury, we are told, is adamant the money will only be handed over as part of the £3.3bn package once Stormont returns. The government is also reluctant to loose the leverage over the DUP which comes with the money. Handing it over without a trade off would remove any hope of the public sector pay pressure being directed at the DUP. Politically it makes sense but morally it is hard to defend. The DUP insists the talks with the government are still ""live"" and has said the onus is on London to break the deadlock. Publishing the legislation which the government believes will secure Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market might be a first step in that direction. There is a lot for Chris Heaton-Harris to consider over the weekend while the rest of the cabinet focus on the fallout from the air strikes in Yemen. It will be a real test of his power-lifting skills if he plans to strong arm the DUP back into government. Muscle alone won't be enough.","['DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Northern Ireland Assembly']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/43CE/production/_132285371_fe694b8982d2f88e4a993a2c9052c749cb070f0b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/158F4/production/_119180388_sirjeffrey.jpg']","['By Enda McClafferty', 'BBC News NI political editor']",UK,N.

Mr Conway was killed in Rossnareen Park in the Greenan area on Tuesday night. The 26-year-old was on bail after being charged with involvement in the January 2023 murder of Shane Whitla in Lurgan. The shooting has been linked to an organised crime gang known as The Firm.

The US comedian spent a few months based just outside Belfast, at the Culloden Hotel, last year. During his stay, he performed a number of gigs in the city - some of which were a surprise - at the Limelight venue and Lavery's bar. Lift is the second Netflix film to be shot in Northern Ireland following The School for Good and Evil in 2021. It was filmed in Harbour Studios and on location across Northern Ireland, with support from Northern Ireland Screen. Ulster University, Titanic Hotel, the Crown Liquor Saloon and Riddel's Warehouse in Belfast, Castle Ward near Strangford, Shackleton Barracks in Ballykelly, Ward Park in Bangor, Whitehead railway station and Ardglass harbour were among the locations used. Directed by F Gary Gray, Lift sees an international heist crew, led by Kevin Hart's character Cyrus Whitaker, try to take $500m (£393m) in gold from a passenger plane before it ends up in the wrong hands. Chief executive of Northern Ireland Screen Richard Williams said: ""The dedication and craftmanship of the local crew complemented the work of global players Kevin Hart and F Gary Gray to bring this eagerly anticipated film to life."" Last year the UK government said that screen productions in Northern Ireland have directly contributed more than £330m to the local economy since 2018. While filming in Belfast, Philadelphia native Hart did a number of comedy shows in venues around the city. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster Programme, local comedian Paddy McDonnell told the story of how this came about. ""I do know that he did think about doing a comedy set in Belfast because he had never done it and went down and watched comedy incognito and then [said], 'Maybe we'll approach these guys and do one without telling the audience' - and that's exactly what happened."" Hart made his surprise appearance in Lavery's on St Patrick's Day 2022 and went on to perform at other venues including the Limelight and the SSE arena. Mr Williams told the programme that the fact that Hart apparently had a good time while in Belfast would be good for Northern Ireland's entertainment industry. ""The development of a cultural scene, of a creative industry scene, is all about word of mouth. It's all about reputation: it's all about what people say about it.""","['Belfast', 'Kevin Hart']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A386/production/_116926814_gettyimages-1193044293.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8D6A/production/_127520263_belfastharbourstudios.jpg']",,UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67950027,Riddel's Warehouse: Plea to council to help restore Victorian building,The owner of one of Belfast's oldest buildings has appealed to the city council to help with its restoration.,2024-01-12,"The owner of one of Belfast's oldest buildings has appealed to the city council to help with its restoration. More than £8m is required to fully restore the 150-year-old Riddel's Warehouse in the city centre but a request for funding from the council was turned down on Monday. Hearth Historic Buildings Trust, which owns the building, is unhappy with how its application was handled. It is considering a number of options, including legal action. The restoration project was initially earmarked to receive almost £225,000 from the council's Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund but, in the end, it was not allocated any money. Hearth committee member Karen Latimer said: ""It was a huge disappointment and very worrying. We needed that money to lever external money into the city. ""Riddel's Warehouse is a rare survivor of Belfast's Victorian past and is uniquely placed to attract visitors."" There are plans to turn the warehouse into a creative hub, with room for small offices, a cafe and an event space with capacity for 150-200 people. The building, on Ann Street, was constructed in 1867 as a four-storey ironmongery warehouse. It operated until the early 1970s, when the outbreak of the Troubles in Belfast forced a relocation. The police took over the building, which is located beside Musgrave Police Station, in the 1980s but in 2014 it was bought by Hearth. ""What we want to do is combine community and business, which is something that Belfast needs,"" Ms Latimer said. In a direct appeal to the city council, she asked: ""Is there any other help you can offer? Are there any other pots of money available? ""Funding from other sources enables us to match funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and lever approximately three times as much money into the city."" On the rejection of the recent funding bid, she said: ""We are going to consider our options, whether we follow this up through legal routes or whether we follow it up with the council. ""I think that would be the preferred option - to talk to people and see where we go from here."" However, she made it clear that legal action had not been ruled out, at this stage. In a statement, a council spokesperson said: ""While Hearth Historic Buildings Trust has not been allocated neighbourhood renewal funds at this stage of the programme, they will be offered the opportunity to be held as a reserve project. ""Elected members may revisit the reserve projects if an opportunity becomes available under the fund in future. ""There are not currently any other council capital funding programmes open to applicants. ""Council officers will however, continue to signpost projects to non-council capital funding opportunities if they become available."" Before the final decision was made on the council funding allocations, there was political row at Belfast City Hall when it emerged that a charity for children with special needs, Sólás, was facing a potential 97% drop in the amount of money it was initially earmarked to receive. At one stage, it was in line to receive £800,000 then it fell to £24,744 but ended up being earmarked for more than £300,000. Two representatives from Sólás addressed the monthly meeting of the council. Hearth said it only heard about the proposed funding from a third party on the day of the full council meeting and, although representatives were at the meeting, they were not aware of an opportunity to apply to speak. Regarding speaking rights, a Belfast City Council spokesperson said: ""A request was received on 19 December 2023 from Sólás to address the council on the topic of disability community services and inclusion in south Belfast. ""No groups applying for the Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund were invited to address the council meeting about their application for funding."" Hearth said that if Riddel's Warehouse is fully restored it will bring jobs to the city, contribute to heritage-led regeneration and be environmentally friendly. Ms Latimer said: ""The most sustainable building is the building that's already there.""","['Listed buildings', 'Belfast', 'Belfast City Council']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2862/production/_132283301_warehousenmni1955.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6A66/production/_132283272_interior.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/106A6/production/_132283276_warehouse.jpg']","['By Mark Simpson', 'BBC News NI community correspondent']",UK,N.

And it involves egg shells. Ronan Scullion, 13, and Loachra Hill, 14, investigated when relatives living near the lough were affected. The teenagers have been presenting their results at the BT Young Scientist Award in Dublin. Speaking at the event, the students from St Colman's College in Newry said they were driven ""to save our Lough Neagh"". Last summer, blooms of blue-green algae appeared in the UK's largest freshwater lake at levels not seen for half a century. The algae is made up of bacteria, which can cause skin irritation and sickness for those who come into contact with it. The biggest risk is to pets, livestock and wildlife. It emerged due to multiple factors, but pollution is a key part of the problem. Fertiliser run-off from surrounding fields is feeding the bacteria, helping it to spread. A number of dog deaths were reported after the animals swam in affected waters. The students could not use water directly from the lough, so they had to make up a replica version in their school lab. ""We both have family living around the lough, they were seriously affected by that so they had to change their whole lifestyle,"" said Ronan. ""So we decided we wanted to try to help them so they could relive their normal lifestyle again."" Phosphates from fertiliser is a major driver of blue-green algae - but the aspiring scientists found their egg shells could be an answer. ""We got research from University of Malaysia, which said we could use egg shells, which are 96% calcium carbonate,"" Laochra added. ""Through research, we found the calcium carbonate absorbs the phosphates in our solution and in the lough. ""We would still need a lot more experiments to make sure."" The boys sourced a local vendor who gave them recycled egg shells and, through a series of tests, could measure how many shells were needed to de-contaminate the water.

The National Development Plan (NDP) was published in 2018 and updated in 2021. It set out a €165bn (£142bn) programme of infrastructure investment in things like housing, transport and energy. But the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) said the plan ""may have underestimated what is needed"".It added that the challenge now is how to increase investment without fuelling inflation. The government had asked the ESRI to assess what had changed since 2021, which would impact on investment needs and the capacity of the economy to deliver them. The major developments have been a strong economic recovery from the pandemic and rapid population growth, driven by immigration. The ESRI said that means that, for example, ""it is almost certain that existing targets for housing supply understate need, given the stronger than expected increase in the population shown by early results from the 2022 Census"". It added: ""Hence, higher output will be needed.""However, very low unemployment means it will be difficult to grow the construction workforce needed to build all the intended projects. ESRI director Alan Barrett said the Irish government faces a dilemma. ""On the one hand, there is a clear need for investment in public infrastructure as our population and economy grow and our climate targets remain challenging,"" he added. ""However, on the other hand, the economy is operating at full employment, so the resources needed to accelerate the NDP are not readily available.""The ESRI has recommended that the government re-examine the sequencing of projects and potentially prioritise those which have the potential to ease inflationary pressures or which are less labour intensive.",['Republic of Ireland'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/880/cpsprodpb/50c8/live/1ed40b80-b0e0-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg'],"['John Campbell', 'BBC News NI economics and business editor']",UK,N.

Katherine McAlerney was brought to court, but was never convicted. She is among a number who have spoken out in recent weeks, including a sub-postmaster who is appealing his conviction for fraud-related offences. Lee Williamson has welcomed new legislation to exonerate Post Office scandal victims. He ran a Post Office in Portstewart between 2003 and 2012. His appeal was adjourned today until there is more clarity on how the legislation announced this week will apply in Northern Ireland. More than 900 people across the UK were prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing. Some went to prison for false accounting and theft, others were financially ruined and some lived in constant fear of being sent to prison. Ms McAlerney ran a village post office in Leitrim, near Castlewellan, between 2000 and 2007 and was wrongly accused of stealing thousands of pounds. In 2006, after the Horizon computer system was introduced, she began to notice shortfalls on the system. Auditors were called in after a discrepancy of £30,000 was discovered. ""The auditors arrived en-masse to the Post Office one morning, it was just like the docudrama (Mr Bates vs the Post Office). ""I couldn't believe what was happening, they didn't want to know anything, they already had their minds made up. ""I did suspect that I might be sent to jail because they did say to me if you plead guilty we will go leniently on you. ""It was a great fear that I would end up having to leave the children behind,"" she added. Ms McAlerney was never convicted but was brought to court in a civil action. Lee Williamson, who was convicted, described new laws aimed at exonerating and compensating victims as ""a welcome development"". He was convicted in 2014 after a shortfall of £17,000 was discovered on the Horizon system. He lodged his appeal in 2022. He said he began the process of challenging his conviction as more errors were discovered with the Horizon IT system. ""What has come to light now is that we were fighting an uphill battle to get it to balance,"" he said. ""My appeal is still live at this present time, which is why the decision today has been postponed until events from the legislation come to light. ""The new legislation is a welcome development but there's lots of questions still left to be answered, particularly in Northern Ireland. ""The legislation will initially apply in England and Wales. The legislators in Scotland have come out and stated what they're going to do but nothing has been mentioned in Northern Ireland, which is why we're still holding our position in the appeal court."" Mr Williamson, who received an 18-month sentence, suspended for three years, said his suspension as a sub-postmaster and conviction had a ""devastating"" effect.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67963987,Stormont: Sinn Féin in fresh bid to recall assembly before strikes,Sinn Féin is seeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in a fresh attempt to elect a Stormont Speaker.,2024-01-12,"Sinn Féin is seeking a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in a fresh attempt to elect a Stormont Speaker. It comes ahead of a legal deadline to restore the executive by next Thursday before fresh elections are required. Signatures from 30 assembly members are required for the petition to succeed. There have been six recalls since May 2022. Every time there has been a vote to elect a Speaker, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has blocked the move. The party's veto, which is unlikely to change before next week's recall, means no other assembly business can take place. The latest legal deadline for the assembly to be restored coincides with a mass strike involving thousands of public sector workers calling for better pay and conditions. The Sinn Féin recall petition is expected to be backed by the Alliance Party and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). In a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said it was ""decision time for the DUP"". ""Our public sector workers play a pivotal role right across our society working in our hospitals, schools, on trains and buses, and within the civil service."" A sitting of the assembly could take place by Wednesday, but parties have to select a new Speaker before they can take any other decisions. The DUP has been blocking the restoration of Stormont's power-sharing institutions since 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trade checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It believes the arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol diminish the region's place within the UK internal market. A new deal, called the Windsor Framework, aimed at addressing those concerns was agreed in February 2023 between the government and European Union. But the DUP said this did not go far enough, and for months the party has been in talks with the government seeking further changes. In December, Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Northern Ireland if the Stormont institutions are restored. That financial package includes almost £600m to solve the pay disputes at the heart of the public sector strikes. The recall petition is seeking to debate a motion supporting those pay demands and calling for the DUP to resume power sharing. If no executive is formed by Thursday, the Northern Ireland secretary is under a legal duty to call an early assembly election. However, Mr Heaton-Harris has pushed this deadline back several times before and has indicated he may do so again. In the last assembly election in May 2022, Sinn Féin became the largest party at Stormont for the first time, pushing the DUP into second place. But Stormont's structures governing power-sharing between unionists and nationalists mean an executive cannot be restored without the support of both parties.","['SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party)', 'Alliance Party (Northern Ireland)', 'Northern Ireland Assembly', 'DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Sinn Féin']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/166F/production/_127334750_bf141d25860ddfc601870a8768715828f0d828f9.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B25/production/_132292472_1e6b5100583cda39e9a59daad825248107eb4977.jpg']","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67953863,Northern Ireland strikes: Unions asked for special schools exemption,Trade unions have been asked to allow special school staff to come to work during upcoming strike action which will close some schools for eight days.,2024-01-12,"Trade unions have been asked to allow special school staff to come to work during upcoming strike action which will close some schools for eight days. Support staff including bus drivers, canteen workers and classroom assistants will take part in the strikes over pay. The Education Authority (EA) made the exemption plea and union Unite has agreed to meet the EA over the issue. However, unions have turned down the request on previous strike days. Parents have told BBC News NI about their serious concerns over school closures. Ann Marie O'Neill, whose 10-year-old son Eoin has a rare genetic condition, said he is being forgotten. Glenveagh School in Belfast, which Eoin attends, has said it will close on the eight strike days due to the ""degree of staffing deficiency and associated risks"". Ms O'Neill said the disruption will have a ""massive impact"" on Eoin, who is heavily reliant on routine. ""Once again it's the children with special needs who are disproportionately impacted,"" she said. ""The mainstream schools are, at most, impacted for a day but the children who are the most vulnerable are just not being seen and we feel like we're not being heard and that our children don't matter. ""If this was impacting mainstream schools people would be shouting from the rooftops and it wouldn't be allowed to happen."" Emma Morgan, from campaign group SEN Reform NI, said her she was aware of parents who ""burst into tears"" when they heard about the closures. ""People are trying to keep jobs, manage other caring responsibilities,"" she added. ""Many children with additional needs have significant behavioural problems as well so they can be taken out on the parents at home."" Public sector workers in Northern Ireland in areas including health, education and the civil service have been holding a number of strikes over pay disputes. Next Thursday, 18 January, tens of thousands are set to take part in a strike unions have billed as the biggest in Northern Ireland's history. It has since been confirmed by Unite that members who work for the Education Authority as school support staff will be taking part in eight days of strike action on 17-19 January: 24-26 January: and 1-2 February. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said that ""funding to deliver the pay and grading review is available but it is being withheld by the secretary of state for Northern Ireland"". ""It is disgraceful that workers' pay is being used as a political bargaining tool,"" she said. With special schools particularly reliant on support staff, some have said they will be forced to close during the strikes. It has led to the EA asking the unions for exemptions for special school staff to come to work. The authority has made the same request on previous strike days affecting special schools but had been turned down by the unions each time. Unite the Union has said it will meet EA representatives to discuss the request for dispensation before making a decision. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Unite's Kieran Ellison said: ""Obviously we are not people who have no heart. ""This is done out of necessity. Not a single member of Unite the Union has ever said: 'I want to disrupt these children's lives'. In fact, quite the opposite."" Ms O'Neill said the lack of routine caused by the strikes impacts Eoin's sleeping, in particular. ""He already needs 24/7 care so if he's not sleeping during the night then that has a real impact on him and of course on the whole family as well. ""Myself and my husband work full time, so what do you do with a child like Eoin for eight days? ""We can't replicate all of the things he gets at school and all of that input so it really becomes quite a strain on us trying to juggle everything."" Ms O'Neill added that while she supports everyone's right to fair pay and doesn't blame the school, someone ""needs to be accountable for these decisions, or lack of decisions"". Ms Morgan, whose five-year-old son Tom attends a social communication unit at a County Down primary school, said it was ""shocking that some of our most vulnerable children are going to be out of school for eight days in comparison to one day"". She added: ""It's a greater issue that our educators in Northern Ireland are not getting paid in parity with the rest of the UK. ""The educators we have in special education in Northern Ireland are unbelievable people - they're wonderful. ""Staff in special education and in schools in general in Northern Ireland need paid fairly."" Earlier this week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said public sector pay disputes in Northern Ireland could be resolved ""rapidly"" if the Stormont executive was restored. A £3.3bn financial package has been tabled by the government, including almost £600m to solve the pay dispute, if the DUP ends its boycott and power-sharing government in Northern Ireland returns. A Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said the secretary of state and the government had no authority to negotiate public sector pay in Northern Ireland. ""It is for the relevant Northern Ireland departments to negotiate pay policies,"" the spokesperson said. ""The secretary of state has expressed his disappointment that a new executive was not up and running to take the offer on the table and deliver it for the people of Northern Ireland before Christmas. ""It is now for the NI parties to come together, restore the Executive and begin to address the challenges facing the people of Northern Ireland, including public sector pay."" However, Unite said its members ""are clear that our secretary of state continues to fail them badly"". The union added that it understood the EA cannot meaningfully progress the pay dispute ""due to the funding required not being provided by the secretary of state"". In a statement, the Education Authority said: ""The EA will work closely with all schools to implement where possible a range of contingency measures to minimise disruption for children and young people, as we very much recognise the impact that industrial action may have for our pupils, schools, and families. ""EA has asked for a derogation for special school staff as we fully understand that this impacts on the most vulnerable of our children and the EA is making every effort to minimise disruption and keep parents, children and young people informed.""","['Unite', 'NI education', 'Strike action']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BD40/production/_132284484_02fb0ffc-0378-40e8-8133-d7dc649e7e4d_upload.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CD44/production/_132284525_83752b0f19e26b4f4d5b6ffdd61f8ebb48b96957.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/067A/production/_132285610_4937c87d-7414-4053-b535-62b3c8b20031_upload.jpg']",,UK,N.

A brisk northerly wind will develop on Sunday, bringing Arctic air southwards on Sunday night into Monday. The Met Office said brisk northerly winds would drive showers well inland across Northern Ireland on Monday, with these initially falling as snow over higher ground and sleet and rain elsewhere. ""However, as increasingly cold air spreads south, showers will fall as snow to all levels by late morning on Monday."" The very cold weather is expected to persist for most of next week with a risk of wintry showers, ice, and temperatures below average by day and by night.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67959841,Murderers Stephen McParland and Alison McDonagh sentenced for escape bid,"Two convicted murderers who went on the run while on temporary jail release to ""start a new life in the Republic of Ireland'' have been sentenced to six months in prison.",2024-01-12,"Two convicted murderers who went on the run while on temporary jail release to ""start a new life in the Republic of Ireland'' have been sentenced to six months in prison. Stephen Henry McParland, 55, and Alison Michelle McDonagh, 50, were arrested in Newry in January 2023 after a manhunt. They pleaded guilty to being unlawfully at large. The court heard the pair, who were on the cusp of early release, had possibly deliberately sabotaged themselves. It was told that McParland, whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, was convicted in 1998 for the murder of Gary Alexander McKimm in east Belfast. His trial was told he had punched, kicked and stamped on the victim, who he had been drinking with, in a row over £20. He was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years before being eligible to apply for parole. McDonagh, whose address was given as Hydebank Wood women's prison, was convicted in 2006 for the murder of George McDowell in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. Known at the time as Alison Michelle Martin, she stabbed her victim in the neck after a row. She was sentenced to a minimum tariff of 12 years before being eligible for parole. A prosecution lawyer told the court that both defendants had been out on temporary release from prison on 21 January 2023, but failed to return. A cross-border police manhunt was launched after the pair were spotted on CCTV at a train station in Belfast, with a large number of bags, where they ""boarded a train to Dublin''. ""However, on 26 January 2023 they were returning to the jurisdiction on a train from Dublin to Belfast and were apprehended in Newry,"" the barrister said. ""They have been back in custody since then and that period in custody would not be taken into account as a result of any sentence imposed today. ""Both defendants have been in custody longer than the minimum tariffs they received.'' When asked by Judge Mark Reel what the defendants' actions were all about, a defence lawyer for McParland described it as a ""very, very strange case"". ""He was on the cusp of early release,"" the barrister said. ""At three previous parole hearings the word 'sabotage' was used by various panels who believed that he had become institutionalised. ""Each time he was just about to be released he did something minor that set back his whole release. ""So in this particular case, it is very difficult to work out what he was doing other than that."" He added that the pair travelled to Dublin, where they met gardai (Irish police). ""An unconventional extradition took place where the gardai accompanied them on the train to Newry where they voluntarily got off, met the PSNI and were arrested.'' Asked by the judge what the large amount of luggage was about, the lawyer replied that ""they had plans to start a new life together in the Republic of Ireland"". ""He deeply regrets it,"" he added. ""But it wasn't going to last too long. ""They had no recourse to funds and there were no state benefits available to them. It was always going to end up the way it ended. ""He will have to earn the trust of the prison authorities again and the Parole Commissioners won't release him immediately.'' A defence barrister said McDonagh was approaching almost 20 years in prison and is ""now seven years post-tariff'"". ""She was nine days shy of another Parole Commissioner's release when she went unlawfully at large and to say it was self-sabotage is pretty obvious,'' he said. Passing the six-month sentence, Judge Reel said release on licence from the prison estate is an important feature of the operation of the prison system. ""Prisoners who are released in such a fashion are released on trust and when that trust is breached by a prisoner there is an important public interest in ensuring that those who breach the terms of the release are appropriately punished,"" he added.","['Newry', 'Belfast', 'Dublin']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EC72/production/_128403506_capture.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17656/production/_128403859_mcparlandandmcdonaghlanyontrainstation21.01.23-002.jpg']",,UK,N.

London is desperate to push the party back into government but the DUP leader is not in a position to pull his party with him. Both sides are now in a standoff. The standoff hardened this week when it became clear the DUP will not be returning to Stormont ahead of Thursdays ""artificial"" deadline. That is the day when Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris will fall under a legal obligation to call a fresh assembly election if no Executive is formed by midnight. He is likely now to amend the legislation to push the deadline back by at least a year. Thursday is also the day when many public services in Northern Ireland will grind to a halt when workers from 15 unions take to the picket line. Meanwhile, the day before, Sinn Féin will seek a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly - the seventh such recall petition to have taken place since May 2022. On each occasion, the DUP has vetoed the election of a Speaker. The government had hoped that unprecedented level of public pressure would force the DUP to end its Stormont boycott. But it is going to be a ""good strike wasted"", as some have described it, as nothing is likely to change by the time workers put away their placards on Thursday night. If anything, the pressure will remain on the secretary of state, who has already accepted the need for pay parity and holds the cheque to make it happen. The unions taking part on Thursday's day of action are directing their fire at Chris Heaton-Harris and not the DUP. As one union leader declared this week - much to the frustration of the NIO - the local political parties are ""irrelevant"". Plan A is clearly not working and next week Chris Heaton-Harris may start working on Plan B. That process will begin on Monday when he meets the parties separately at Hillsborough castle. Expect the secretary of state to harden his language as London has now clearly run out of patience with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Mr Heaton-Harris will once again dangle the £3.3bn cash prize if the DUP return to Stormont. But he may also talk tough around further cuts to MLA salaries and may even threaten to go public with some of the deal offered to the DUP. All of which is unlikely to move the party any closer to Stormont and runs the risk of energising those within the DUP who are strongly opposed to a return to power sharing while any trace of an Irish Sea border remains in place. On Wednesday Chris Heaton-Harris will lead Northern Ireland Questions in the commons and that could be the moment when he spells out the government's next move. He may also commit to setting the budget for next year and striking the regional rate in the absence of an executive. Both of which present opportunities for him to raise the ante even further by talking up the prospect of more financial hardship for public services in Northern Ireland - at a time when there is a £3.3bn cheque waiting to be cashed. But how much longer can the secretary of state hold off releasing the £580m to bring public sector pay into line with the rest of the UK? The Treasury, we are told, is adamant the money will only be handed over as part of the £3.3bn package once Stormont returns. The government is also reluctant to loose the leverage over the DUP which comes with the money. Handing it over without a trade off would remove any hope of the public sector pay pressure being directed at the DUP. Politically it makes sense but morally it is hard to defend. The DUP insists the talks with the government are still ""live"" and has said the onus is on London to break the deadlock. Publishing the legislation which the government believes will secure Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market might be a first step in that direction. There is a lot for Chris Heaton-Harris to consider over the weekend while the rest of the cabinet focus on the fallout from the air strikes in Yemen. It will be a real test of his power-lifting skills if he plans to strong arm the DUP back into government. Muscle alone won't be enough.","['DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Northern Ireland Assembly']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/43CE/production/_132285371_fe694b8982d2f88e4a993a2c9052c749cb070f0b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/158F4/production/_119180388_sirjeffrey.jpg']","['By Enda McClafferty', 'BBC News NI political editor']",UK,N.

Sir Robert Buckland said any alternative to the DUP agreeing a deal would likely mean the ""involvement of the Irish government"". The chair of Westminster's NI Affairs Committee called on the party to show courage. The DUP is boycotting Stormont over its protest against post-Brexit trade rules. In negotiations before Christmas, the government offered a £3.3bn financial package should the power-sharing executive return to Stormont. However, the DUP said more work is needed to be done in order for it to agree to return to devolved government in Northern Ireland. Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris has invited Northern Ireland's five largest parties for one-to-one talks at Hillsborough Castle on Monday. Devolution must be restored by Thursday night or Mr Heaton-Harris is legally obliged to call a fresh assembly election. However, the government has so far downplayed the prospect of calling an election and it can instead opt to legislate for a further delay. Sir Robert, speaking to BBC News NI's The View programme, was asked about comments by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, in which he told the Irish News there can be no return to ""direct rule or some form of Tory administration in the north"" and called for an ""enhanced role for the Irish government"". The Conservative MP said direct rule would mean ""triggering certain aspects of the Good Friday Agreement"" and ""involvement of the Irish government, ultimately"". When asked if ""old-style direct rule of the past"" was off the table, he responded: ""I think so. ""I think anybody who like many of us will have remembered and read and committed parts of the process of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement to memory, will know there is no going back to that previous dispensation. ""That would be to upend 26 years of progress. And that is what is at stake here."" Sir Robert described the government's £3.3bn offer as generous and denied that it was using ongoing strikes in Northern Ireland as a means to pressure the DUP into a deal. Public sector workers, including healthcare workers, education staff and civil servants, have been holding a number of strikes over pay. The government's offer includes £584m to solve public sector pay issues. ""I think on one level it's maybe a cynical view about how the UK government would view the valued contribution that public service workers make in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The reality is this facing all of us -  all of us as elected politicians have responsibilities to face up to. ""Sometimes we have to make decisions that we don't particularly like, we don't live in a perfect world. The DUP are part of this imperfect world. There isn't a perfect solution for them. ""But there is a solution and a solution that can deliver for their constituents, many of whom are public sector workers, in a way that I think would redound to their credit."" He added: ""That's why I think now is the time for leadership, for courage if you like - an overused word sometimes, but one that might apply in this case - to allow the executive to be formed as quickly as possible."" DUP MP Sammy Wilson in a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, said Sir Robert had ""shown himself to be an arrogant little pipsqueak"" and called for him to apologise for his comments. Earlier, DUP deputy leader Gavin Robinson said Sir Robert was ""wrong"" and should ""focus on the restoration of Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market rather than making hollow threats about joint authority"". ""Sir Robert Buckland seems to be confused,"" Mr Robinson said. ""It's not often he is wrong but on this he is. The Republic of Ireland has no legal basis for governing Northern Ireland. Such a step would be a further breach of the Belfast and successor agreements."" Mr Robinson said it was the ""arrangements flowing from the NI Protocol alone"" that are stopping the formation of an executive. Monday's talks will discuss ongoing efforts to restore the executive. Before Christmas, when the secretary of state made the £3.3bn financial offer, he said it was ""time for [the DUP] to take some decisions"". The package includes £584m to address public sector pay issues, which has been at the heart of a series of strikes. Tens of thousands of workers including nurses, teachers and civil servants are taking part in a mass industrial action, billed by unions as the biggest strike in Northern Ireland's history., on Thursday, 18 January. But, before Christmas, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal did not offer a ""basis to deliver the financial stability Northern Ireland needs"". The party collapsed the devolved institutions almost two years ago in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey said there was no agreement with the government over the Windsor Framework, which the party says damages the economy and undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK.","['Sir Jeffrey Donaldson', 'DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Robert Buckland', 'Northern Ireland Assembly']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5814/production/_132284522_fbc4bd0dc42359a094027efd53f055148c623544.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11F2E/production/_132281537_gettyimages-1126962340.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10FA2/production/_132283596_bfe8437cccb42637441e312bef9d3cd981579cdc.jpg']",,UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67956481,Bovine TB: Cuts proposed to cattle compensation rates,A consultation on reducing compensation rates for cattle with bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has begun.,2024-01-12,"A consultation on reducing compensation rates for cattle with bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has begun. It follows an instruction from the Northern Ireland secretary to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) in light of public expenditure pressures. Farmers are currently compensated on a full market value basis for each animal. Compensation made up £38m of the record £53m cost of the 2022/23 bTB programme. Daera is seeking views on whether the payment should be reduced on a phased basis. That would see the amount paid reduced to 90% in the first year of implementation and 75% a year later. The consultation will run for eight weeks. It consists of a single question: ""Do you agree that public expenditure savings should be made by reducing the compensation rate for animals removed under the bTB programme?"" The cattle industry is worth £2.1bn a year to the Northern Ireland economy. Overall disease rates have risen since 2020. At the same time, increased market values mean the bTB programme has seen a significant rise in costs, particularly in compensation. A bTB eradication strategy was announced by the former Daera minister Edwin Poots in March 2022. It included a cull of badgers. But that was quashed by the High Court on the basis of the consultation being flawed. Daera says the costs of the bTB programme ""cannot be sustained"". This is the latest in a series of revenue-raising consultations ordered by Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris. He says generating revenue is ""not merely an option but a critical necessity"" to improve the sustainability of Stormont's finances. The government's proposed £3.3bn funding package for Northern Ireland, to be released if Stormont is restored, would require an excutive to raise more revenue, mostly likely through rates. The consultation on rates, which are a property tax, would remove various exemptions and require the owners of the most valuable houses to pay more. Last month a consultation began on options for household water charges. Unlike other parts of the UK, households in Northern Ireland are not billed for water. The water system in Northern Ireland is largely funded by government resources rather than consumer charges. The water company, NI Water, is government owned. Direct water charging would be the single biggest revenue raiser but is politically controversial and is highly unlikely to be imposed by a devolved Executive.",['NI agriculture'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/84B7/production/_126057933__119447785_hi057149511.jpg'],"['By Louise Cullen & John Campbell', 'BBC News NI']",UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67950027,Riddel's Warehouse: Plea to council to help restore Victorian building,The owner of one of Belfast's oldest buildings has appealed to the city council to help with its restoration.,2024-01-12,"The owner of one of Belfast's oldest buildings has appealed to the city council to help with its restoration. More than £8m is required to fully restore the 150-year-old Riddel's Warehouse in the city centre but a request for funding from the council was turned down on Monday. Hearth Historic Buildings Trust, which owns the building, is unhappy with how its application was handled. It is considering a number of options, including legal action. The restoration project was initially earmarked to receive almost £225,000 from the council's Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund but, in the end, it was not allocated any money. Hearth committee member Karen Latimer said: ""It was a huge disappointment and very worrying. We needed that money to lever external money into the city. ""Riddel's Warehouse is a rare survivor of Belfast's Victorian past and is uniquely placed to attract visitors."" There are plans to turn the warehouse into a creative hub, with room for small offices, a cafe and an event space with capacity for 150-200 people. The building, on Ann Street, was constructed in 1867 as a four-storey ironmongery warehouse. It operated until the early 1970s, when the outbreak of the Troubles in Belfast forced a relocation. The police took over the building, which is located beside Musgrave Police Station, in the 1980s but in 2014 it was bought by Hearth. ""What we want to do is combine community and business, which is something that Belfast needs,"" Ms Latimer said. In a direct appeal to the city council, she asked: ""Is there any other help you can offer? Are there any other pots of money available? ""Funding from other sources enables us to match funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and lever approximately three times as much money into the city."" On the rejection of the recent funding bid, she said: ""We are going to consider our options, whether we follow this up through legal routes or whether we follow it up with the council. ""I think that would be the preferred option - to talk to people and see where we go from here."" However, she made it clear that legal action had not been ruled out, at this stage. In a statement, a council spokesperson said: ""While Hearth Historic Buildings Trust has not been allocated neighbourhood renewal funds at this stage of the programme, they will be offered the opportunity to be held as a reserve project. ""Elected members may revisit the reserve projects if an opportunity becomes available under the fund in future. ""There are not currently any other council capital funding programmes open to applicants. ""Council officers will however, continue to signpost projects to non-council capital funding opportunities if they become available."" Before the final decision was made on the council funding allocations, there was political row at Belfast City Hall when it emerged that a charity for children with special needs, Sólás, was facing a potential 97% drop in the amount of money it was initially earmarked to receive. At one stage, it was in line to receive £800,000 then it fell to £24,744 but ended up being earmarked for more than £300,000. Two representatives from Sólás addressed the monthly meeting of the council. Hearth said it only heard about the proposed funding from a third party on the day of the full council meeting and, although representatives were at the meeting, they were not aware of an opportunity to apply to speak. Regarding speaking rights, a Belfast City Council spokesperson said: ""A request was received on 19 December 2023 from Sólás to address the council on the topic of disability community services and inclusion in south Belfast. ""No groups applying for the Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund were invited to address the council meeting about their application for funding."" Hearth said that if Riddel's Warehouse is fully restored it will bring jobs to the city, contribute to heritage-led regeneration and be environmentally friendly. Ms Latimer said: ""The most sustainable building is the building that's already there.""","['Listed buildings', 'Belfast', 'Belfast City Council']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2862/production/_132283301_warehousenmni1955.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6A66/production/_132283272_interior.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/106A6/production/_132283276_warehouse.jpg']","['By Mark Simpson', 'BBC News NI community correspondent']",UK,N.

The US comedian spent a few months based just outside Belfast, at the Culloden Hotel, last year. During his stay, he performed a number of gigs in the city - some of which were a surprise - at the Limelight venue and Lavery's bar. Lift is the second Netflix film to be shot in Northern Ireland following The School for Good and Evil in 2021. It was filmed in Harbour Studios and on location across Northern Ireland, with support from Northern Ireland Screen. Ulster University, Titanic Hotel, the Crown Liquor Saloon and Riddel's Warehouse in Belfast, Castle Ward near Strangford, Shackleton Barracks in Ballykelly, Ward Park in Bangor, Whitehead railway station and Ardglass harbour were among the locations used. Directed by F Gary Gray, Lift sees an international heist crew, led by Kevin Hart's character Cyrus Whitaker, try to take $500m (£393m) in gold from a passenger plane before it ends up in the wrong hands. Chief executive of Northern Ireland Screen Richard Williams said: ""The dedication and craftmanship of the local crew complemented the work of global players Kevin Hart and F Gary Gray to bring this eagerly anticipated film to life."" Last year the UK government said that screen productions in Northern Ireland have directly contributed more than £330m to the local economy since 2018. While filming in Belfast, Philadelphia native Hart did a number of comedy shows in venues around the city. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster Programme, local comedian Paddy McDonnell told the story of how this came about. ""I do know that he did think about doing a comedy set in Belfast because he had never done it and went down and watched comedy incognito and then [said], 'Maybe we'll approach these guys and do one without telling the audience' - and that's exactly what happened."" Hart made his surprise appearance in Lavery's on St Patrick's Day 2022 and went on to perform at other venues including the Limelight and the SSE arena. Mr Williams told the programme that the fact that Hart apparently had a good time while in Belfast would be good for Northern Ireland's entertainment industry. ""The development of a cultural scene, of a creative industry scene, is all about word of mouth. It's all about reputation: it's all about what people say about it.""","['Belfast', 'Kevin Hart']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A386/production/_116926814_gettyimages-1193044293.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8D6A/production/_127520263_belfastharbourstudios.jpg']",,UK,N.

But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty.

""Superhost"" Tracey Parsons, 55, had rented out the cottage, near Inverness, to a woman for 10 days last weekend. But on Tuesday, 14 puppies and a dog were discovered at the property which was covered in dog faeces and rubbish. ""I was absolutely stunned,"" Ms Parsons said. ""I couldn't believe it."" She said she and her partner David Bradley, 55, had been alerted by a neighbour who had seen what she believed to be an abandoned car containing puppies. On knocking at the cottage, she had been hit by a foul smell and dogs yapping. Mr Bradley attended the property where he found a couple outside waiting to buy a puppy. They told him they were paying £1,500 for it. They left after seeing photographs from inside. ""The woman who had rented the cottage wasn't going to let my partner in,"" Ms Parsons told BBC Scotland News. ""He was absolutely gobsmacked at what he saw."" Ms Parsons also went to the property where she said the found the inside of the cottage covered in dog faeces. ""It was right up the walls and bins were full of it,"" she said. ""It was also on the floor wrapped in kitchen roll and had blocked the toilet. ""The puppies were caked in it and they stank. ""The woman just let them poo and wee everywhere. She even managed to break the washing machine."" Ms Parsons said: ""It's just shocking. This is the Highlands. It's quiet. People don't do that here. ""We have rented out the cottage for a few years and it's always been left in an immaculate condition. We've never had any problems before."" She also said some of the puppies were in a cage which also contained metal lids from dog food cans. It is understood by BBC Scotland News that the puppy seller, who booked the cottage under the name Rachel Tidey but has sent emails to the BBC from Camille Harland, has now been suspended from Airbnb. She claimed some of the mess had been caused by the police allowing puppies to ""run loose for a few hours"". ""It was not all pre-existing damage,"" she said. ""I did offer to clean and pay for cleaning fees but the owners told me to leave. ""The puppies are all registered to me and were found to be healthy by the SSPCA and the police said there was no evidence of a crime being committed."" She added that the information about the couple waiting at the property to buy a puppy was not accurate as she did not usually charge that price for a puppy. Ms Parsons said there were two litters of puppies and that the Scottish SPCA estimated one of them to be five or six weeks weeks old and the other a few weeks older. ""When I rang Airbnb to tell them what had happened the man said 'but you're dog friendly',"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it."" The couple have spent two days having the cottage deep cleaned before being repainted. ""It will be a couple of weeks before we can have guests in again,"" Ms Parsons said. ""On the day, I felt like giving up. I just thought it's not worth the stress. ""It does put you off a bit and makes you more wary but we've now bought a security camera for the outside of the house. ""You just have to get on with it."" The couple called in the police and Scottish SPCA. The puppies were originally seized by the charity but were returned to the owner. Scottish SPCA inspector Andy Brown said the charity was called out to the cottage on Tuesday after receiving reports of puppies being left in a vehicle for days. ""When we attended there were no dogs in the vehicle,"" he said. ""A number of puppies were being kept in the property, along with their mum, and we had these animals checked over by a vet. ""The vet had no concerns over their health. We are continuing to work with the owner of these animals to ensure they are being appropriately cared for."" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""Officers attended along with a partner agency and carried out inquiries. No criminality was established, and no further police action was taken."" A spokesperson for Airbnb said: ""We were deeply saddened to hear about this and our specialist team is in touch with the host to provide support. ""We stand ready to assist both the police and Scottish SPCA with any investigation. Our dedicated law enforcement portal allows police forces to contact us with a suspected issue, while residents can use our Neighbourhood Support Line to report urgent concerns.""","['Animal welfare', 'Dogs', 'Airbnb', 'Animals', 'Inverness']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14DDC/production/_132286458_puppiestracey.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/74C0/production/_132288892_puppies11.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D6CC/production/_132288945_puppies13.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C2E0/production/_132288894_puppies10.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/124EC/production/_132288947_puppies9.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11100/production/_132288896_puppies8.jpg']","['By Catherine Lyst', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67957694,Poor Things: 'I don't mind they erased Glasgow from dad's book',The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend.,2024-01-12,"The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend. Based on a 1992 novel by Scots artist and writer Alasdair Gray, it's the fantastical tale of a woman who takes her own life and is revived by a Victorian surgeon who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos was blown away by the book which he first read in 2009. ""I completely fell in love with Bella Baxter - and it was obvious to me that somehow I had to bring her to life. ""I was surprised no one had made a film version."" In fact, there was a film version - written by Alasdair Gray and Sandy Johnson - just two years after the book was published. They envisaged a cast which included Robert Carlisle and Helena Bonham Carter but it was a project which didn't get off the ground. Lanthimos travelled to Glasgow in 2011 to meet Alasdair Gray, and was taken on a tour of the places mentioned in the book. A year later, Lanthimos acquired the film rights. A decade later, with a screenplay by Tony McNamara, the film began shooting on a set in Hungary, the Glasgow locations replaced with futuristic versions of Paris, Lisbon and London. It has led to a frenzied debate on social media about whether the loss of the location has lessened the film. But Alasdair Gray's son Andrew, who looks after the Gray estate, disagrees. He believes the production and its entire cast and crew treated the book with respect. ""When I met the cast, a lot of people had read the book so I was very impressed with that. ""My father didn't set any pre-conditions when he met Yorgos. The contract was drawn up, probably around 2012 and he was aware and in agreement with the circumstances of it. ""He wasn't a film director. He was happy for someone else to take on his work."" There's also more than a hint of Gray in the character of Baxter, played by Willem Dafoe. The Frankenstein patchwork of his face has echoes of Alasdair Gray's chiselled artwork and he uses the same gentle accent and singsong voice as Gray himself. ""I listened to tapes of Alasdair Gray,"" he said,"" and even though I wasn't trying to copy that accent I liked how he spoke and he had a wicked sense of humour and I think he put a lot of himself into the character of Baxter."" The film has been garnering awards since it first won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September. Last week it won two Golden Globes and is now being tipped for Bafta and Oscar success. ""It's very much like a fairy tale for me,"" says Andrew Gray, who's seen the film seven times, including a special screening at the Glasgow Film Theatre and another in his neighbourhood cinema in Connecticut where he's lived for the last 30 years. ""It's not often you get invited to red carpet events, I know the experience is temporary but it's been good fun."" Gray, who died in 2019 at the age of 85 was one of Scotland's greatest artists and writers. His first novel Lanark, published in 1981, is widely regarded as a landmark publication, responsible for a renaissance in Scottish writing. One of his artworks, in private hands since it was created in the 1950s, sold at auction last week for a record £42,700. Andrew Gray believes it's long overdue attention. ""I think Alasdair has been neglected over the years and I'm hoping this will being more international attention to his work,"" he said. ""The limelight that this film has shared onto his work is certainly going to promote his writing and his art. It's going to bring new readers back to the book."" And that's the hope they have at the National Library of Scotland which holds his literary archive. It includes handwritten notes, manuscripts, artworks and letters. There are three early versions of Poor Creatures, which would go on to become Poor Things. In the correspondence is a letter from Gray to Yorgos Lanthimos after his visit to Glasgow, wishing him the best for his film adaptation. Colin McIlroy, curator of modern literary manuscripts said: ""There are hundreds and hundreds of boxes. ""And it covers pretty much the working process for almost all of his written output: novels, short stories, dramas, radio adaptations, film scripts, diaries, and correspondence."" Some of the archive is available for consultation in the library's reading rooms but with 200 boxes, spanning a career of almost seven decades, the library is currently fundraising for a full time cataloguer. Chris Cassells, head of archives and manuscript collections at the library said: ""This is a collection of international significance - one of the biggest literary archives we have. ""We would very much hope that, given the amount of attention the film has received, given that it's really put Alasdair's name in the spotlight internationally, that people will watch the film before reading the book. ""And then they'll read other books and explore perhaps further into the hinterlands of Scottish literature.""","['Glasgow', 'Film', 'Literature']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17F1E/production/_132287089_poor2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/09E1/production/_132292520_poor.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A621/production/_132292524_961debfb11d4229fa7e8385e9fea8b0d00de70e2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5801/production/_132292522_willem.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11B51/production/_132292527_4f766def-54a3-4e0b-8306-3d8239f52c67.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3C9/production/_132292914_0ced4fed-a357-4985-8ab0-33d215f4f1fc.jpg']","['By Pauline McLean', 'BBC Scotland arts correspondent']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjlg32ngwrzo,A shift in tone as the SNP gears up for election,"When Rishi Sunak announced it was his “working assumption” that there would be a general election in the second half of this year, he effectively fired the campaign starting gun.",2024-01-12,"When Rishi Sunak announced it was his “working assumption” that there would be a general election in the second half of this year, he effectively fired the campaign starting gun.And Humza Yousaf has wasted no time in spelling out the message he wants to hammer home in the months ahead.He treated activists and sitting MPs and MSPs to a speech in Glasgow on Friday.But – given that he can already rely on their votes – they weren’t the intended audience. The SNP leader was pitching to those in Scotland who back the idea of independence, but are flirting with voting Labour to get Rishi Sunak out of Number 10.He essentially told them that they can have their cake and eat it at the next general election.His logic goes like this: Sir Keir Starmer has it in the bag. He will be Prime Minister. Labour’s UK-wide lead is so commanding that Scottish seats won’t swing the election.Therefore, he argues, independence supporters should back the SNP to keep independence on the agenda.Humza Yousaf wants to reassure them that they can have everything they want – an end to Conservative government, whilst keeping the prospect of independence alive and well.The independence part of that message is nothing new. Though there does appear to be a slight change in tone.There was a stark column from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard in recent days. Writing in the Sunday National, he warned “if the SNP lose the election in Scotland, the debate on independence stops”.It appears Humza Yousaf may have been reading at the weekend, because he seems to have adopted elements of this message.Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he said that a big Labour vote in Scotland would take the cause of independence “backwards”. I put it to Humza Yousaf that it sounds like he’s sending a warning to independence supporters. He insisted he isn’t.But he is keen to stress that he believes a lack of SNP MPs won’t just hurt his party, but the wider independence movement.Back at party conference last October, the first minister was keen to talk up the opportunities of SNP success for those who back independence.But it feels like the new year has marked a shift to talking about the pitfalls of an underwhelming performance.He told me any independence supporter “must vote for what you believe in”. In his mind, that’s a vote for the SNP.It’s important to note that other pro-independence parties, such as the Greens and Alba, are available. There’s logic behind his approach. Polls suggest the cause of independence is more popular than the SNP. Humza Yousaf believes tying the two together can improve his party’s chances.Though there are still those who question the specifics on how a large number of SNP MPs shifts the dial on independence in the years ahead. One party figure I spoke to was happy to see the party settle on a more straightforward campaign message. But they were also concerned that some voters unhappy with the SNP/Green government’s performance in Scotland might look to give the party a bloody nose at election time, even if they back independence.This is a theory shared by figures in Scottish Labour.They think that many Scots are underwhelmed by the day-to-day running of the country, and will look to punish the SNP the next time they go to the polls (even if it’s a vote for Westminster, not Holyrood).Scottish Labour also argue that electing their candidates gives Scottish MPs the chance to sit at the heart of the UK government. The Scottish Conservatives will be content with the ground on which Humza Yousaf hopes to fight the forthcoming election.If he wants to talk about independence, they’re more than happy to play ball and put forward the opposing side of the argument. Elections soak up a lot of a party leader’s time and energy. And Humza Yousaf already has plenty on his plate.He’s responsible for day-to-day government in Scotland. And SNP infighting is more public than at any time in recent political memory.But at least one of his jobs seems to be done – he’s settled on a campaign message. As ever, the key question is ‘will it work?’It’s easy to see the rationality behind the approach Humza Yousaf is taking. But you’re a brave person if you’re willing to predict the outcome of an election that may yet be the best part of a year away.","['Scottish government', 'SNP (Scottish National Party)', 'Labour Party', 'Scottish independence', 'Humza Yousaf']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/077a/live/44759a10-b172-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/dd15/live/a9460330-b172-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg']","['David Wallace Lockhart', 'BBC Scotland political correspondent', '@BBCDavidWL']",UK,Scotland

Cumming, who actually appeared in 1995 Bond film Goldeneye, says the  producers of the reality show wanted him to ""camp it up"" and host it as an over-the-top character.So he adopts an eccentric Scottish accent, quotes Shakespeare and pokes fun at the contestants - but Cumming says he is still heavily invested in the drama which he watches on live feeds in his dressing room.""I can see them. I do feel like a James Bond villain,"" he says while laughing and stroking an imaginary cat, mimicking one of 007's most famous adversaries Ernst Blofeld.In fact Cumming says that when he accepted the role, he suggested that he could bring his dog to stroke menacingly instead.The idea was not taken up for the first series because his dog Lala could not travel to Scotland for the filming. ""My dog's in the second one,"" Cumming says with a smile. Season two of the US version of The Traitors is currently airing, at the same time as the UK version - hosted by Claudia Winkleman on BBC One.Both are filmed at Ardross Castle in Easter Ross and involve ""faithful"" contestants trying to discover and eliminate the traitors in their midst.Cumming hosts the US version wearing increasingly flamboyant costumes, with accessories added as each episode progresses.He tells BBC Scotland's The Edit his exaggerated Scottish accent is ""me playing Moira Rose from Schitt's Creek playing Alan Cumming"". Cumming says the US version is also different because the contestants are all celebrities to some degree, generally reality TV stars. ""It heightens the drama, they understand how to do drama,"" he says. While UK viewers may not be familiar with many of the celebrities, there is one they might recognise.John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of the more surprising contestants in the US show. Cumming says: ""It was fascinating to see what the Americans made of him because none of them knew who he was.""They thought he talked too much, and he did.""However, Cumming says: ""In the end, he became a team player."" He says he loved teasing Bercow during the filming of the show. ""It's hilarious, I loved bossing him about,"" Cumming says. ""Any opportunity to go, 'order, order, John,'."" Cumming, from Aberfeldy in Perthshire, made his acting debut in the 1980s and is perhaps best remembered in Scotland for the comedy series The High Life which he created with Forbes Masson.In the decades since he has appeared in dozens of films including Spy Kids and X-Men 2 as well as having a starring role in the US TV series The Good Wife.Now 58, Cumming is thinking more about ageing and it is the focus of his new solo tour, set to begin later this month, called Alan Cumming is Not Acting His Age.He describes the show as akin to an old-fashioned cabaret, featuring a performance filled with music and discussions covering a range of topics such as sex, death, and alcohol. Cumming says there are under-discussed positives to getting older.""You get wiser, you don't worry so much,"" he says. ""Wisdom is about realising life is a cyclical thing, the same things keep coming around. ""It's the same show with different costumes."" Cumming says realising this enables better decision-making later in life and being open to the possibility of new experiences.""We worship at the altar of youth,"" he says.""I talk about this in the show, why have we decided that something that is inevitable, inexorable, like ageing is the worst possible thing in the world? ""We need to find beauty in not just youth.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cv2l1yjlew2o,Mother 'devastated' as 10-year inquiry delayed again,A woman who has waited nearly 10 years for the findings of a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into her son’s death has told the BBC she feels “let down and devastated” after it emerged there will be a further delay to its publication.,2024-01-12,"A woman who has waited nearly 10 years for the findings of a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into her son’s death has told the BBC she feels “let down and devastated” after it emerged there will be a further delay to its publication.  Warren Fenty, 20, from Aberdeen, died from a drugs overdose while in police custody in 2014. Sheriff Morag McLaughlin’s findings were due to be published this month, following a number of previous delays. But the Scottish Courts Service has confirmed that due to “personal health reasons” Sheriff McLaughlin can no longer produce the determination, and it will now be taken over by the Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Derek Pyle. Warren’s mother, Sharon Fenty, told BBC Scotland News:  “I just feel empty, let down and devastated. I can’t get my head around it.“I need answers, I’ve been waiting for answers for nearly ten years.“Does this mean that the whole thing will have to start again? I have so many questions. It feels like delay after delay.“There have been a lot of mistakes made. For the first couple of years or so it was just passed to the side. Then there was Covid. But I think it’s terrible that anyone has had to wait so long.”She added urgent changes were needed around the timings of FAIs to prevent other families going through the same experience. Mr Fenty died at Aberdeen’s Kittybrewster police station in June 2014. He had been arrested after discharging himself from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, against medical advice, and was being held in Kittybrewster’s custody suite. The inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently the longest ongoing FAI in Scotland. A Judicial Office spokesperson said: “Sheriff principal Pyle, the sheriff principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands, has been monitoring progress of the preparation of sheriff McLaughlin’s determination in this inquiry over an extended period. “The sheriff principal will now take personal control of the inquiry and has offered to meet the family of Warren Fenty, if they so wish, to discuss the delay and its consequences.”The statement added: “The sheriff principal recognises that this is a very unsatisfactory situation and this step has been taken with great reluctance, recognising the harm which the delay to date has already done but also what yet more uncertainty will do to the interests of all parties to the inquiry, not least the family of the deceased. “He will fix a hearing as a matter of urgency for the participants to be given the opportunity to discuss the best way forward. Whatever is decided, the inquiry will be under his sole control, including the preparation of the final determination.” A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “The procurator fiscal will continue to support and provide assistance to the fatal accident inquiry as required. “We will continue to keep the Fenty family updated on any significant developments in relation to the inquiry.” Ms Fenty said she hoped to meet with sheriff Pyle within the next two weeks. “I’ve sat for nearly ten years waiting and waiting to find out what happened to my son. That is a hole that will never fill,” she said.“I don’t want another mother waiting ten years to find out why their child is not here anymore. “","['Police Scotland', 'Justice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/840/cpsprodpb/8d86/live/d3df5dd0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/654/cpsprodpb/c633/live/ad665220-b178-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f405/live/4dce5b80-b17a-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0787/live/2d667bf0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/585/cpsprodpb/cee6/live/bfaf9090-b178-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg']","['Louise Hosie', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nyywen20po,Wrongly accused postmaster died before his name was cleared,,2024-01-12,"A sub-postmaster was haunted by feelings of shame and thought about taking his own life after being accused of stealing money from the Post Office, his widow has said.Dad-of-five Bill Quarm, who ran a post office in the Western Isles, pleaded guilty in 2010 to embezzling money to avoid going to prison.Mr Quarm, who suffered from ill-health, died in 2012 aged 69. His conviction was overturned last year.His widow, Anne, said the threat of jail had been devastating: ""The fear in his eyes - I’ll never forget it."" More than 900 Post Office workers were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches.Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office.The scandal affected up to 100 workers in Scotland, and Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has said he would work with the UK government to ensure victims across the UK were exonerated. The Quarms ran a bed and breakfast and a shop with a post office in Paible, North Uist.Mrs Quarm said the family's happy and busy life came to an end abruptly one night.She said: ""Bill came home looking like death and crying and saying 'I’ve had these guys in bullying me from the Post Office'.""Mr Quarm had been accused of stealing tens of thousands of pounds, and was warned Post Office staff would return within days seeking answers to where the money was.Mrs Quarm said: ""He said ‘Anne, I have no answers’. And he was crying on my shoulder.""I believed Bill.""He was an honourable man and a good husband and father and worked really hard. I had no reason to believe otherwise."" Mr Quarm was accompanied by his brother-in-law at his next meeting with the Post Office.His wife said her husband collapsed during an interview, but he continued to be questioned. His brother-in-law asked for the interview to be stopped so he could catch his breath and get his medication.Mrs Quarm said: ""Lots of things went on in that meeting that I still don’t know to this day because he wouldn’t let me hear how they treated him. ""It’s just painful."" The postmaster's biggest fear was he would be sent to jail, and Mrs Quarm said this led to him having suicidal thoughts.""Short of being a recluse he was distancing himself from the family because he was so depressed and ashamed that he had brought this shame on the home,"" she said.""They (the Post Office) were making him believe that he had brought this shame on us all and the only reason he pled guilty was to try and keep him out of prison and it was shocking. ""Every time he was getting ready for court he had to pack a wee bag because we never thought he would be back.""The fear in his eyes - I’ll never forget it.""Mr Quarm was ordered to carry out community service.Following a deterioration in his health, he died in 2012.

Warren Fenty, 20, from Aberdeen, died from a drugs overdose while in police custody in 2014. Sheriff Morag McLaughlin’s findings were due to be published this month, following a number of previous delays. But the Scottish Courts Service has confirmed that due to “personal health reasons” Sheriff McLaughlin can no longer produce the determination, and it will now be taken over by the Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Derek Pyle. Warren’s mother, Sharon Fenty, told BBC Scotland News:  “I just feel empty, let down and devastated. I can’t get my head around it.“I need answers, I’ve been waiting for answers for nearly ten years.“Does this mean that the whole thing will have to start again? I have so many questions. It feels like delay after delay.“There have been a lot of mistakes made. For the first couple of years or so it was just passed to the side. Then there was Covid. But I think it’s terrible that anyone has had to wait so long.”She added urgent changes were needed around the timings of FAIs to prevent other families going through the same experience. Mr Fenty died at Aberdeen’s Kittybrewster police station in June 2014. He had been arrested after discharging himself from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, against medical advice, and was being held in Kittybrewster’s custody suite. The inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently the longest ongoing FAI in Scotland. A Judicial Office spokesperson said: “Sheriff principal Pyle, the sheriff principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands, has been monitoring progress of the preparation of sheriff McLaughlin’s determination in this inquiry over an extended period. “The sheriff principal will now take personal control of the inquiry and has offered to meet the family of Warren Fenty, if they so wish, to discuss the delay and its consequences.”The statement added: “The sheriff principal recognises that this is a very unsatisfactory situation and this step has been taken with great reluctance, recognising the harm which the delay to date has already done but also what yet more uncertainty will do to the interests of all parties to the inquiry, not least the family of the deceased. “He will fix a hearing as a matter of urgency for the participants to be given the opportunity to discuss the best way forward. Whatever is decided, the inquiry will be under his sole control, including the preparation of the final determination.” A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “The procurator fiscal will continue to support and provide assistance to the fatal accident inquiry as required. “We will continue to keep the Fenty family updated on any significant developments in relation to the inquiry.” Ms Fenty said she hoped to meet with sheriff Pyle within the next two weeks. “I’ve sat for nearly ten years waiting and waiting to find out what happened to my son. That is a hole that will never fill,” she said.“I don’t want another mother waiting ten years to find out why their child is not here anymore. “","['Police Scotland', 'Justice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/840/cpsprodpb/8d86/live/d3df5dd0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/654/cpsprodpb/c633/live/ad665220-b178-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f405/live/4dce5b80-b17a-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0787/live/2d667bf0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/585/cpsprodpb/cee6/live/bfaf9090-b178-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg']","['Louise Hosie', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p1rdzyg6mo,We're playing shinty for the first time in our 80s,The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll.,2024-01-12,"The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll. But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty. ""The amazing work of Shinty Memories Scotland and their cluster groups in bringing together older people to engage in the sport is truly inspiring.""However, Laurene has gone one step further - amazing.""","['Elderly people', 'Lochgilphead', 'Mental health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/b6ad/live/ab7bc9f0-af38-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/945/cpsprodpb/1c13/live/091d63d0-afb0-11ee-b3f7-fd8c6292139d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/970/cpsprodpb/2200/live/cb0e62a0-b0b9-11ee-ad9c-fd8d022d1d63.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/694/cpsprodpb/653a/live/33b07e40-af3b-11ee-a916-3396d6d92381.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/836/cpsprodpb/fdb4/live/f0466e50-b0b9-11ee-a40e-199b105537bc.jpg']","['Andreas Wolff', 'BBC Naidheachdan']",UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdll0ypenlo,Alan Cumming: I feel like Bond villain in US Traitors,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"".",2024-01-12,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"". Cumming, who actually appeared in 1995 Bond film Goldeneye, says the  producers of the reality show wanted him to ""camp it up"" and host it as an over-the-top character.So he adopts an eccentric Scottish accent, quotes Shakespeare and pokes fun at the contestants - but Cumming says he is still heavily invested in the drama which he watches on live feeds in his dressing room.""I can see them. I do feel like a James Bond villain,"" he says while laughing and stroking an imaginary cat, mimicking one of 007's most famous adversaries Ernst Blofeld.In fact Cumming says that when he accepted the role, he suggested that he could bring his dog to stroke menacingly instead.The idea was not taken up for the first series because his dog Lala could not travel to Scotland for the filming. ""My dog's in the second one,"" Cumming says with a smile. Season two of the US version of The Traitors is currently airing, at the same time as the UK version - hosted by Claudia Winkleman on BBC One.Both are filmed at Ardross Castle in Easter Ross and involve ""faithful"" contestants trying to discover and eliminate the traitors in their midst.Cumming hosts the US version wearing increasingly flamboyant costumes, with accessories added as each episode progresses.He tells BBC Scotland's The Edit his exaggerated Scottish accent is ""me playing Moira Rose from Schitt's Creek playing Alan Cumming"". Cumming says the US version is also different because the contestants are all celebrities to some degree, generally reality TV stars. ""It heightens the drama, they understand how to do drama,"" he says. While UK viewers may not be familiar with many of the celebrities, there is one they might recognise.John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of the more surprising contestants in the US show. Cumming says: ""It was fascinating to see what the Americans made of him because none of them knew who he was.""They thought he talked too much, and he did.""However, Cumming says: ""In the end, he became a team player."" He says he loved teasing Bercow during the filming of the show. ""It's hilarious, I loved bossing him about,"" Cumming says. ""Any opportunity to go, 'order, order, John,'."" Cumming, from Aberfeldy in Perthshire, made his acting debut in the 1980s and is perhaps best remembered in Scotland for the comedy series The High Life which he created with Forbes Masson.In the decades since he has appeared in dozens of films including Spy Kids and X-Men 2 as well as having a starring role in the US TV series The Good Wife.Now 58, Cumming is thinking more about ageing and it is the focus of his new solo tour, set to begin later this month, called Alan Cumming is Not Acting His Age.He describes the show as akin to an old-fashioned cabaret, featuring a performance filled with music and discussions covering a range of topics such as sex, death, and alcohol. Cumming says there are under-discussed positives to getting older.""You get wiser, you don't worry so much,"" he says. ""Wisdom is about realising life is a cyclical thing, the same things keep coming around. ""It's the same show with different costumes."" Cumming says realising this enables better decision-making later in life and being open to the possibility of new experiences.""We worship at the altar of youth,"" he says.""I talk about this in the show, why have we decided that something that is inevitable, inexorable, like ageing is the worst possible thing in the world? ""We need to find beauty in not just youth.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67957694,Poor Things: 'I don't mind they erased Glasgow from dad's book',The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend.,2024-01-12,"The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend. Based on a 1992 novel by Scots artist and writer Alasdair Gray, it's the fantastical tale of a woman who takes her own life and is revived by a Victorian surgeon who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos was blown away by the book which he first read in 2009. ""I completely fell in love with Bella Baxter - and it was obvious to me that somehow I had to bring her to life. ""I was surprised no one had made a film version."" In fact, there was a film version - written by Alasdair Gray and Sandy Johnson - just two years after the book was published. They envisaged a cast which included Robert Carlisle and Helena Bonham Carter but it was a project which didn't get off the ground. Lanthimos travelled to Glasgow in 2011 to meet Alasdair Gray, and was taken on a tour of the places mentioned in the book. A year later, Lanthimos acquired the film rights. A decade later, with a screenplay by Tony McNamara, the film began shooting on a set in Hungary, the Glasgow locations replaced with futuristic versions of Paris, Lisbon and London. It has led to a frenzied debate on social media about whether the loss of the location has lessened the film. But Alasdair Gray's son Andrew, who looks after the Gray estate, disagrees. He believes the production and its entire cast and crew treated the book with respect. ""When I met the cast, a lot of people had read the book so I was very impressed with that. ""My father didn't set any pre-conditions when he met Yorgos. The contract was drawn up, probably around 2012 and he was aware and in agreement with the circumstances of it. ""He wasn't a film director. He was happy for someone else to take on his work."" There's also more than a hint of Gray in the character of Baxter, played by Willem Dafoe. The Frankenstein patchwork of his face has echoes of Alasdair Gray's chiselled artwork and he uses the same gentle accent and singsong voice as Gray himself. ""I listened to tapes of Alasdair Gray,"" he said,"" and even though I wasn't trying to copy that accent I liked how he spoke and he had a wicked sense of humour and I think he put a lot of himself into the character of Baxter."" The film has been garnering awards since it first won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September. Last week it won two Golden Globes and is now being tipped for Bafta and Oscar success. ""It's very much like a fairy tale for me,"" says Andrew Gray, who's seen the film seven times, including a special screening at the Glasgow Film Theatre and another in his neighbourhood cinema in Connecticut where he's lived for the last 30 years. ""It's not often you get invited to red carpet events, I know the experience is temporary but it's been good fun."" Gray, who died in 2019 at the age of 85 was one of Scotland's greatest artists and writers. His first novel Lanark, published in 1981, is widely regarded as a landmark publication, responsible for a renaissance in Scottish writing. One of his artworks, in private hands since it was created in the 1950s, sold at auction last week for a record £42,700. Andrew Gray believes it's long overdue attention. ""I think Alasdair has been neglected over the years and I'm hoping this will being more international attention to his work,"" he said. ""The limelight that this film has shared onto his work is certainly going to promote his writing and his art. It's going to bring new readers back to the book."" And that's the hope they have at the National Library of Scotland which holds his literary archive. It includes handwritten notes, manuscripts, artworks and letters. There are three early versions of Poor Creatures, which would go on to become Poor Things. In the correspondence is a letter from Gray to Yorgos Lanthimos after his visit to Glasgow, wishing him the best for his film adaptation. Colin McIlroy, curator of modern literary manuscripts said: ""There are hundreds and hundreds of boxes. ""And it covers pretty much the working process for almost all of his written output: novels, short stories, dramas, radio adaptations, film scripts, diaries, and correspondence."" Some of the archive is available for consultation in the library's reading rooms but with 200 boxes, spanning a career of almost seven decades, the library is currently fundraising for a full time cataloguer. Chris Cassells, head of archives and manuscript collections at the library said: ""This is a collection of international significance - one of the biggest literary archives we have. ""We would very much hope that, given the amount of attention the film has received, given that it's really put Alasdair's name in the spotlight internationally, that people will watch the film before reading the book.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdll0ypenlo,Alan Cumming: I feel like Bond villain in US Traitors,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"".",2024-01-12,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"". Cumming, who actually appeared in 1995 Bond film Goldeneye, says the  producers of the reality show wanted him to ""camp it up"" and host it as an over-the-top character.So he adopts an eccentric Scottish accent, quotes Shakespeare and pokes fun at the contestants - but Cumming says he is still heavily invested in the drama which he watches on live feeds in his dressing room.""I can see them. I do feel like a James Bond villain,"" he says while laughing and stroking an imaginary cat, mimicking one of 007's most famous adversaries Ernst Blofeld.In fact Cumming says that when he accepted the role, he suggested that he could bring his dog to stroke menacingly instead.The idea was not taken up for the first series because his dog Lala could not travel to Scotland for the filming. ""My dog's in the second one,"" Cumming says with a smile. Season two of the US version of The Traitors is currently airing, at the same time as the UK version - hosted by Claudia Winkleman on BBC One.Both are filmed at Ardross Castle in Easter Ross and involve ""faithful"" contestants trying to discover and eliminate the traitors in their midst.Cumming hosts the US version wearing increasingly flamboyant costumes, with accessories added as each episode progresses.He tells BBC Scotland's The Edit his exaggerated Scottish accent is ""me playing Moira Rose from Schitt's Creek playing Alan Cumming"". Cumming says the US version is also different because the contestants are all celebrities to some degree, generally reality TV stars. ""It heightens the drama, they understand how to do drama,"" he says. While UK viewers may not be familiar with many of the celebrities, there is one they might recognise.John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of the more surprising contestants in the US show. Cumming says: ""It was fascinating to see what the Americans made of him because none of them knew who he was.""They thought he talked too much, and he did.""However, Cumming says: ""In the end, he became a team player."" He says he loved teasing Bercow during the filming of the show. ""It's hilarious, I loved bossing him about,"" Cumming says. ""Any opportunity to go, 'order, order, John,'."" Cumming, from Aberfeldy in Perthshire, made his acting debut in the 1980s and is perhaps best remembered in Scotland for the comedy series The High Life which he created with Forbes Masson.In the decades since he has appeared in dozens of films including Spy Kids and X-Men 2 as well as having a starring role in the US TV series The Good Wife.Now 58, Cumming is thinking more about ageing and it is the focus of his new solo tour, set to begin later this month, called Alan Cumming is Not Acting His Age.He describes the show as akin to an old-fashioned cabaret, featuring a performance filled with music and discussions covering a range of topics such as sex, death, and alcohol. Cumming says there are under-discussed positives to getting older.""You get wiser, you don't worry so much,"" he says. ""Wisdom is about realising life is a cyclical thing, the same things keep coming around. ""It's the same show with different costumes."" Cumming says realising this enables better decision-making later in life and being open to the possibility of new experiences.""We worship at the altar of youth,"" he says.""I talk about this in the show, why have we decided that something that is inevitable, inexorable, like ageing is the worst possible thing in the world? ""We need to find beauty in not just youth.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p1rdzyg6mo,We're playing shinty for the first time in our 80s,The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll.,2024-01-12,"The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll. But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty. ""The amazing work of Shinty Memories Scotland and their cluster groups in bringing together older people to engage in the sport is truly inspiring.""However, Laurene has gone one step further - amazing.""","['Elderly people', 'Lochgilphead', 'Mental health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/b6ad/live/ab7bc9f0-af38-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/945/cpsprodpb/1c13/live/091d63d0-afb0-11ee-b3f7-fd8c6292139d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/970/cpsprodpb/2200/live/cb0e62a0-b0b9-11ee-ad9c-fd8d022d1d63.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/694/cpsprodpb/653a/live/33b07e40-af3b-11ee-a916-3396d6d92381.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/836/cpsprodpb/fdb4/live/f0466e50-b0b9-11ee-a40e-199b105537bc.jpg']","['Andreas Wolff', 'BBC Naidheachdan']",UK,Scotland

The MV Isle of Islay is then scheduled to arrive in Scotland in October this year and will serve Islay and Jura. The four ferries for CalMac routes are being built at the Cemre Marin Endustri shipyard in Yalovan. The work comes amidst continued frustration among island communities at the state of west coast services. Two late and over-budget ferries being built at the nationalised Ferguson Marine yard in Inverclyde, which were due to launch this spring, could face a further two-month delay. The Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa now have a price tag of at least £360m - compared to an initial estimate of £97m - for their construction at the yard in Port Glasgow. The Scottish Conservatives have described the potential delivery of Turkish-built vessels before those built on the Clyde as ""an astonishing humiliation for the SNP's original ferries strategy"". The Isle of Islay's Turkish-built sister ship, Loch Indaal, is estimated to be ready by February 2025. Both vessels will have capacity for up to 450 passengers and 100 cars. They will be followed by MV Claymore and MV Lochmor in June and October next year. Jim Anderson, director of vessels at CMAL, said the announcement of the Isle of Islay's launch in March marked a ""major milestone"" in its commitment to providing new ferries for islanders. He said: ""Work at the Cemre shipyard continues to progress well, with the project coming in on time and on budget."" Transport minister Fiona Hyslop said delivering six new vessels to serve Scotland's ferry network by 2026 was a priority for the Scottish government. She added: ""People will welcome a more resilient and modern ferry service for Islay and Jura, and further vessels will soon bring similar and highly-anticipated improvements for island communities across Scotland."" However, Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: ""While this is great news for islanders, it is an astonishing humiliation for the SNP's original ferries strategy, which still hasn't delivered two vessels that are six years late and hugely over budget. ""I predicted that when the Turkish shipyard was awarded the contract to build the ferries that they may well be ready before the ill-fated ones being built at the Ferguson yard. That is, sadly, turning out to be the case.""","['Ferries', 'Shipbuilding', 'Isle of Jura', 'CalMac', 'Isle of Islay']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A850/production/_132288034_mvisleofislay.jpg'],,UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67748637,I noticed a bulging lump sensation in my vagina,When Natashja Wilson first noticed she had symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse she had no idea what was happening and was too embarrassed to ask for help.,2024-01-12,"When Natashja Wilson first noticed she had symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse she had no idea what was happening and was too embarrassed to ask for help. Aged just 18 and living away from home at university, she had never heard of the condition which could affect up to 50% of women during their lifetime. ""I noticed when I went to the toilet a bulge was coming out of my vagina,"" she said. ""I was also experiencing incontinence and pain during intercourse and a bulging feeling. ""I didn't really know what to think because I honestly knew nothing about my body at that time."" Natashja, now 24, says she did not know what her pelvic floor or her cervix were at the time. ""So I asked my friends 'Is this bulging lump sensation normal?',"" she said. ""They said, 'Maybe it's your G-spot. Maybe it's just a spot'."" Natashja, from Greenwich in London, didn't know what to think so she left it and hoped it would go away with time. But her symptoms got worse and after 18 months she finally confided in her mum who persuaded her to see a doctor. It was later confirmed she had uterine prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the group of muscles and tissues that normally support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened and cannot hold the organs firmly in place. It causes one or more of the organs to move down from their normal position, leading to a bulge that can be felt inside or outside the vagina. This can be the womb, bowel, bladder or top of the vagina. Many women are unaware they have a prolapse or only have mild symptoms, but for some it can have a real impact on their quality of life. Symptoms can include a heavy dragging sensation or feeling of something coming down the vagina - which is sometimes described like a feeling of 'sitting on a tennis ball' as well as bladder and bowel issues and discomfort during sex. Pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help to improve symptoms, but sometimes medical treatment is needed such as vaginal pessaries or surgery. Causes of prolapse include genetics, heavy lifting, constipation or a persistent cough. Pregnancy and childbirth increase the risk of prolapse, particularly after a difficult labour. Women are also more likely to develop prolapse as they get older, especially after the menopause. But Natashja is keen to make people aware it can affect younger people too. She is trying to lift the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse through social media and her blog 'Living With Prolapse'. ""There's still so much stigma around prolapse, around discussing your genitalia and that doesn't allow for people to go see a doctor,"" she said. ""I know that if there was less stigma I would've gone to a doctor much earlier."" The stories of women hoping to left the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse. Watch now on BBC iPlayer According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) one in 12 women report symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse but on examination it is present in up to 50% of all women. Research yet to be published by Stirling University indicates that embarrassment, lack of awareness and a fear that symptoms won't be taken seriously, all act as barriers to women seeking help for pelvic health problems. The study looked at papers from 24 countries including the UK over the past 20 years, taking in the views of more than 20,000 women. Researchers Clare Jouanny and Dr Purva Abhyankar said: ""There is a large body of evidence from the UK and similar countries across the world that women still face many barriers when it comes to seeking help for women's health issues like prolapse. ""We need to focus not only on increasing awareness and education among women and clinicians, but more importantly we need to work with clinicians to change women's perception that clinicians don't take them seriously with pelvic health symptoms."" Pelvic health physiotherapist Suzanne Vernazza is on a mission to educate women about their pelvic health. She is the founder of the not-for-profit company Know Your Floors and her daily 'SqueezeAlong' pelvic floor exercise tutorials have more than 600,000 followers on TikTok. She says it is important for people to raise pelvic health concerns with their GP. ""If you've been feeling something that at any point doesn't feel quite right, whether you're pregnant or postnatal, raise it and ask the question because more than likely, you're right that it's not right - and you can have support for you to be able to manage that,"" she said. The Royal College of GPs said its doctors are well trained to diagnose and care for people affected by prolapse. RCGP Scotland deputy chairman Dr Chris Williams said: ""GPs are aware of the embarrassment or stigma that can be associated with this condition and strive to ensure women feel comfortable and empowered to seek support if experiencing symptoms."" Sam Hindle experienced bladder prolapse after the birth of her son 24 years ago and has been incontinent ever since. ""It was that bad that my two-year-old son was having to go and fetch mummy clean pants, clean trousers,"" she said.  ""It was embarrassing to have your two-year-old run about and say ' Oh Mummy's had an accident, I need to help'.'"" The 47-year-old, from Edinburgh, was one of tens of thousands of women in the UK to have transvaginal mesh surgery to treat prolapse and incontinence. Its use was halted in the UK in 2018 due to the life-changing side-effects many women suffered. Sam said she had been left in constant pain and suffers from PTSD as a result of the procedure. She hopes to have her mesh removed by a specialist in the United States and is currently on a waiting list for assessment in Glasgow. She said it was important for people to talk about pelvic health. ""Just like menopause, it's a subject that we need to remove the stigma of and talk about and let people not feel embarrassed about this so they will go and seek help,"" she said. ""You look at other females in the family who are having children and you think, 'Oh I'd better warn them, I better make sure they know about pelvic floor exercises and they know how to avoid possibly getting into the mess I did with bladder prolapse."" Natashja said prolapse affects women of all ages and it does not discriminate. ""I noticed my symptoms when I was 18 and when I went on Google it was only telling me that elderly women were impacted,"" she said. ""The doctors were so shocked that someone of my age had prolapse and it made me feel very isolated."" Natashja said she is now feeling positive about the future. She has been working with a pelvic health physiotherapist and uses a vaginal pessary, a device that helps to support the vaginal walls and pelvic organs, which means she feels more confident doing exercise. She said the support and advice of the online community had also helped her to cope. ""If you have just been diagnosed with prolapse, it's important to know you do not have to go through this alone,"" she said. ""There is an army of women out there willing to support you and help you through your journey and they can understand what you're going through and help you through it.""","['Health', ""Women's health"", 'Women']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0B2E/production/_132126820_female_anatomy_2x_640-nc-002.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0253/production/_124659500_generic_banner_top.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/105E8/production/_132084076_index_promo_prolapse.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2BC/production/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15020/production/_132084068_suzannepic1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/69A8/production/_132084072_sampic.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0030/production/_132084000_natasha2.jpg']","['By Hayley Jarvis', 'BBC Scotland reporter']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-67934473,The fight for the future of Rosefield Mills in Dumfries,The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon.,2024-01-12,"The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon. It was bought - to save it from total dereliction - by Dumfries Historic Buildings Trust (DHBT) in 2018. Since then, the group has been working at bringing parts of it back into use while looking at what the long-term future might hold. After more than five years - and a global pandemic - what stage has the project now reached? Richard Polley volunteers with the DHBT and said he was in no doubt that the property had been worth saving. ""I think it's an incredibly beautiful building,"" he said. ""The design is based on that of a Venetian palace - so I kind of now think of Dumfries as being the Venice of south-west Scotland. ""It's a huge building and was once one of five mills that were along the river in this part of Dumfries and this is now the only remaining part of that story."" He said it was designed to look beautiful on the river front but utilitarian behind that frontage. ""I think it's just so important not to lose that story of the mills in Dumfries that were a significant part of the prosperity of Dumfries and, of course, generated loads of employment here in the town,"" he said. ""This part of Dumfries would have been a real industrial centre and there's the potential to enliven it and to people it and make it part of the regeneration of Dumfries."" However, he admitted that it would take ""several million pounds"" to bring it back into full use but said the DHBT had plans for bringing it back into operation a little at a time. ""It's no good having a fancy scheme that costs so much to maintain and to operate - it has to be something that's sustainable,"" he explained. Luke Moloney, who chairs the trust, said they had made progress since buying the building, having gained support from a range of organisations. A workshop has been brought into use at the back of the building and two new spaces are now open for community or commercial uses. He accepts, however, that there is much more to be done. ""The building is colossal, I mean, it's 60 yards long and it's 12 yards deep - that's just the building on the river front and it's on two floors,"" he said. ""We've also got a similar-sized building on a single storey only running towards the back of the site. ""It's a huge amount of floor area and so that suggests a good mix of uses."" He said there were some ""wonderful"" and ""quite wacky"" ideas for its use that came out of community sessions and they were now examining the options. Among them might be an arts or archive centre. The idea of putting in a restaurant ""spilling out onto the river front"" is one that could have a key part to play. ""It would populate that space which could be a wonderful public space between the building and the water,"" he said. ""I think whatever happens that would be a necessary anchor."" Another option would be the potential for a cinema screen, studios and an exhibition or events space. ""There are lots of really good ideas and lots of interesting thoughts about it, which still need to be developed,"" said Mr Moloney. It all, of course, hinges on funding. ""I think we'd all like to think that in 10 years' time this building will be saved and in a mix of exciting uses,"" he said. ""But in terms of getting to the point where we have the money together and we know exactly what that mix will be I think we're looking optimistically at about a three-year process."" That would see a full-time development officer and support staff appointed to devote themselves to pulling the scheme together and attracting more support. In the shorter term, they have two projects taking place. On Friday evening, a Midwinter Light event will see lights switched on to illuminate the front of the building. Then, on Saturday, the public is invited to an open day between 11:00 and 15:00 to meet the group and share ideas of how to ensure Rosefield Mills flourishes. ""The river frontage is incredibly beautiful and everyone says we can't lose this, it's such a beautiful building,"" said Mr Moloney. ""I think there's a lot of affection for the building among the people of Dumfries, but also people who visit the town. ""We haven't given up yet, we're committed to finding a solution.""","['Architecture', 'Dumfries']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F61/production/_132275858_rosefieldmills.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17671/production/_132275859_richardpolley.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1AC9/production/_132275860_frontage.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/41D9/production/_132275861_lukemoloney.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/68E9/production/_132275862_riverside.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B709/production/_132275864_img_20180624_102408425.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6317/production/_132276352_rosefieldmllsbuilding.jpg']","['By Giancarlo Rinaldi', 'South Scotland reporter, BBC Scotland news website']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67951158,Why parents are reliving their baby-loss nightmares,"A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) got under way this week into the deaths of three babies, all less than a day old, in Lanarkshire.",2024-01-12,"A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) got under way this week into the deaths of three babies, all less than a day old, in Lanarkshire. The death of a baby is an event no parent should endure, let alone in circumstances where - if there were different decisions, procedures, or knowledge - that baby may have survived. To then have the details of that personal tragedy made public is further trauma that no family would want. Mirabelle Bosch died at just 12 hours old on 2 July 2021 at Wishaw General Hospital. Ellie McCormick died at five hours old on 5 March 2019 at the same hospital. And Leo Lamont was two hours old when he died at Monklands Hospital on 15 February 2019. It is important that these deaths are not brushed off as isolated tragedies, and if there are common failings then they should be investigated to prevent anything like this from happening again. That is why three families who were anticipating a joyous turn in their lives are putting themselves through the distress of reliving their worst nightmare. This FAI was called by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service which has deemed it in the public interest for this inquiry to take place. Mirabelle, Leo and Ellie were all said to have died ""in circumstances giving rise to serious public concern"". The purpose of this FAI is not to apportion blame, but to establish what happened and prevent future deaths from happening in similar circumstances. A sheriff will hear evidence, and eventually issue a determination of their findings which can include recommendations. Sheriff Principle Aisha Anwar, who is leading this inquiry, is sensitive to the immense trauma suffered by each family. While there is no way to avoid the distressing detail of what happened, much of their evidence has been submitted as written affidavits to save them the ordeal of being questioned on it in court. All the parents were in court on the first day of the inquiry, but none have been there since. Although very little is known at this stage, it is clear that a key question families want answered is how and whether potential procedural or system errors contributed to their babies deaths. The inquiry is set out in three chapters, firstly looking at the circumstances around Mirabelle Bosch's death. Her father Eckhardt, told the inquiry they were ""led into a dark tunnel"" by ""misguided"" instructions which gave them a ""wrong sense of security"". They had believed everything with the pregnancy was normal, with antenatal checks suggesting the baby was healthy and developing as it should. But the court heard that despite a 31-week scan recording the baby as completely breech, three subsequent midwife examinations recorded it as being in a head down, cephalic position. This is the position that typically allows for the smoothest delivery. Even when Rozelle Bosch's waters broke suddenly on 30 June 2021 and she was examined in hospital, the midwife sent her home to wait for labour to advance. Mirabelle was considered a ""low-risk"" pregnancy and midwife Michelle Tannahill told the inquiry this week she saw ""no red flags"" upon her examination. ""Everything I had found that night was within the scope of my practice within midwifery. There wasn't anything concerning,"" she said. The details of what happened next are extremely distressing. Husband Eckhardt Bosch said he still feels the trauma in his body over the night of 1 July. After going into active labour at home, paramedics were called but a catalogue of delays ensued. It took five attempts to call the maternity unit at Wishaw General Hospital before anybody answered the phone, and paramedics were unable to deliver the baby themselves. Mirabelle's head was stuck and by the time mother and baby were taken to hospital, her chances of survival were very slim. She died hours later in her mother's arms. The post-mortem later noted that if the breech position had been recognised earlier in the pregnancy, then Rozelle would have likely been classified as a higher risk where a management plan for a hospital birth would have been arranged and the outcome may have been different. The pathologist also concluded if there had not been such a long delays transporting the patient to hospital, she may also have stood a chance of survival. Evidence has been heard from health professionals involved in Mirabelle's death, with expert witnesses who were not directly involved in the case to follow. The FAI will then examine the deaths of Ellie McCormick and Leo Lamont. At this point there is no indication that health professionals in Mirabelle's case had not followed the protocols or procedures in place at the time. However, there have been questions about whether software used to record details of the pregnancy may not have alerted those involved of potential risks, or may have some limitations in the information it can hold. Issues around the subjectivity of deciding whether a baby is engaged in early pregnancy, and how clear instructions are to mothers on when they come into hospital, have also been discussed. These areas are likely to be explored further when the inquiry examines the circumstances around the deaths of Leo and Ellie. Speaking to BBC Scotland News, the McCormick family lawyer said they believe Ellie's death was entirely avoidable. Darren Deery, a specialist in medical negligence law, said: ""The family's understanding is that there were potential defects in the system, in that certain risk factors weren't highlighted in the way they could, and should, have been. ""And had the subsequent midwifery and obstetrics staff been aware of those risks, a different course of action would have been taken and the outcome may well have been different."" Ultimately there will be no blame placed here, but it will look in detail at what happened in each case, considering whether systems were at fault, whether individual or collective errors were involved and it will establish what steps, if any, might be taken to prevent other children dying in similar circumstances.","['NHS Lanarkshire', 'Wishaw', 'Pregnancy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15301/production/_132258768_gettyimages-640974708.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9399/production/_132258773_spin-babiesfaiglasgowsheriff-002.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D49C/production/_132282445_faibabyrantwithdepartures.1_frame_1057.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1BC2/production/_132260170_faibabydeathlawyer_frame_3989.jpg']","['By Lisa Summers', 'Scotland Health Correspondent']",UK,Scotland

Based on a 1992 novel by Scots artist and writer Alasdair Gray, it's the fantastical tale of a woman who takes her own life and is revived by a Victorian surgeon who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos was blown away by the book which he first read in 2009. ""I completely fell in love with Bella Baxter - and it was obvious to me that somehow I had to bring her to life. ""I was surprised no one had made a film version."" In fact, there was a film version - written by Alasdair Gray and Sandy Johnson - just two years after the book was published. They envisaged a cast which included Robert Carlisle and Helena Bonham Carter but it was a project which didn't get off the ground. Lanthimos travelled to Glasgow in 2011 to meet Alasdair Gray, and was taken on a tour of the places mentioned in the book. A year later, Lanthimos acquired the film rights. A decade later, with a screenplay by Tony McNamara, the film began shooting on a set in Hungary, the Glasgow locations replaced with futuristic versions of Paris, Lisbon and London. It has led to a frenzied debate on social media about whether the loss of the location has lessened the film. But Alasdair Gray's son Andrew, who looks after the Gray estate, disagrees. He believes the production and its entire cast and crew treated the book with respect. ""When I met the cast, a lot of people had read the book so I was very impressed with that. ""My father didn't set any pre-conditions when he met Yorgos. The contract was drawn up, probably around 2012 and he was aware and in agreement with the circumstances of it. ""He wasn't a film director. He was happy for someone else to take on his work."" There's also more than a hint of Gray in the character of Baxter, played by Willem Dafoe. The Frankenstein patchwork of his face has echoes of Alasdair Gray's chiselled artwork and he uses the same gentle accent and singsong voice as Gray himself. ""I listened to tapes of Alasdair Gray,"" he said,"" and even though I wasn't trying to copy that accent I liked how he spoke and he had a wicked sense of humour and I think he put a lot of himself into the character of Baxter."" The film has been garnering awards since it first won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September. Last week it won two Golden Globes and is now being tipped for Bafta and Oscar success. ""It's very much like a fairy tale for me,"" says Andrew Gray, who's seen the film seven times, including a special screening at the Glasgow Film Theatre and another in his neighbourhood cinema in Connecticut where he's lived for the last 30 years. ""It's not often you get invited to red carpet events, I know the experience is temporary but it's been good fun."" Gray, who died in 2019 at the age of 85 was one of Scotland's greatest artists and writers. His first novel Lanark, published in 1981, is widely regarded as a landmark publication, responsible for a renaissance in Scottish writing. One of his artworks, in private hands since it was created in the 1950s, sold at auction last week for a record £42,700. Andrew Gray believes it's long overdue attention. ""I think Alasdair has been neglected over the years and I'm hoping this will being more international attention to his work,"" he said. ""The limelight that this film has shared onto his work is certainly going to promote his writing and his art. It's going to bring new readers back to the book."" And that's the hope they have at the National Library of Scotland which holds his literary archive. It includes handwritten notes, manuscripts, artworks and letters. There are three early versions of Poor Creatures, which would go on to become Poor Things. In the correspondence is a letter from Gray to Yorgos Lanthimos after his visit to Glasgow, wishing him the best for his film adaptation. Colin McIlroy, curator of modern literary manuscripts said: ""There are hundreds and hundreds of boxes. ""And it covers pretty much the working process for almost all of his written output: novels, short stories, dramas, radio adaptations, film scripts, diaries, and correspondence."" Some of the archive is available for consultation in the library's reading rooms but with 200 boxes, spanning a career of almost seven decades, the library is currently fundraising for a full time cataloguer. Chris Cassells, head of archives and manuscript collections at the library said: ""This is a collection of international significance - one of the biggest literary archives we have. ""We would very much hope that, given the amount of attention the film has received, given that it's really put Alasdair's name in the spotlight internationally, that people will watch the film before reading the book. ""And then they'll read other books and explore perhaps further into the hinterlands of Scottish literature.""","['Glasgow', 'Film', 'Literature']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17F1E/production/_132287089_poor2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/09E1/production/_132292520_poor.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A621/production/_132292524_961debfb11d4229fa7e8385e9fea8b0d00de70e2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5801/production/_132292522_willem.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11B51/production/_132292527_4f766def-54a3-4e0b-8306-3d8239f52c67.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3C9/production/_132292914_0ced4fed-a357-4985-8ab0-33d215f4f1fc.jpg']","['By Pauline McLean', 'BBC Scotland arts correspondent']",UK,Scotland

""Superhost"" Tracey Parsons, 55, had rented out the cottage, near Inverness, to a woman for 10 days last weekend. But on Tuesday, 14 puppies and a dog were discovered at the property which was covered in dog faeces and rubbish. ""I was absolutely stunned,"" Ms Parsons said. ""I couldn't believe it."" She said she and her partner David Bradley, 55, had been alerted by a neighbour who had seen what she believed to be an abandoned car containing puppies. On knocking at the cottage, she had been hit by a foul smell and dogs yapping. Mr Bradley attended the property where he found a couple outside waiting to buy a puppy. They told him they were paying £1,500 for it. They left after seeing photographs from inside. ""The woman who had rented the cottage wasn't going to let my partner in,"" Ms Parsons told BBC Scotland News. ""He was absolutely gobsmacked at what he saw."" Ms Parsons also went to the property where she said the found the inside of the cottage covered in dog faeces. ""It was right up the walls and bins were full of it,"" she said. ""It was also on the floor wrapped in kitchen roll and had blocked the toilet. ""The puppies were caked in it and they stank. ""The woman just let them poo and wee everywhere. She even managed to break the washing machine."" Ms Parsons said: ""It's just shocking. This is the Highlands. It's quiet. People don't do that here. ""We have rented out the cottage for a few years and it's always been left in an immaculate condition. We've never had any problems before."" She also said some of the puppies were in a cage which also contained metal lids from dog food cans. It is understood by BBC Scotland News that the puppy seller, who booked the cottage under the name Rachel Tidey but has sent emails to the BBC from Camille Harland, has now been suspended from Airbnb. She claimed some of the mess had been caused by the police allowing puppies to ""run loose for a few hours"". ""It was not all pre-existing damage,"" she said. ""I did offer to clean and pay for cleaning fees but the owners told me to leave. ""The puppies are all registered to me and were found to be healthy by the SSPCA and the police said there was no evidence of a crime being committed."" She added that the information about the couple waiting at the property to buy a puppy was not accurate as she did not usually charge that price for a puppy. Ms Parsons said there were two litters of puppies and that the Scottish SPCA estimated one of them to be five or six weeks weeks old and the other a few weeks older. ""When I rang Airbnb to tell them what had happened the man said 'but you're dog friendly',"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it."" The couple have spent two days having the cottage deep cleaned before being repainted. ""It will be a couple of weeks before we can have guests in again,"" Ms Parsons said. ""On the day, I felt like giving up. I just thought it's not worth the stress. ""It does put you off a bit and makes you more wary but we've now bought a security camera for the outside of the house. ""You just have to get on with it."" The couple called in the police and Scottish SPCA. The puppies were originally seized by the charity but were returned to the owner. Scottish SPCA inspector Andy Brown said the charity was called out to the cottage on Tuesday after receiving reports of puppies being left in a vehicle for days. ""When we attended there were no dogs in the vehicle,"" he said. ""A number of puppies were being kept in the property, along with their mum, and we had these animals checked over by a vet. ""The vet had no concerns over their health. We are continuing to work with the owner of these animals to ensure they are being appropriately cared for."" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""Officers attended along with a partner agency and carried out inquiries. No criminality was established, and no further police action was taken."" A spokesperson for Airbnb said: ""We were deeply saddened to hear about this and our specialist team is in touch with the host to provide support. ""We stand ready to assist both the police and Scottish SPCA with any investigation. Our dedicated law enforcement portal allows police forces to contact us with a suspected issue, while residents can use our Neighbourhood Support Line to report urgent concerns.""","['Animal welfare', 'Dogs', 'Airbnb', 'Animals', 'Inverness']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14DDC/production/_132286458_puppiestracey.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/74C0/production/_132288892_puppies11.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D6CC/production/_132288945_puppies13.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C2E0/production/_132288894_puppies10.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/124EC/production/_132288947_puppies9.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11100/production/_132288896_puppies8.jpg']","['By Catherine Lyst', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p119e02v9o,'Confusing' bus gates concerning city shop owners,,2024-01-12,"Restricting some roads in Aberdeen to buses is driving customers away from city centre businesses, according to some businesses. The concerns follow this month's closure of Haigs Food Hall in Schoolhill which had operated for 12 years. The bus priority routes in the city centre were implemented in August last year. Council co-leader Ian Yuill said footfall was recovering and bus passenger numbers had increased. The restrictions, called bus gates, were introduced to reduce the amount of general traffic on Market Street, Guild Street, Union Street and Bridge Street.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) described the measures as a ""challenge"" for those wanting to come into the city centre. Jamie Stewart, the owner of Belmont Street gift shop Juniper, said customer numbers over Christmas and early 2024 were lower than the previous year when they were still feeling the impact of the pandemic. He said customers from the outskirts of the city or Aberdeenshire were being put off by the ""confusing"" bus measures. He said: ""Bus gates seem to be the main issue, it's a fear factor. ""Where do you go? What do you do?""I just don't think our city centre is built in a way that it really works. ""There's a lot less cars in the car parks, and that doesn't mean more people are getting the bus."" Mr Stewart said the closure of smaller shops like Haigs and larger stores such as John Lewis was concerning. He said what pulled people into the city centre were shops, adding: ""You need lots of different shops."" Mike Duncan, FSB north-east development manager, said the restrictions went against the aim of attracting people to the city centre. He said: ""That's what small businesses are concerned about, it is easier to do something else rather than come to Aberdeen city centre. ""The council has a lot of work to do.""He added high business rates and energy costs were putting a strain on businesses. Council co-leader, Liberal Democrat Ian Yuill, said he will meet with the FSB to discuss their concerns but admitted it was too early to make a decision on bus gates. He added: ""What is quite clear is the reliability of bus services has improved and the number of passengers has increased. ""But as you know, Aberdeen City Council like others in Scotland does not set business rates.""","['Aberdeen', 'Federation of Small Businesses (Scotland)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/2efb/live/74dbcdd0-b156-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/925/cpsprodpb/ffaf/live/09046500-b15a-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/b7fc/live/2c097600-b158-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg']","['Robbie Boyle', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland

The first tribunal ruled Sheriff Jack Brown's conduct toward a woman known as X was ""entirely inappropriate"" but did not justify his removal from office. X said evidence from two women making similar claims should have been heard. Mr Brown has been suspended on full pay since the allegations came to light in 2018. Judge Lord Woolman said the original tribunal had proceeded in ""ignorance of the availability of other evidence"". The new tribunal was constituted in 2022 by then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the request of the Lord President. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""Sheriff Jack Brown is subject to ongoing Fitness for Judicial Office Tribunal proceedings. ""Once the tribunal has made its decision, ministers will lay the tribunal's report before the Scottish Parliament in line with duties set out in the Court Reform (Scotland) Act 2014."" X, who is a lawyer, had raised judicial review proceedings to quash the decision of the original fitness for office tribunal, which was the first of its kind to be carried out in Scotland. The fitness for judicial office tribunal issued its decision in March 2021. It found that Mr Brown's behaviour had been ""entirely inappropriate"" and that he had ""failed to respect proper professional boundaries"". X had alleged inappropriate and unwelcome physical contact towards her, including a claim that he touched her bottom. The tribunal upheld one allegation, that Mr Brown had hugged X and made a remark towards her. But it said the other allegations had not been established on the balance of probabilities. Mr Brown was arrested and charged in relation to the allegations in January 2019, but prosecutors dropped the case three months later. He was appointed to the sheriffdom of Aberdeen in 2016. Mr Brown set up his own legal practice in Dundee in 1996, and has been a sheriff since 2005. An order granting his anonymity in the judicial review hearing was lifted following a successful challenge by BBC Scotland. During the judicial review hearing, X's legal team said there was a ""real possibility"" that the tribunal's decision would have been different if the other women's evidence had been made available to it. Mr Brown's lawyer argued that X's petition was ""no more than an invitation to the court to allow the petitioner to 'have another go' on the entirely speculative basis that a different outcome might be possible"".","['Aberdeen', 'Dundee']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/19C4/production/_132269560_20181112_sheriff_jack_brown_001.jpg'],"['By Graeme Ogston', 'BBC Scotland Tayside and Central reporter']",UK,Scotland

But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty.

Yampil, a 12-year-old Asiatic black bear, was one of the few animals to survive the attack in the Donetsk region. Named after the village where he was found, rescuers initially moved him to an animal sanctuary in Belgium. He has now been permanently rehomed to the Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian. Zoo staff told BBC Scotland News that the bear seemed ""relaxed"" despite the 690-mile trip, and was already enjoying snacking on his favourite food of cucumbers soon after arrival. However he will be closely watched to see if he exhibits any issues similar to post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) after being in a warzone. Yampil was concussed by shellfire when he was discovered in eastern Ukraine in October 2022. Most of the other 200 animals at the zoo had been killed during fierce fighting in the area. He was taken through Poland to the Natuurhulpcentrum animal sanctuary in Belgium, but now has a permanent home in West Calder. Zoo staff are now optimistic the animal will be on the road to recovery, after what they described as a ""fairly complicated"" journey to Scotland, which saw him travel overnight from Dover. Adam Welsh, the zoo's head of education, told the BBC: ""Yampil has been through a lot. He could have arrived and been incredibly nervous about meeting people. We wanted to make sure we were very delicate when he arrived, so there was no loud noises. He's experienced some really horrible things. ""Time will tell, but he seems remarkably calm, remarkably chilled out and he's been eating already. He's come out his crate, he's been eating, drinking and relaxing - that's nice to see and we're really hoping that continues."" Mr Welsh added that he was relieved that bringing Yampil north of the border had progressed smoothly. Brian Curran, owner of Five Sisters Zoo, previously stated that zoo staff's ""hearts broke"" when they first saw the bear, which was concussed after a shell had landed near him. Yampil will stay in a temporary enclosure while staff watch to see if he enters torpor - a state similar to hibernation over the winter. The zoo has been fundraising to cover the £200,000 cost of a new enclosure for Yampil, and have raised around £60,000 of their target so far. The Asiatic black bear - also known as moon bears because of crescent-shaped yellow fur on their chests -  are classed as a vulnerable species by conservation groups, with estimates suggesting there are fewer than 60,000 of them left in the world.","['West Calder', 'Animals', 'Bears', 'War in Ukraine']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/621F/production/_132291152_bear2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B962/production/_132285474_bear.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EA0/production/_132282102_yampilrescue.jpg']",,UK,Scotland

The MV Isle of Islay is then scheduled to arrive in Scotland in October this year and will serve Islay and Jura. The four ferries for CalMac routes are being built at the Cemre Marin Endustri shipyard in Yalovan. The work comes amidst continued frustration among island communities at the state of west coast services. Two late and over-budget ferries being built at the nationalised Ferguson Marine yard in Inverclyde, which were due to launch this spring, could face a further two-month delay. The Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa now have a price tag of at least £360m - compared to an initial estimate of £97m - for their construction at the yard in Port Glasgow. The Scottish Conservatives have described the potential delivery of Turkish-built vessels before those built on the Clyde as ""an astonishing humiliation for the SNP's original ferries strategy"". The Isle of Islay's Turkish-built sister ship, Loch Indaal, is estimated to be ready by February 2025. Both vessels will have capacity for up to 450 passengers and 100 cars. They will be followed by MV Claymore and MV Lochmor in June and October next year. Jim Anderson, director of vessels at CMAL, said the announcement of the Isle of Islay's launch in March marked a ""major milestone"" in its commitment to providing new ferries for islanders. He said: ""Work at the Cemre shipyard continues to progress well, with the project coming in on time and on budget."" Transport minister Fiona Hyslop said delivering six new vessels to serve Scotland's ferry network by 2026 was a priority for the Scottish government. She added: ""People will welcome a more resilient and modern ferry service for Islay and Jura, and further vessels will soon bring similar and highly-anticipated improvements for island communities across Scotland."" However, Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: ""While this is great news for islanders, it is an astonishing humiliation for the SNP's original ferries strategy, which still hasn't delivered two vessels that are six years late and hugely over budget. ""I predicted that when the Turkish shipyard was awarded the contract to build the ferries that they may well be ready before the ill-fated ones being built at the Ferguson yard.

Warren Fenty, 20, from Aberdeen, died from a drugs overdose while in police custody in 2014. Sheriff Morag McLaughlin’s findings were due to be published this month, following a number of previous delays. But the Scottish Courts Service has confirmed that due to “personal health reasons” Sheriff McLaughlin can no longer produce the determination, and it will now be taken over by the Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Derek Pyle. Warren’s mother, Sharon Fenty, told BBC Scotland News:  “I just feel empty, let down and devastated. I can’t get my head around it.“I need answers, I’ve been waiting for answers for nearly ten years.“Does this mean that the whole thing will have to start again? I have so many questions. It feels like delay after delay.“There have been a lot of mistakes made. For the first couple of years or so it was just passed to the side. Then there was Covid. But I think it’s terrible that anyone has had to wait so long.”She added urgent changes were needed around the timings of FAIs to prevent other families going through the same experience. Mr Fenty died at Aberdeen’s Kittybrewster police station in June 2014. He had been arrested after discharging himself from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, against medical advice, and was being held in Kittybrewster’s custody suite. The inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently the longest ongoing FAI in Scotland. A Judicial Office spokesperson said: “Sheriff principal Pyle, the sheriff principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands, has been monitoring progress of the preparation of sheriff McLaughlin’s determination in this inquiry over an extended period. “The sheriff principal will now take personal control of the inquiry and has offered to meet the family of Warren Fenty, if they so wish, to discuss the delay and its consequences.”The statement added: “The sheriff principal recognises that this is a very unsatisfactory situation and this step has been taken with great reluctance, recognising the harm which the delay to date has already done but also what yet more uncertainty will do to the interests of all parties to the inquiry, not least the family of the deceased. “He will fix a hearing as a matter of urgency for the participants to be given the opportunity to discuss the best way forward. Whatever is decided, the inquiry will be under his sole control, including the preparation of the final determination.” A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “The procurator fiscal will continue to support and provide assistance to the fatal accident inquiry as required. “We will continue to keep the Fenty family updated on any significant developments in relation to the inquiry.” Ms Fenty said she hoped to meet with sheriff Pyle within the next two weeks. “I’ve sat for nearly ten years waiting and waiting to find out what happened to my son. That is a hole that will never fill,” she said.“I don’t want another mother waiting ten years to find out why their child is not here anymore. “","['Police Scotland', 'Justice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/840/cpsprodpb/8d86/live/d3df5dd0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/654/cpsprodpb/c633/live/ad665220-b178-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f405/live/4dce5b80-b17a-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0787/live/2d667bf0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/585/cpsprodpb/cee6/live/bfaf9090-b178-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg']","['Louise Hosie', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland

The SNP leader was pitching to those in Scotland who back the idea of independence, but are flirting with voting Labour to get Rishi Sunak out of Number 10.He essentially told them that they can have their cake and eat it at the next general election.His logic goes like this: Sir Keir Starmer has it in the bag. He will be Prime Minister. Labour’s UK-wide lead is so commanding that Scottish seats won’t swing the election.Therefore, he argues, independence supporters should back the SNP to keep independence on the agenda.Humza Yousaf wants to reassure them that they can have everything they want – an end to Conservative government, whilst keeping the prospect of independence alive and well.The independence part of that message is nothing new. Though there does appear to be a slight change in tone.There was a stark column from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard in recent days. Writing in the Sunday National, he warned “if the SNP lose the election in Scotland, the debate on independence stops”.It appears Humza Yousaf may have been reading at the weekend, because he seems to have adopted elements of this message.Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he said that a big Labour vote in Scotland would take the cause of independence “backwards”. I put it to Humza Yousaf that it sounds like he’s sending a warning to independence supporters. He insisted he isn’t.But he is keen to stress that he believes a lack of SNP MPs won’t just hurt his party, but the wider independence movement.Back at party conference last October, the first minister was keen to talk up the opportunities of SNP success for those who back independence.But it feels like the new year has marked a shift to talking about the pitfalls of an underwhelming performance.He told me any independence supporter “must vote for what you believe in”. In his mind, that’s a vote for the SNP.It’s important to note that other pro-independence parties, such as the Greens and Alba, are available. There’s logic behind his approach. Polls suggest the cause of independence is more popular than the SNP. Humza Yousaf believes tying the two together can improve his party’s chances.Though there are still those who question the specifics on how a large number of SNP MPs shifts the dial on independence in the years ahead. One party figure I spoke to was happy to see the party settle on a more straightforward campaign message. But they were also concerned that some voters unhappy with the SNP/Green government’s performance in Scotland might look to give the party a bloody nose at election time, even if they back independence.This is a theory shared by figures in Scottish Labour.They think that many Scots are underwhelmed by the day-to-day running of the country, and will look to punish the SNP the next time they go to the polls (even if it’s a vote for Westminster, not Holyrood).Scottish Labour also argue that electing their candidates gives Scottish MPs the chance to sit at the heart of the UK government.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nyywen20po,Wrongly accused postmaster died before his name was cleared,,2024-01-12,"A sub-postmaster was haunted by feelings of shame and thought about taking his own life after being accused of stealing money from the Post Office, his widow has said.Dad-of-five Bill Quarm, who ran a post office in the Western Isles, pleaded guilty in 2010 to embezzling money to avoid going to prison.Mr Quarm, who suffered from ill-health, died in 2012 aged 69. His conviction was overturned last year.His widow, Anne, said the threat of jail had been devastating: ""The fear in his eyes - I’ll never forget it."" More than 900 Post Office workers were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches.Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office.The scandal affected up to 100 workers in Scotland, and Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has said he would work with the UK government to ensure victims across the UK were exonerated. The Quarms ran a bed and breakfast and a shop with a post office in Paible, North Uist.Mrs Quarm said the family's happy and busy life came to an end abruptly one night.She said: ""Bill came home looking like death and crying and saying 'I’ve had these guys in bullying me from the Post Office'.""Mr Quarm had been accused of stealing tens of thousands of pounds, and was warned Post Office staff would return within days seeking answers to where the money was.Mrs Quarm said: ""He said ‘Anne, I have no answers’. And he was crying on my shoulder.""I believed Bill.""He was an honourable man and a good husband and father and worked really hard. I had no reason to believe otherwise."" Mr Quarm was accompanied by his brother-in-law at his next meeting with the Post Office.His wife said her husband collapsed during an interview, but he continued to be questioned. His brother-in-law asked for the interview to be stopped so he could catch his breath and get his medication.Mrs Quarm said: ""Lots of things went on in that meeting that I still don’t know to this day because he wouldn’t let me hear how they treated him. ""It’s just painful."" The postmaster's biggest fear was he would be sent to jail, and Mrs Quarm said this led to him having suicidal thoughts.""Short of being a recluse he was distancing himself from the family because he was so depressed and ashamed that he had brought this shame on the home,"" she said.""They (the Post Office) were making him believe that he had brought this shame on us all and the only reason he pled guilty was to try and keep him out of prison and it was shocking. ""Every time he was getting ready for court he had to pack a wee bag because we never thought he would be back.""The fear in his eyes - I’ll never forget it.""Mr Quarm was ordered to carry out community service.Following a deterioration in his health, he died in 2012. Mr Quarm's conviction was quashed at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh on appeal last September.His widow said this had come as a blessing, but she wished her husband had been alive to know he had done nothing wrong.She added that the scandal had lasting impact on her life.""My whole world, everything I had worked so hard to achieve, just came down like a ton of bricks,"" she said.""It’s very hard to imagine what its like to lose your home, your life.""I just knew I had to keep it together for my kids - just to live. ""But it has destroyed something inside. It’s hard."" Meanwhile,  a former sub-postmaster who pled guilty to embezzlement is pressing ahead with his appeal despite plans to pardon all of those affected.Rab Thomson’s lawyer told the appeal court in Edinburgh that he wants to clear his name and is not interested in compensation.Mr Thomson was ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service and pay £5000 after his conviction in 2006.His appeal will be heard by three judges on 1 February.Two other former sub-postmasters have asked for their appeals to be delayed until there is clarity on government plans to pardon and compensate victims.","['Post Office Inquiry', 'Isle of North Uist', 'Paible']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ecc1/live/dca11fe0-b149-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3caa/live/6dcf2240-b12d-11ee-a40b-2b3f99919970.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/403/cpsprodpb/eb8c/live/b68332f0-b147-11ee-a035-7dead463cd44.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/12c9/live/88057f00-b147-11ee-a035-7dead463cd44.jpg']","['Shona MacDonald', 'BBC Naidheachdan']",UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6p119e02v9o,'Confusing' bus gates concerning city shop owners,,2024-01-12,"Restricting some roads in Aberdeen to buses is driving customers away from city centre businesses, according to some businesses. The concerns follow this month's closure of Haigs Food Hall in Schoolhill which had operated for 12 years. The bus priority routes in the city centre were implemented in August last year. Council co-leader Ian Yuill said footfall was recovering and bus passenger numbers had increased. The restrictions, called bus gates, were introduced to reduce the amount of general traffic on Market Street, Guild Street, Union Street and Bridge Street.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) described the measures as a ""challenge"" for those wanting to come into the city centre. Jamie Stewart, the owner of Belmont Street gift shop Juniper, said customer numbers over Christmas and early 2024 were lower than the previous year when they were still feeling the impact of the pandemic. He said customers from the outskirts of the city or Aberdeenshire were being put off by the ""confusing"" bus measures. He said: ""Bus gates seem to be the main issue, it's a fear factor. ""Where do you go? What do you do?""I just don't think our city centre is built in a way that it really works. ""There's a lot less cars in the car parks, and that doesn't mean more people are getting the bus."" Mr Stewart said the closure of smaller shops like Haigs and larger stores such as John Lewis was concerning. He said what pulled people into the city centre were shops, adding: ""You need lots of different shops."" Mike Duncan, FSB north-east development manager, said the restrictions went against the aim of attracting people to the city centre. He said: ""That's what small businesses are concerned about, it is easier to do something else rather than come to Aberdeen city centre. ""The council has a lot of work to do.""He added high business rates and energy costs were putting a strain on businesses. Council co-leader, Liberal Democrat Ian Yuill, said he will meet with the FSB to discuss their concerns but admitted it was too early to make a decision on bus gates. He added: ""What is quite clear is the reliability of bus services has improved and the number of passengers has increased. ""But as you know, Aberdeen City Council like others in Scotland does not set business rates.""","['Aberdeen', 'Federation of Small Businesses (Scotland)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/2efb/live/74dbcdd0-b156-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/925/cpsprodpb/ffaf/live/09046500-b15a-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/b7fc/live/2c097600-b158-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg']","['Robbie Boyle', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67748637,I noticed a bulging lump sensation in my vagina,When Natashja Wilson first noticed she had symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse she had no idea what was happening and was too embarrassed to ask for help.,2024-01-12,"When Natashja Wilson first noticed she had symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse she had no idea what was happening and was too embarrassed to ask for help. Aged just 18 and living away from home at university, she had never heard of the condition which could affect up to 50% of women during their lifetime. ""I noticed when I went to the toilet a bulge was coming out of my vagina,"" she said. ""I was also experiencing incontinence and pain during intercourse and a bulging feeling. ""I didn't really know what to think because I honestly knew nothing about my body at that time."" Natashja, now 24, says she did not know what her pelvic floor or her cervix were at the time. ""So I asked my friends 'Is this bulging lump sensation normal?',"" she said. ""They said, 'Maybe it's your G-spot. Maybe it's just a spot'."" Natashja, from Greenwich in London, didn't know what to think so she left it and hoped it would go away with time. But her symptoms got worse and after 18 months she finally confided in her mum who persuaded her to see a doctor. It was later confirmed she had uterine prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the group of muscles and tissues that normally support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened and cannot hold the organs firmly in place. It causes one or more of the organs to move down from their normal position, leading to a bulge that can be felt inside or outside the vagina. This can be the womb, bowel, bladder or top of the vagina. Many women are unaware they have a prolapse or only have mild symptoms, but for some it can have a real impact on their quality of life. Symptoms can include a heavy dragging sensation or feeling of something coming down the vagina - which is sometimes described like a feeling of 'sitting on a tennis ball' as well as bladder and bowel issues and discomfort during sex. Pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help to improve symptoms, but sometimes medical treatment is needed such as vaginal pessaries or surgery. Causes of prolapse include genetics, heavy lifting, constipation or a persistent cough. Pregnancy and childbirth increase the risk of prolapse, particularly after a difficult labour. Women are also more likely to develop prolapse as they get older, especially after the menopause. But Natashja is keen to make people aware it can affect younger people too. She is trying to lift the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse through social media and her blog 'Living With Prolapse'. ""There's still so much stigma around prolapse, around discussing your genitalia and that doesn't allow for people to go see a doctor,"" she said. ""I know that if there was less stigma I would've gone to a doctor much earlier."" The stories of women hoping to left the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse. Watch now on BBC iPlayer According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) one in 12 women report symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse but on examination it is present in up to 50% of all women. Research yet to be published by Stirling University indicates that embarrassment, lack of awareness and a fear that symptoms won't be taken seriously, all act as barriers to women seeking help for pelvic health problems. The study looked at papers from 24 countries including the UK over the past 20 years, taking in the views of more than 20,000 women. Researchers Clare Jouanny and Dr Purva Abhyankar said: ""There is a large body of evidence from the UK and similar countries across the world that women still face many barriers when it comes to seeking help for women's health issues like prolapse. ""We need to focus not only on increasing awareness and education among women and clinicians, but more importantly we need to work with clinicians to change women's perception that clinicians don't take them seriously with pelvic health symptoms."" Pelvic health physiotherapist Suzanne Vernazza is on a mission to educate women about their pelvic health. She is the founder of the not-for-profit company Know Your Floors and her daily 'SqueezeAlong' pelvic floor exercise tutorials have more than 600,000 followers on TikTok. She says it is important for people to raise pelvic health concerns with their GP. ""If you've been feeling something that at any point doesn't feel quite right, whether you're pregnant or postnatal, raise it and ask the question because more than likely, you're right that it's not right - and you can have support for you to be able to manage that,"" she said. The Royal College of GPs said its doctors are well trained to diagnose and care for people affected by prolapse. RCGP Scotland deputy chairman Dr Chris Williams said: ""GPs are aware of the embarrassment or stigma that can be associated with this condition and strive to ensure women feel comfortable and empowered to seek support if experiencing symptoms."" Sam Hindle experienced bladder prolapse after the birth of her son 24 years ago and has been incontinent ever since. ""It was that bad that my two-year-old son was having to go and fetch mummy clean pants, clean trousers,"" she said.  ""It was embarrassing to have your two-year-old run about and say ' Oh Mummy's had an accident, I need to help'.'"" The 47-year-old, from Edinburgh, was one of tens of thousands of women in the UK to have transvaginal mesh surgery to treat prolapse and incontinence. Its use was halted in the UK in 2018 due to the life-changing side-effects many women suffered. Sam said she had been left in constant pain and suffers from PTSD as a result of the procedure. She hopes to have her mesh removed by a specialist in the United States and is currently on a waiting list for assessment in Glasgow. She said it was important for people to talk about pelvic health. ""Just like menopause, it's a subject that we need to remove the stigma of and talk about and let people not feel embarrassed about this so they will go and seek help,"" she said. ""You look at other females in the family who are having children and you think, 'Oh I'd better warn them, I better make sure they know about pelvic floor exercises and they know how to avoid possibly getting into the mess I did with bladder prolapse."" Natashja said prolapse affects women of all ages and it does not discriminate. ""I noticed my symptoms when I was 18 and when I went on Google it was only telling me that elderly women were impacted,"" she said. ""The doctors were so shocked that someone of my age had prolapse and it made me feel very isolated."" Natashja said she is now feeling positive about the future. She has been working with a pelvic health physiotherapist and uses a vaginal pessary, a device that helps to support the vaginal walls and pelvic organs, which means she feels more confident doing exercise. She said the support and advice of the online community had also helped her to cope. ""If you have just been diagnosed with prolapse, it's important to know you do not have to go through this alone,"" she said. ""There is an army of women out there willing to support you and help you through your journey and they can understand what you're going through and help you through it.""","['Health', ""Women's health"", 'Women']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0B2E/production/_132126820_female_anatomy_2x_640-nc-002.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0253/production/_124659500_generic_banner_top.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/105E8/production/_132084076_index_promo_prolapse.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2BC/production/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15020/production/_132084068_suzannepic1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/69A8/production/_132084072_sampic.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0030/production/_132084000_natasha2.jpg']","['By Hayley Jarvis', 'BBC Scotland reporter']",UK,Scotland

The first tribunal ruled Sheriff Jack Brown's conduct toward a woman known as X was ""entirely inappropriate"" but did not justify his removal from office. X said evidence from two women making similar claims should have been heard. Mr Brown has been suspended on full pay since the allegations came to light in 2018. Judge Lord Woolman said the original tribunal had proceeded in ""ignorance of the availability of other evidence"". The new tribunal was constituted in 2022 by then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the request of the Lord President. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""Sheriff Jack Brown is subject to ongoing Fitness for Judicial Office Tribunal proceedings. ""Once the tribunal has made its decision, ministers will lay the tribunal's report before the Scottish Parliament in line with duties set out in the Court Reform (Scotland) Act 2014."" X, who is a lawyer, had raised judicial review proceedings to quash the decision of the original fitness for office tribunal, which was the first of its kind to be carried out in Scotland. The fitness for judicial office tribunal issued its decision in March 2021. It found that Mr Brown's behaviour had been ""entirely inappropriate"" and that he had ""failed to respect proper professional boundaries"". X had alleged inappropriate and unwelcome physical contact towards her, including a claim that he touched her bottom. The tribunal upheld one allegation, that Mr Brown had hugged X and made a remark towards her. But it said the other allegations had not been established on the balance of probabilities. Mr Brown was arrested and charged in relation to the allegations in January 2019, but prosecutors dropped the case three months later. He was appointed to the sheriffdom of Aberdeen in 2016. Mr Brown set up his own legal practice in Dundee in 1996, and has been a sheriff since 2005. An order granting his anonymity in the judicial review hearing was lifted following a successful challenge by BBC Scotland. During the judicial review hearing, X's legal team said there was a ""real possibility"" that the tribunal's decision would have been different if the other women's evidence had been made available to it. Mr Brown's lawyer argued that X's petition was ""no more than an invitation to the court to allow the petitioner to 'have another go' on the entirely speculative basis that a different outcome might be possible"".","['Aberdeen', 'Dundee']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/19C4/production/_132269560_20181112_sheriff_jack_brown_001.jpg'],"['By Graeme Ogston', 'BBC Scotland Tayside and Central reporter']",UK,Scotland

Sammy Wilkinson, from Tipton, has transported dozens of dogs to Scotland as tighter laws on their ownership were introduced in England and Wales.First Minister Humza Yousaf has since said the Scottish government will replicate the law which bans the breed without a licence.Mr Wilkinson said the welfare of animals was at the forefront of his mind. He said dogs had been dumped or abandoned in England as a result of the law change and the Scottish government had not learnt anything from it.He has not just been rehoming in Scotland. He said he had also taken dogs across England to where owners could take them in according to the restrictions.When the Scottish ban comes into effect, he said, he may look to go further afield, and has been contacted by a German charity which is willing to help.  “I haven’t taken a particular interest in Scotland, I’ve rehomed everywhere.""I’ve rehomed south in Plymouth, Portsmouth, as long as the dog is vetted and the home has been checked out and it is a compatible dog with a compatible owner, I’m happy to keep rehoming them,"" he said. In order to keep a bully XL in England and Wales, owners must have the dog microchipped, neutered, kept on a lead and muzzled in public.  Owners must be over 16, have insurance against their dog injuring other people and have applied for a Certificate of Exemption.Mr Wilkinson previously said he believed some owners had been irresponsible in taking on the dogs in the first place.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdll0ypenlo,Alan Cumming: I feel like Bond villain in US Traitors,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"".",2024-01-12,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"". Cumming, who actually appeared in 1995 Bond film Goldeneye, says the  producers of the reality show wanted him to ""camp it up"" and host it as an over-the-top character.So he adopts an eccentric Scottish accent, quotes Shakespeare and pokes fun at the contestants - but Cumming says he is still heavily invested in the drama which he watches on live feeds in his dressing room.""I can see them. I do feel like a James Bond villain,"" he says while laughing and stroking an imaginary cat, mimicking one of 007's most famous adversaries Ernst Blofeld.In fact Cumming says that when he accepted the role, he suggested that he could bring his dog to stroke menacingly instead.The idea was not taken up for the first series because his dog Lala could not travel to Scotland for the filming. ""My dog's in the second one,"" Cumming says with a smile. Season two of the US version of The Traitors is currently airing, at the same time as the UK version - hosted by Claudia Winkleman on BBC One.Both are filmed at Ardross Castle in Easter Ross and involve ""faithful"" contestants trying to discover and eliminate the traitors in their midst.Cumming hosts the US version wearing increasingly flamboyant costumes, with accessories added as each episode progresses.He tells BBC Scotland's The Edit his exaggerated Scottish accent is ""me playing Moira Rose from Schitt's Creek playing Alan Cumming"". Cumming says the US version is also different because the contestants are all celebrities to some degree, generally reality TV stars. ""It heightens the drama, they understand how to do drama,"" he says. While UK viewers may not be familiar with many of the celebrities, there is one they might recognise.John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of the more surprising contestants in the US show. Cumming says: ""It was fascinating to see what the Americans made of him because none of them knew who he was.""They thought he talked too much, and he did.""However, Cumming says: ""In the end, he became a team player."" He says he loved teasing Bercow during the filming of the show. ""It's hilarious, I loved bossing him about,"" Cumming says. ""Any opportunity to go, 'order, order, John,'."" Cumming, from Aberfeldy in Perthshire, made his acting debut in the 1980s and is perhaps best remembered in Scotland for the comedy series The High Life which he created with Forbes Masson.In the decades since he has appeared in dozens of films including Spy Kids and X-Men 2 as well as having a starring role in the US TV series The Good Wife.Now 58, Cumming is thinking more about ageing and it is the focus of his new solo tour, set to begin later this month, called Alan Cumming is Not Acting His Age.He describes the show as akin to an old-fashioned cabaret, featuring a performance filled with music and discussions covering a range of topics such as sex, death, and alcohol. Cumming says there are under-discussed positives to getting older.""You get wiser, you don't worry so much,"" he says. ""Wisdom is about realising life is a cyclical thing, the same things keep coming around. ""It's the same show with different costumes."" Cumming says realising this enables better decision-making later in life and being open to the possibility of new experiences.""We worship at the altar of youth,"" he says.""I talk about this in the show, why have we decided that something that is inevitable, inexorable, like ageing is the worst possible thing in the world? ""We need to find beauty in not just youth."" The US version of The Traitors TV show is released on the streaming service Peacock on 12 January.Cumming's Glasgow tour date is scheduled for 20 January at the SSE Hydro.BBC Scotland's The Edit will feature Cumming on Saturday 20 January.",['Television'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b7b4/live/739e21f0-b08b-11ee-8322-4bb23593d9c9.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/927/cpsprodpb/0702/live/40740ab0-b090-11ee-b98c-a15f44e54519.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/665/cpsprodpb/cc9e/live/bdef8450-b168-11ee-af67-9d20bbc18f6a.jpg']","['Oliver Coe', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p1rdzyg6mo,We're playing shinty for the first time in our 80s,The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll.,2024-01-12,"The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll. But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty. ""The amazing work of Shinty Memories Scotland and their cluster groups in bringing together older people to engage in the sport is truly inspiring.""However, Laurene has gone one step further - amazing.""","['Elderly people', 'Lochgilphead', 'Mental health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/b6ad/live/ab7bc9f0-af38-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/945/cpsprodpb/1c13/live/091d63d0-afb0-11ee-b3f7-fd8c6292139d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/970/cpsprodpb/2200/live/cb0e62a0-b0b9-11ee-ad9c-fd8d022d1d63.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/694/cpsprodpb/653a/live/33b07e40-af3b-11ee-a916-3396d6d92381.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/836/cpsprodpb/fdb4/live/f0466e50-b0b9-11ee-a40e-199b105537bc.jpg']","['Andreas Wolff', 'BBC Naidheachdan']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cv2l1yjlew2o,Mother 'devastated' as 10-year inquiry delayed again,A woman who has waited nearly 10 years for the findings of a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into her son’s death has told the BBC she feels “let down and devastated” after it emerged there will be a further delay to its publication.,2024-01-12,"A woman who has waited nearly 10 years for the findings of a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into her son’s death has told the BBC she feels “let down and devastated” after it emerged there will be a further delay to its publication.  Warren Fenty, 20, from Aberdeen, died from a drugs overdose while in police custody in 2014. Sheriff Morag McLaughlin’s findings were due to be published this month, following a number of previous delays. But the Scottish Courts Service has confirmed that due to “personal health reasons” Sheriff McLaughlin can no longer produce the determination, and it will now be taken over by the Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Derek Pyle. Warren’s mother, Sharon Fenty, told BBC Scotland News:  “I just feel empty, let down and devastated. I can’t get my head around it.“I need answers, I’ve been waiting for answers for nearly ten years.“Does this mean that the whole thing will have to start again? I have so many questions. It feels like delay after delay.“There have been a lot of mistakes made. For the first couple of years or so it was just passed to the side. Then there was Covid. But I think it’s terrible that anyone has had to wait so long.”She added urgent changes were needed around the timings of FAIs to prevent other families going through the same experience. Mr Fenty died at Aberdeen’s Kittybrewster police station in June 2014. He had been arrested after discharging himself from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, against medical advice, and was being held in Kittybrewster’s custody suite. The inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently the longest ongoing FAI in Scotland. A Judicial Office spokesperson said: “Sheriff principal Pyle, the sheriff principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands, has been monitoring progress of the preparation of sheriff McLaughlin’s determination in this inquiry over an extended period. “The sheriff principal will now take personal control of the inquiry and has offered to meet the family of Warren Fenty, if they so wish, to discuss the delay and its consequences.”The statement added: “The sheriff principal recognises that this is a very unsatisfactory situation and this step has been taken with great reluctance, recognising the harm which the delay to date has already done but also what yet more uncertainty will do to the interests of all parties to the inquiry, not least the family of the deceased. “He will fix a hearing as a matter of urgency for the participants to be given the opportunity to discuss the best way forward. Whatever is decided, the inquiry will be under his sole control, including the preparation of the final determination.” A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “The procurator fiscal will continue to support and provide assistance to the fatal accident inquiry as required. “We will continue to keep the Fenty family updated on any significant developments in relation to the inquiry.” Ms Fenty said she hoped to meet with sheriff Pyle within the next two weeks. “I’ve sat for nearly ten years waiting and waiting to find out what happened to my son. That is a hole that will never fill,” she said.“I don’t want another mother waiting ten years to find out why their child is not here anymore. “","['Police Scotland', 'Justice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/840/cpsprodpb/8d86/live/d3df5dd0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/654/cpsprodpb/c633/live/ad665220-b178-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f405/live/4dce5b80-b17a-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0787/live/2d667bf0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/585/cpsprodpb/cee6/live/bfaf9090-b178-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg']","['Louise Hosie', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nyywen20po,Wrongly accused postmaster died before his name was cleared,,2024-01-12,"A sub-postmaster was haunted by feelings of shame and thought about taking his own life after being accused of stealing money from the Post Office, his widow has said.Dad-of-five Bill Quarm, who ran a post office in the Western Isles, pleaded guilty in 2010 to embezzling money to avoid going to prison.Mr Quarm, who suffered from ill-health, died in 2012 aged 69. His conviction was overturned last year.His widow, Anne, said the threat of jail had been devastating: ""The fear in his eyes - I’ll never forget it."" More than 900 Post Office workers were prosecuted after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches.Their case is back in the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office.The scandal affected up to 100 workers in Scotland, and Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has said he would work with the UK government to ensure victims across the UK were exonerated. The Quarms ran a bed and breakfast and a shop with a post office in Paible, North Uist.Mrs Quarm said the family's happy and busy life came to an end abruptly one night.She said: ""Bill came home looking like death and crying and saying 'I’ve had these guys in bullying me from the Post Office'.""Mr Quarm had been accused of stealing tens of thousands of pounds, and was warned Post Office staff would return within days seeking answers to where the money was.Mrs Quarm said: ""He said ‘Anne, I have no answers’. And he was crying on my shoulder.""I believed Bill.""He was an honourable man and a good husband and father and worked really hard. I had no reason to believe otherwise."" Mr Quarm was accompanied by his brother-in-law at his next meeting with the Post Office.His wife said her husband collapsed during an interview, but he continued to be questioned. His brother-in-law asked for the interview to be stopped so he could catch his breath and get his medication.Mrs Quarm said: ""Lots of things went on in that meeting that I still don’t know to this day because he wouldn’t let me hear how they treated him. ""It’s just painful."" The postmaster's biggest fear was he would be sent to jail, and Mrs Quarm said this led to him having suicidal thoughts.""Short of being a recluse he was distancing himself from the family because he was so depressed and ashamed that he had brought this shame on the home,"" she said.""They (the Post Office) were making him believe that he had brought this shame on us all and the only reason he pled guilty was to try and keep him out of prison and it was shocking. ""Every time he was getting ready for court he had to pack a wee bag because we never thought he would be back.""The fear in his eyes - I’ll never forget it.""Mr Quarm was ordered to carry out community service.Following a deterioration in his health, he died in 2012. Mr Quarm's conviction was quashed at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh on appeal last September.His widow said this had come as a blessing, but she wished her husband had been alive to know he had done nothing wrong.She added that the scandal had lasting impact on her life.""My whole world, everything I had worked so hard to achieve, just came down like a ton of bricks,"" she said.""It’s very hard to imagine what its like to lose your home, your life.""I just knew I had to keep it together for my kids - just to live. ""But it has destroyed something inside. It’s hard."" Meanwhile,  a former sub-postmaster who pled guilty to embezzlement is pressing ahead with his appeal despite plans to pardon all of those affected.Rab Thomson’s lawyer told the appeal court in Edinburgh that he wants to clear his name and is not interested in compensation.Mr Thomson was ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service and pay £5000 after his conviction in 2006.His appeal will be heard by three judges on 1 February.Two other former sub-postmasters have asked for their appeals to be delayed until there is clarity on government plans to pardon and compensate victims.","['Post Office Inquiry', 'Isle of North Uist', 'Paible']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ecc1/live/dca11fe0-b149-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3caa/live/6dcf2240-b12d-11ee-a40b-2b3f99919970.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/403/cpsprodpb/eb8c/live/b68332f0-b147-11ee-a035-7dead463cd44.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/12c9/live/88057f00-b147-11ee-a035-7dead463cd44.jpg']","['Shona MacDonald', 'BBC Naidheachdan']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-67957235,Airbnb cottage near Inverness trashed by puppy seller,An Airbnb owner was left horrified after discovering her Highlands property had been trashed by a puppy seller over the course of three days.,2024-01-12,"An Airbnb owner was left horrified after discovering her Highlands property had been trashed by a puppy seller over the course of three days. ""Superhost"" Tracey Parsons, 55, had rented out the cottage, near Inverness, to a woman for 10 days last weekend. But on Tuesday, 14 puppies and a dog were discovered at the property which was covered in dog faeces and rubbish. ""I was absolutely stunned,"" Ms Parsons said. ""I couldn't believe it."" She said she and her partner David Bradley, 55, had been alerted by a neighbour who had seen what she believed to be an abandoned car containing puppies. On knocking at the cottage, she had been hit by a foul smell and dogs yapping. Mr Bradley attended the property where he found a couple outside waiting to buy a puppy. They told him they were paying £1,500 for it. They left after seeing photographs from inside. ""The woman who had rented the cottage wasn't going to let my partner in,"" Ms Parsons told BBC Scotland News. ""He was absolutely gobsmacked at what he saw."" Ms Parsons also went to the property where she said the found the inside of the cottage covered in dog faeces. ""It was right up the walls and bins were full of it,"" she said. ""It was also on the floor wrapped in kitchen roll and had blocked the toilet. ""The puppies were caked in it and they stank. ""The woman just let them poo and wee everywhere. She even managed to break the washing machine."" Ms Parsons said: ""It's just shocking. This is the Highlands. It's quiet. People don't do that here. ""We have rented out the cottage for a few years and it's always been left in an immaculate condition. We've never had any problems before."" She also said some of the puppies were in a cage which also contained metal lids from dog food cans. It is understood by BBC Scotland News that the puppy seller, who booked the cottage under the name Rachel Tidey but has sent emails to the BBC from Camille Harland, has now been suspended from Airbnb. She claimed some of the mess had been caused by the police allowing puppies to ""run loose for a few hours"". ""It was not all pre-existing damage,"" she said. ""I did offer to clean and pay for cleaning fees but the owners told me to leave. ""The puppies are all registered to me and were found to be healthy by the SSPCA and the police said there was no evidence of a crime being committed."" She added that the information about the couple waiting at the property to buy a puppy was not accurate as she did not usually charge that price for a puppy. Ms Parsons said there were two litters of puppies and that the Scottish SPCA estimated one of them to be five or six weeks weeks old and the other a few weeks older. ""When I rang Airbnb to tell them what had happened the man said 'but you're dog friendly',"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it."" The couple have spent two days having the cottage deep cleaned before being repainted. ""It will be a couple of weeks before we can have guests in again,"" Ms Parsons said. ""On the day, I felt like giving up. I just thought it's not worth the stress. ""It does put you off a bit and makes you more wary but we've now bought a security camera for the outside of the house. ""You just have to get on with it."" The couple called in the police and Scottish SPCA. The puppies were originally seized by the charity but were returned to the owner. Scottish SPCA inspector Andy Brown said the charity was called out to the cottage on Tuesday after receiving reports of puppies being left in a vehicle for days. ""When we attended there were no dogs in the vehicle,"" he said. ""A number of puppies were being kept in the property, along with their mum, and we had these animals checked over by a vet. ""The vet had no concerns over their health. We are continuing to work with the owner of these animals to ensure they are being appropriately cared for."" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""Officers attended along with a partner agency and carried out inquiries. No criminality was established, and no further police action was taken."" A spokesperson for Airbnb said: ""We were deeply saddened to hear about this and our specialist team is in touch with the host to provide support.

""Superhost"" Tracey Parsons, 55, had rented out the cottage, near Inverness, to a woman for 10 days last weekend. But on Tuesday, 14 puppies and a dog were discovered at the property which was covered in dog faeces and rubbish. ""I was absolutely stunned,"" Ms Parsons said. ""I couldn't believe it."" She said she and her partner David Bradley, 55, had been alerted by a neighbour who had seen what she believed to be an abandoned car containing puppies. On knocking at the cottage, she had been hit by a foul smell and dogs yapping. Mr Bradley attended the property where he found a couple outside waiting to buy a puppy. They told him they were paying £1,500 for it. They left after seeing photographs from inside.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjlg32ngwrzo,A shift in tone as the SNP gears up for election,"When Rishi Sunak announced it was his “working assumption” that there would be a general election in the second half of this year, he effectively fired the campaign starting gun.",2024-01-12,"When Rishi Sunak announced it was his “working assumption” that there would be a general election in the second half of this year, he effectively fired the campaign starting gun.And Humza Yousaf has wasted no time in spelling out the message he wants to hammer home in the months ahead.He treated activists and sitting MPs and MSPs to a speech in Glasgow on Friday.But – given that he can already rely on their votes – they weren’t the intended audience. The SNP leader was pitching to those in Scotland who back the idea of independence, but are flirting with voting Labour to get Rishi Sunak out of Number 10.He essentially told them that they can have their cake and eat it at the next general election.His logic goes like this: Sir Keir Starmer has it in the bag. He will be Prime Minister. Labour’s UK-wide lead is so commanding that Scottish seats won’t swing the election.Therefore, he argues, independence supporters should back the SNP to keep independence on the agenda.Humza Yousaf wants to reassure them that they can have everything they want – an end to Conservative government, whilst keeping the prospect of independence alive and well.The independence part of that message is nothing new. Though there does appear to be a slight change in tone.There was a stark column from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard in recent days. Writing in the Sunday National, he warned “if the SNP lose the election in Scotland, the debate on independence stops”.It appears Humza Yousaf may have been reading at the weekend, because he seems to have adopted elements of this message.Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he said that a big Labour vote in Scotland would take the cause of independence “backwards”. I put it to Humza Yousaf that it sounds like he’s sending a warning to independence supporters. He insisted he isn’t.But he is keen to stress that he believes a lack of SNP MPs won’t just hurt his party, but the wider independence movement.Back at party conference last October, the first minister was keen to talk up the opportunities of SNP success for those who back independence.But it feels like the new year has marked a shift to talking about the pitfalls of an underwhelming performance.He told me any independence supporter “must vote for what you believe in”. In his mind, that’s a vote for the SNP.It’s important to note that other pro-independence parties, such as the Greens and Alba, are available. There’s logic behind his approach. Polls suggest the cause of independence is more popular than the SNP. Humza Yousaf believes tying the two together can improve his party’s chances.Though there are still those who question the specifics on how a large number of SNP MPs shifts the dial on independence in the years ahead. One party figure I spoke to was happy to see the party settle on a more straightforward campaign message. But they were also concerned that some voters unhappy with the SNP/Green government’s performance in Scotland might look to give the party a bloody nose at election time, even if they back independence.This is a theory shared by figures in Scottish Labour.They think that many Scots are underwhelmed by the day-to-day running of the country, and will look to punish the SNP the next time they go to the polls (even if it’s a vote for Westminster, not Holyrood).Scottish Labour also argue that electing their candidates gives Scottish MPs the chance to sit at the heart of the UK government. The Scottish Conservatives will be content with the ground on which Humza Yousaf hopes to fight the forthcoming election.If he wants to talk about independence, they’re more than happy to play ball and put forward the opposing side of the argument. Elections soak up a lot of a party leader’s time and energy. And Humza Yousaf already has plenty on his plate.He’s responsible for day-to-day government in Scotland. And SNP infighting is more public than at any time in recent political memory.But at least one of his jobs seems to be done – he’s settled on a campaign message. As ever, the key question is ‘will it work?’It’s easy to see the rationality behind the approach Humza Yousaf is taking. But you’re a brave person if you’re willing to predict the outcome of an election that may yet be the best part of a year away.","['Scottish government', 'SNP (Scottish National Party)', 'Labour Party', 'Scottish independence', 'Humza Yousaf']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/077a/live/44759a10-b172-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/dd15/live/a9460330-b172-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg']","['David Wallace Lockhart', 'BBC Scotland political correspondent', '@BBCDavidWL']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67957694,Poor Things: 'I don't mind they erased Glasgow from dad's book',The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend.,2024-01-12,"The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend. Based on a 1992 novel by Scots artist and writer Alasdair Gray, it's the fantastical tale of a woman who takes her own life and is revived by a Victorian surgeon who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos was blown away by the book which he first read in 2009. ""I completely fell in love with Bella Baxter - and it was obvious to me that somehow I had to bring her to life. ""I was surprised no one had made a film version."" In fact, there was a film version - written by Alasdair Gray and Sandy Johnson - just two years after the book was published. They envisaged a cast which included Robert Carlisle and Helena Bonham Carter but it was a project which didn't get off the ground. Lanthimos travelled to Glasgow in 2011 to meet Alasdair Gray, and was taken on a tour of the places mentioned in the book. A year later, Lanthimos acquired the film rights. A decade later, with a screenplay by Tony McNamara, the film began shooting on a set in Hungary, the Glasgow locations replaced with futuristic versions of Paris, Lisbon and London. It has led to a frenzied debate on social media about whether the loss of the location has lessened the film. But Alasdair Gray's son Andrew, who looks after the Gray estate, disagrees. He believes the production and its entire cast and crew treated the book with respect. ""When I met the cast, a lot of people had read the book so I was very impressed with that. ""My father didn't set any pre-conditions when he met Yorgos. The contract was drawn up, probably around 2012 and he was aware and in agreement with the circumstances of it. ""He wasn't a film director. He was happy for someone else to take on his work."" There's also more than a hint of Gray in the character of Baxter, played by Willem Dafoe. The Frankenstein patchwork of his face has echoes of Alasdair Gray's chiselled artwork and he uses the same gentle accent and singsong voice as Gray himself. ""I listened to tapes of Alasdair Gray,"" he said,"" and even though I wasn't trying to copy that accent I liked how he spoke and he had a wicked sense of humour and I think he put a lot of himself into the character of Baxter."" The film has been garnering awards since it first won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September. Last week it won two Golden Globes and is now being tipped for Bafta and Oscar success. ""It's very much like a fairy tale for me,"" says Andrew Gray, who's seen the film seven times, including a special screening at the Glasgow Film Theatre and another in his neighbourhood cinema in Connecticut where he's lived for the last 30 years. ""It's not often you get invited to red carpet events, I know the experience is temporary but it's been good fun."" Gray, who died in 2019 at the age of 85 was one of Scotland's greatest artists and writers. His first novel Lanark, published in 1981, is widely regarded as a landmark publication, responsible for a renaissance in Scottish writing. One of his artworks, in private hands since it was created in the 1950s, sold at auction last week for a record £42,700. Andrew Gray believes it's long overdue attention. ""I think Alasdair has been neglected over the years and I'm hoping this will being more international attention to his work,"" he said. ""The limelight that this film has shared onto his work is certainly going to promote his writing and his art. It's going to bring new readers back to the book."" And that's the hope they have at the National Library of Scotland which holds his literary archive. It includes handwritten notes, manuscripts, artworks and letters. There are three early versions of Poor Creatures, which would go on to become Poor Things. In the correspondence is a letter from Gray to Yorgos Lanthimos after his visit to Glasgow, wishing him the best for his film adaptation. Colin McIlroy, curator of modern literary manuscripts said: ""There are hundreds and hundreds of boxes. ""And it covers pretty much the working process for almost all of his written output: novels, short stories, dramas, radio adaptations, film scripts, diaries, and correspondence."" Some of the archive is available for consultation in the library's reading rooms but with 200 boxes, spanning a career of almost seven decades, the library is currently fundraising for a full time cataloguer. Chris Cassells, head of archives and manuscript collections at the library said: ""This is a collection of international significance - one of the biggest literary archives we have. ""We would very much hope that, given the amount of attention the film has received, given that it's really put Alasdair's name in the spotlight internationally, that people will watch the film before reading the book. ""And then they'll read other books and explore perhaps further into the hinterlands of Scottish literature.""","['Glasgow', 'Film', 'Literature']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17F1E/production/_132287089_poor2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/09E1/production/_132292520_poor.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A621/production/_132292524_961debfb11d4229fa7e8385e9fea8b0d00de70e2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5801/production/_132292522_willem.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11B51/production/_132292527_4f766def-54a3-4e0b-8306-3d8239f52c67.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3C9/production/_132292914_0ced4fed-a357-4985-8ab0-33d215f4f1fc.jpg']","['By Pauline McLean', 'BBC Scotland arts correspondent']",UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cv2l1yjlew2o,Mother 'devastated' as 10-year inquiry delayed again,A woman who has waited nearly 10 years for the findings of a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into her son’s death has told the BBC she feels “let down and devastated” after it emerged there will be a further delay to its publication.,2024-01-12,"A woman who has waited nearly 10 years for the findings of a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into her son’s death has told the BBC she feels “let down and devastated” after it emerged there will be a further delay to its publication.  Warren Fenty, 20, from Aberdeen, died from a drugs overdose while in police custody in 2014. Sheriff Morag McLaughlin’s findings were due to be published this month, following a number of previous delays. But the Scottish Courts Service has confirmed that due to “personal health reasons” Sheriff McLaughlin can no longer produce the determination, and it will now be taken over by the Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Derek Pyle. Warren’s mother, Sharon Fenty, told BBC Scotland News:  “I just feel empty, let down and devastated. I can’t get my head around it.“I need answers, I’ve been waiting for answers for nearly ten years.“Does this mean that the whole thing will have to start again? I have so many questions. It feels like delay after delay.“There have been a lot of mistakes made. For the first couple of years or so it was just passed to the side. Then there was Covid. But I think it’s terrible that anyone has had to wait so long.”She added urgent changes were needed around the timings of FAIs to prevent other families going through the same experience. Mr Fenty died at Aberdeen’s Kittybrewster police station in June 2014. He had been arrested after discharging himself from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, against medical advice, and was being held in Kittybrewster’s custody suite. The inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently the longest ongoing FAI in Scotland. A Judicial Office spokesperson said: “Sheriff principal Pyle, the sheriff principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands, has been monitoring progress of the preparation of sheriff McLaughlin’s determination in this inquiry over an extended period. “The sheriff principal will now take personal control of the inquiry and has offered to meet the family of Warren Fenty, if they so wish, to discuss the delay and its consequences.”The statement added: “The sheriff principal recognises that this is a very unsatisfactory situation and this step has been taken with great reluctance, recognising the harm which the delay to date has already done but also what yet more uncertainty will do to the interests of all parties to the inquiry, not least the family of the deceased. “He will fix a hearing as a matter of urgency for the participants to be given the opportunity to discuss the best way forward. Whatever is decided, the inquiry will be under his sole control, including the preparation of the final determination.” A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “The procurator fiscal will continue to support and provide assistance to the fatal accident inquiry as required. “We will continue to keep the Fenty family updated on any significant developments in relation to the inquiry.” Ms Fenty said she hoped to meet with sheriff Pyle within the next two weeks. “I’ve sat for nearly ten years waiting and waiting to find out what happened to my son. That is a hole that will never fill,” she said.“I don’t want another mother waiting ten years to find out why their child is not here anymore. “","['Police Scotland', 'Justice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/840/cpsprodpb/8d86/live/d3df5dd0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/654/cpsprodpb/c633/live/ad665220-b178-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f405/live/4dce5b80-b17a-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0787/live/2d667bf0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/585/cpsprodpb/cee6/live/bfaf9090-b178-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg']","['Louise Hosie', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdll0ypenlo,Alan Cumming: I feel like Bond villain in US Traitors,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"".",2024-01-12,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"". Cumming, who actually appeared in 1995 Bond film Goldeneye, says the  producers of the reality show wanted him to ""camp it up"" and host it as an over-the-top character.So he adopts an eccentric Scottish accent, quotes Shakespeare and pokes fun at the contestants - but Cumming says he is still heavily invested in the drama which he watches on live feeds in his dressing room.""I can see them. I do feel like a James Bond villain,"" he says while laughing and stroking an imaginary cat, mimicking one of 007's most famous adversaries Ernst Blofeld.In fact Cumming says that when he accepted the role, he suggested that he could bring his dog to stroke menacingly instead.The idea was not taken up for the first series because his dog Lala could not travel to Scotland for the filming. ""My dog's in the second one,"" Cumming says with a smile. Season two of the US version of The Traitors is currently airing, at the same time as the UK version - hosted by Claudia Winkleman on BBC One.Both are filmed at Ardross Castle in Easter Ross and involve ""faithful"" contestants trying to discover and eliminate the traitors in their midst.Cumming hosts the US version wearing increasingly flamboyant costumes, with accessories added as each episode progresses.He tells BBC Scotland's The Edit his exaggerated Scottish accent is ""me playing Moira Rose from Schitt's Creek playing Alan Cumming"". Cumming says the US version is also different because the contestants are all celebrities to some degree, generally reality TV stars. ""It heightens the drama, they understand how to do drama,"" he says. While UK viewers may not be familiar with many of the celebrities, there is one they might recognise.John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of the more surprising contestants in the US show. Cumming says: ""It was fascinating to see what the Americans made of him because none of them knew who he was.""They thought he talked too much, and he did.""However, Cumming says: ""In the end, he became a team player."" He says he loved teasing Bercow during the filming of the show. ""It's hilarious, I loved bossing him about,"" Cumming says. ""Any opportunity to go, 'order, order, John,'."" Cumming, from Aberfeldy in Perthshire, made his acting debut in the 1980s and is perhaps best remembered in Scotland for the comedy series The High Life which he created with Forbes Masson.In the decades since he has appeared in dozens of films including Spy Kids and X-Men 2 as well as having a starring role in the US TV series The Good Wife.Now 58, Cumming is thinking more about ageing and it is the focus of his new solo tour, set to begin later this month, called Alan Cumming is Not Acting His Age.He describes the show as akin to an old-fashioned cabaret, featuring a performance filled with music and discussions covering a range of topics such as sex, death, and alcohol. Cumming says there are under-discussed positives to getting older.""You get wiser, you don't worry so much,"" he says. ""Wisdom is about realising life is a cyclical thing, the same things keep coming around. ""It's the same show with different costumes.""

Based on a 1992 novel by Scots artist and writer Alasdair Gray, it's the fantastical tale of a woman who takes her own life and is revived by a Victorian surgeon who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos was blown away by the book which he first read in 2009. ""I completely fell in love with Bella Baxter - and it was obvious to me that somehow I had to bring her to life. ""I was surprised no one had made a film version."" In fact, there was a film version - written by Alasdair Gray and Sandy Johnson - just two years after the book was published. They envisaged a cast which included Robert Carlisle and Helena Bonham Carter but it was a project which didn't get off the ground. Lanthimos travelled to Glasgow in 2011 to meet Alasdair Gray, and was taken on a tour of the places mentioned in the book. A year later, Lanthimos acquired the film rights. A decade later, with a screenplay by Tony McNamara, the film began shooting on a set in Hungary, the Glasgow locations replaced with futuristic versions of Paris, Lisbon and London. It has led to a frenzied debate on social media about whether the loss of the location has lessened the film. But Alasdair Gray's son Andrew, who looks after the Gray estate, disagrees. He believes the production and its entire cast and crew treated the book with respect. ""When I met the cast, a lot of people had read the book so I was very impressed with that. ""My father didn't set any pre-conditions when he met Yorgos. The contract was drawn up, probably around 2012 and he was aware and in agreement with the circumstances of it. ""He wasn't a film director. He was happy for someone else to take on his work."" There's also more than a hint of Gray in the character of Baxter, played by Willem Dafoe. The Frankenstein patchwork of his face has echoes of Alasdair Gray's chiselled artwork and he uses the same gentle accent and singsong voice as Gray himself. ""I listened to tapes of Alasdair Gray,"" he said,"" and even though I wasn't trying to copy that accent I liked how he spoke and he had a wicked sense of humour and I think he put a lot of himself into the character of Baxter."" The film has been garnering awards since it first won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September. Last week it won two Golden Globes and is now being tipped for Bafta and Oscar success. ""It's very much like a fairy tale for me,"" says Andrew Gray, who's seen the film seven times, including a special screening at the Glasgow Film Theatre and another in his neighbourhood cinema in Connecticut where he's lived for the last 30 years. ""It's not often you get invited to red carpet events, I know the experience is temporary but it's been good fun."" Gray, who died in 2019 at the age of 85 was one of Scotland's greatest artists and writers. His first novel Lanark, published in 1981, is widely regarded as a landmark publication, responsible for a renaissance in Scottish writing. One of his artworks, in private hands since it was created in the 1950s, sold at auction last week for a record £42,700. Andrew Gray believes it's long overdue attention. ""I think Alasdair has been neglected over the years and I'm hoping this will being more international attention to his work,"" he said. ""The limelight that this film has shared onto his work is certainly going to promote his writing and his art. It's going to bring new readers back to the book."" And that's the hope they have at the National Library of Scotland which holds his literary archive. It includes handwritten notes, manuscripts, artworks and letters. There are three early versions of Poor Creatures, which would go on to become Poor Things. In the correspondence is a letter from Gray to Yorgos Lanthimos after his visit to Glasgow, wishing him the best for his film adaptation. Colin McIlroy, curator of modern literary manuscripts said: ""There are hundreds and hundreds of boxes. ""And it covers pretty much the working process for almost all of his written output: novels, short stories, dramas, radio adaptations, film scripts, diaries, and correspondence."" Some of the archive is available for consultation in the library's reading rooms but with 200 boxes, spanning a career of almost seven decades, the library is currently fundraising for a full time cataloguer. Chris Cassells, head of archives and manuscript collections at the library said: ""This is a collection of international significance - one of the biggest literary archives we have. ""We would very much hope that, given the amount of attention the film has received, given that it's really put Alasdair's name in the spotlight internationally, that people will watch the film before reading the book.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdll0ypenlo,Alan Cumming: I feel like Bond villain in US Traitors,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"".",2024-01-12,"Scottish actor Alan Cumming says working on the US version of The Traitors makes him feel like a ""James Bond villain"". Cumming, who actually appeared in 1995 Bond film Goldeneye, says the  producers of the reality show wanted him to ""camp it up"" and host it as an over-the-top character.So he adopts an eccentric Scottish accent, quotes Shakespeare and pokes fun at the contestants - but Cumming says he is still heavily invested in the drama which he watches on live feeds in his dressing room.""I can see them. I do feel like a James Bond villain,"" he says while laughing and stroking an imaginary cat, mimicking one of 007's most famous adversaries Ernst Blofeld.In fact Cumming says that when he accepted the role, he suggested that he could bring his dog to stroke menacingly instead.The idea was not taken up for the first series because his dog Lala could not travel to Scotland for the filming. ""My dog's in the second one,"" Cumming says with a smile. Season two of the US version of The Traitors is currently airing, at the same time as the UK version - hosted by Claudia Winkleman on BBC One.Both are filmed at Ardross Castle in Easter Ross and involve ""faithful"" contestants trying to discover and eliminate the traitors in their midst.Cumming hosts the US version wearing increasingly flamboyant costumes, with accessories added as each episode progresses.He tells BBC Scotland's The Edit his exaggerated Scottish accent is ""me playing Moira Rose from Schitt's Creek playing Alan Cumming"". Cumming says the US version is also different because the contestants are all celebrities to some degree, generally reality TV stars. ""It heightens the drama, they understand how to do drama,"" he says. While UK viewers may not be familiar with many of the celebrities, there is one they might recognise.John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of the more surprising contestants in the US show. Cumming says: ""It was fascinating to see what the Americans made of him because none of them knew who he was.""They thought he talked too much, and he did.""However, Cumming says: ""In the end, he became a team player."" He says he loved teasing Bercow during the filming of the show. ""It's hilarious, I loved bossing him about,"" Cumming says. ""Any opportunity to go, 'order, order, John,'."" Cumming, from Aberfeldy in Perthshire, made his acting debut in the 1980s and is perhaps best remembered in Scotland for the comedy series The High Life which he created with Forbes Masson.In the decades since he has appeared in dozens of films including Spy Kids and X-Men 2 as well as having a starring role in the US TV series The Good Wife.Now 58, Cumming is thinking more about ageing and it is the focus of his new solo tour, set to begin later this month, called Alan Cumming is Not Acting His Age.He describes the show as akin to an old-fashioned cabaret, featuring a performance filled with music and discussions covering a range of topics such as sex, death, and alcohol. Cumming says there are under-discussed positives to getting older.""You get wiser, you don't worry so much,"" he says. ""Wisdom is about realising life is a cyclical thing, the same things keep coming around. ""It's the same show with different costumes."" Cumming says realising this enables better decision-making later in life and being open to the possibility of new experiences.""We worship at the altar of youth,"" he says.""I talk about this in the show, why have we decided that something that is inevitable, inexorable, like ageing is the worst possible thing in the world?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p1rdzyg6mo,We're playing shinty for the first time in our 80s,The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll.,2024-01-12,"The traditional Scottish game of shinty is normally played by the fit young men and women of communities in the Highlands and Argyll. But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty. ""The amazing work of Shinty Memories Scotland and their cluster groups in bringing together older people to engage in the sport is truly inspiring.""However, Laurene has gone one step further - amazing.""","['Elderly people', 'Lochgilphead', 'Mental health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/b6ad/live/ab7bc9f0-af38-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/945/cpsprodpb/1c13/live/091d63d0-afb0-11ee-b3f7-fd8c6292139d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/970/cpsprodpb/2200/live/cb0e62a0-b0b9-11ee-ad9c-fd8d022d1d63.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/694/cpsprodpb/653a/live/33b07e40-af3b-11ee-a916-3396d6d92381.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/836/cpsprodpb/fdb4/live/f0466e50-b0b9-11ee-a40e-199b105537bc.jpg']","['Andreas Wolff', 'BBC Naidheachdan']",UK,Scotland

Warren Fenty, 20, from Aberdeen, died from a drugs overdose while in police custody in 2014. Sheriff Morag McLaughlin’s findings were due to be published this month, following a number of previous delays. But the Scottish Courts Service has confirmed that due to “personal health reasons” Sheriff McLaughlin can no longer produce the determination, and it will now be taken over by the Sheriff Principal of Grampian, Derek Pyle. Warren’s mother, Sharon Fenty, told BBC Scotland News:  “I just feel empty, let down and devastated. I can’t get my head around it.“I need answers, I’ve been waiting for answers for nearly ten years.“Does this mean that the whole thing will have to start again? I have so many questions. It feels like delay after delay.“There have been a lot of mistakes made. For the first couple of years or so it was just passed to the side. Then there was Covid. But I think it’s terrible that anyone has had to wait so long.”She added urgent changes were needed around the timings of FAIs to prevent other families going through the same experience. Mr Fenty died at Aberdeen’s Kittybrewster police station in June 2014. He had been arrested after discharging himself from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, against medical advice, and was being held in Kittybrewster’s custody suite. The inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death is currently the longest ongoing FAI in Scotland. A Judicial Office spokesperson said: “Sheriff principal Pyle, the sheriff principal of Grampian, Highland and Islands, has been monitoring progress of the preparation of sheriff McLaughlin’s determination in this inquiry over an extended period. “The sheriff principal will now take personal control of the inquiry and has offered to meet the family of Warren Fenty, if they so wish, to discuss the delay and its consequences.”The statement added: “The sheriff principal recognises that this is a very unsatisfactory situation and this step has been taken with great reluctance, recognising the harm which the delay to date has already done but also what yet more uncertainty will do to the interests of all parties to the inquiry, not least the family of the deceased. “He will fix a hearing as a matter of urgency for the participants to be given the opportunity to discuss the best way forward. Whatever is decided, the inquiry will be under his sole control, including the preparation of the final determination.” A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “The procurator fiscal will continue to support and provide assistance to the fatal accident inquiry as required. “We will continue to keep the Fenty family updated on any significant developments in relation to the inquiry.” Ms Fenty said she hoped to meet with sheriff Pyle within the next two weeks. “I’ve sat for nearly ten years waiting and waiting to find out what happened to my son. That is a hole that will never fill,” she said.“I don’t want another mother waiting ten years to find out why their child is not here anymore. “","['Police Scotland', 'Justice']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/840/cpsprodpb/8d86/live/d3df5dd0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/654/cpsprodpb/c633/live/ad665220-b178-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f405/live/4dce5b80-b17a-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0787/live/2d667bf0-abdc-11ee-b042-b1e5ed61b7e6.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/585/cpsprodpb/cee6/live/bfaf9090-b178-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg']","['Louise Hosie', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland

But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty. ""The amazing work of Shinty Memories Scotland and their cluster groups in bringing together older people to engage in the sport is truly inspiring.""However, Laurene has gone one step further - amazing.""","['Elderly people', 'Lochgilphead', 'Mental health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/b6ad/live/ab7bc9f0-af38-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/945/cpsprodpb/1c13/live/091d63d0-afb0-11ee-b3f7-fd8c6292139d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/970/cpsprodpb/2200/live/cb0e62a0-b0b9-11ee-ad9c-fd8d022d1d63.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/694/cpsprodpb/653a/live/33b07e40-af3b-11ee-a916-3396d6d92381.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/836/cpsprodpb/fdb4/live/f0466e50-b0b9-11ee-a40e-199b105537bc.jpg']","['Andreas Wolff', 'BBC Naidheachdan']",UK,Scotland

The MV Isle of Islay is then scheduled to arrive in Scotland in October this year and will serve Islay and Jura. The four ferries for CalMac routes are being built at the Cemre Marin Endustri shipyard in Yalovan. The work comes amidst continued frustration among island communities at the state of west coast services. Two late and over-budget ferries being built at the nationalised Ferguson Marine yard in Inverclyde, which were due to launch this spring, could face a further two-month delay. The Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa now have a price tag of at least £360m - compared to an initial estimate of £97m - for their construction at the yard in Port Glasgow. The Scottish Conservatives have described the potential delivery of Turkish-built vessels before those built on the Clyde as ""an astonishing humiliation for the SNP's original ferries strategy"". The Isle of Islay's Turkish-built sister ship, Loch Indaal, is estimated to be ready by February 2025. Both vessels will have capacity for up to 450 passengers and 100 cars. They will be followed by MV Claymore and MV Lochmor in June and October next year. Jim Anderson, director of vessels at CMAL, said the announcement of the Isle of Islay's launch in March marked a ""major milestone"" in its commitment to providing new ferries for islanders. He said: ""Work at the Cemre shipyard continues to progress well, with the project coming in on time and on budget."" Transport minister Fiona Hyslop said delivering six new vessels to serve Scotland's ferry network by 2026 was a priority for the Scottish government. She added: ""People will welcome a more resilient and modern ferry service for Islay and Jura, and further vessels will soon bring similar and highly-anticipated improvements for island communities across Scotland."" However, Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said: ""While this is great news for islanders, it is an astonishing humiliation for the SNP's original ferries strategy, which still hasn't delivered two vessels that are six years late and hugely over budget. ""I predicted that when the Turkish shipyard was awarded the contract to build the ferries that they may well be ready before the ill-fated ones being built at the Ferguson yard. That is, sadly, turning out to be the case.""","['Ferries', 'Shipbuilding', 'Isle of Jura', 'CalMac', 'Isle of Islay']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A850/production/_132288034_mvisleofislay.jpg'],,UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-67934473,The fight for the future of Rosefield Mills in Dumfries,The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon.,2024-01-12,"The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon. It was bought - to save it from total dereliction - by Dumfries Historic Buildings Trust (DHBT) in 2018. Since then, the group has been working at bringing parts of it back into use while looking at what the long-term future might hold. After more than five years - and a global pandemic - what stage has the project now reached? Richard Polley volunteers with the DHBT and said he was in no doubt that the property had been worth saving. ""I think it's an incredibly beautiful building,"" he said. ""The design is based on that of a Venetian palace - so I kind of now think of Dumfries as being the Venice of south-west Scotland. ""It's a huge building and was once one of five mills that were along the river in this part of Dumfries and this is now the only remaining part of that story."" He said it was designed to look beautiful on the river front but utilitarian behind that frontage. ""I think it's just so important not to lose that story of the mills in Dumfries that were a significant part of the prosperity of Dumfries and, of course, generated loads of employment here in the town,"" he said. ""This part of Dumfries would have been a real industrial centre and there's the potential to enliven it and to people it and make it part of the regeneration of Dumfries."" However, he admitted that it would take ""several million pounds"" to bring it back into full use but said the DHBT had plans for bringing it back into operation a little at a time. ""It's no good having a fancy scheme that costs so much to maintain and to operate - it has to be something that's sustainable,"" he explained. Luke Moloney, who chairs the trust, said they had made progress since buying the building, having gained support from a range of organisations. A workshop has been brought into use at the back of the building and two new spaces are now open for community or commercial uses. He accepts, however, that there is much more to be done. ""The building is colossal, I mean, it's 60 yards long and it's 12 yards deep - that's just the building on the river front and it's on two floors,"" he said. ""We've also got a similar-sized building on a single storey only running towards the back of the site. ""It's a huge amount of floor area and so that suggests a good mix of uses."" He said there were some ""wonderful"" and ""quite wacky"" ideas for its use that came out of community sessions and they were now examining the options. Among them might be an arts or archive centre. The idea of putting in a restaurant ""spilling out onto the river front"" is one that could have a key part to play. ""It would populate that space which could be a wonderful public space between the building and the water,"" he said. ""I think whatever happens that would be a necessary anchor."" Another option would be the potential for a cinema screen, studios and an exhibition or events space. ""There are lots of really good ideas and lots of interesting thoughts about it, which still need to be developed,"" said Mr Moloney. It all, of course, hinges on funding. ""I think we'd all like to think that in 10 years' time this building will be saved and in a mix of exciting uses,"" he said. ""But in terms of getting to the point where we have the money together and we know exactly what that mix will be I think we're looking optimistically at about a three-year process."" That would see a full-time development officer and support staff appointed to devote themselves to pulling the scheme together and attracting more support. In the shorter term, they have two projects taking place. On Friday evening, a Midwinter Light event will see lights switched on to illuminate the front of the building. Then, on Saturday, the public is invited to an open day between 11:00 and 15:00 to meet the group and share ideas of how to ensure Rosefield Mills flourishes. ""The river frontage is incredibly beautiful and everyone says we can't lose this, it's such a beautiful building,"" said Mr Moloney. ""I think there's a lot of affection for the building among the people of Dumfries, but also people who visit the town. ""We haven't given up yet, we're committed to finding a solution.""","['Architecture', 'Dumfries']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F61/production/_132275858_rosefieldmills.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17671/production/_132275859_richardpolley.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1AC9/production/_132275860_frontage.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/41D9/production/_132275861_lukemoloney.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/68E9/production/_132275862_riverside.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B709/production/_132275864_img_20180624_102408425.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6317/production/_132276352_rosefieldmllsbuilding.jpg']","['By Giancarlo Rinaldi', 'South Scotland reporter, BBC Scotland news website']",UK,Scotland

The death of a baby is an event no parent should endure, let alone in circumstances where - if there were different decisions, procedures, or knowledge - that baby may have survived. To then have the details of that personal tragedy made public is further trauma that no family would want. Mirabelle Bosch died at just 12 hours old on 2 July 2021 at Wishaw General Hospital. Ellie McCormick died at five hours old on 5 March 2019 at the same hospital. And Leo Lamont was two hours old when he died at Monklands Hospital on 15 February 2019. It is important that these deaths are not brushed off as isolated tragedies, and if there are common failings then they should be investigated to prevent anything like this from happening again. That is why three families who were anticipating a joyous turn in their lives are putting themselves through the distress of reliving their worst nightmare. This FAI was called by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service which has deemed it in the public interest for this inquiry to take place. Mirabelle, Leo and Ellie were all said to have died ""in circumstances giving rise to serious public concern"". The purpose of this FAI is not to apportion blame, but to establish what happened and prevent future deaths from happening in similar circumstances. A sheriff will hear evidence, and eventually issue a determination of their findings which can include recommendations. Sheriff Principle Aisha Anwar, who is leading this inquiry, is sensitive to the immense trauma suffered by each family. While there is no way to avoid the distressing detail of what happened, much of their evidence has been submitted as written affidavits to save them the ordeal of being questioned on it in court. All the parents were in court on the first day of the inquiry, but none have been there since. Although very little is known at this stage, it is clear that a key question families want answered is how and whether potential procedural or system errors contributed to their babies deaths. The inquiry is set out in three chapters, firstly looking at the circumstances around Mirabelle Bosch's death. Her father Eckhardt, told the inquiry they were ""led into a dark tunnel"" by ""misguided"" instructions which gave them a ""wrong sense of security"". They had believed everything with the pregnancy was normal, with antenatal checks suggesting the baby was healthy and developing as it should. But the court heard that despite a 31-week scan recording the baby as completely breech, three subsequent midwife examinations recorded it as being in a head down, cephalic position. This is the position that typically allows for the smoothest delivery. Even when Rozelle Bosch's waters broke suddenly on 30 June 2021 and she was examined in hospital, the midwife sent her home to wait for labour to advance. Mirabelle was considered a ""low-risk"" pregnancy and midwife Michelle Tannahill told the inquiry this week she saw ""no red flags"" upon her examination. ""Everything I had found that night was within the scope of my practice within midwifery. There wasn't anything concerning,"" she said. The details of what happened next are extremely distressing. Husband Eckhardt Bosch said he still feels the trauma in his body over the night of 1 July. After going into active labour at home, paramedics were called but a catalogue of delays ensued. It took five attempts to call the maternity unit at Wishaw General Hospital before anybody answered the phone, and paramedics were unable to deliver the baby themselves. Mirabelle's head was stuck and by the time mother and baby were taken to hospital, her chances of survival were very slim. She died hours later in her mother's arms. The post-mortem later noted that if the breech position had been recognised earlier in the pregnancy, then Rozelle would have likely been classified as a higher risk where a management plan for a hospital birth would have been arranged and the outcome may have been different. The pathologist also concluded if there had not been such a long delays transporting the patient to hospital, she may also have stood a chance of survival. Evidence has been heard from health professionals involved in Mirabelle's death, with expert witnesses who were not directly involved in the case to follow. The FAI will then examine the deaths of Ellie McCormick and Leo Lamont. At this point there is no indication that health professionals in Mirabelle's case had not followed the protocols or procedures in place at the time. However, there have been questions about whether software used to record details of the pregnancy may not have alerted those involved of potential risks, or may have some limitations in the information it can hold. Issues around the subjectivity of deciding whether a baby is engaged in early pregnancy, and how clear instructions are to mothers on when they come into hospital, have also been discussed. These areas are likely to be explored further when the inquiry examines the circumstances around the deaths of Leo and Ellie. Speaking to BBC Scotland News, the McCormick family lawyer said they believe Ellie's death was entirely avoidable. Darren Deery, a specialist in medical negligence law, said: ""The family's understanding is that there were potential defects in the system, in that certain risk factors weren't highlighted in the way they could, and should, have been. ""And had the subsequent midwifery and obstetrics staff been aware of those risks, a different course of action would have been taken and the outcome may well have been different."" Ultimately there will be no blame placed here, but it will look in detail at what happened in each case, considering whether systems were at fault, whether individual or collective errors were involved and it will establish what steps, if any, might be taken to prevent other children dying in similar circumstances.","['NHS Lanarkshire', 'Wishaw', 'Pregnancy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15301/production/_132258768_gettyimages-640974708.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9399/production/_132258773_spin-babiesfaiglasgowsheriff-002.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D49C/production/_132282445_faibabyrantwithdepartures.1_frame_1057.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1BC2/production/_132260170_faibabydeathlawyer_frame_3989.jpg']","['By Lisa Summers', 'Scotland Health Correspondent']",UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67748637,I noticed a bulging lump sensation in my vagina,When Natashja Wilson first noticed she had symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse she had no idea what was happening and was too embarrassed to ask for help.,2024-01-12,"When Natashja Wilson first noticed she had symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse she had no idea what was happening and was too embarrassed to ask for help. Aged just 18 and living away from home at university, she had never heard of the condition which could affect up to 50% of women during their lifetime. ""I noticed when I went to the toilet a bulge was coming out of my vagina,"" she said. ""I was also experiencing incontinence and pain during intercourse and a bulging feeling. ""I didn't really know what to think because I honestly knew nothing about my body at that time."" Natashja, now 24, says she did not know what her pelvic floor or her cervix were at the time. ""So I asked my friends 'Is this bulging lump sensation normal?',"" she said. ""They said, 'Maybe it's your G-spot. Maybe it's just a spot'."" Natashja, from Greenwich in London, didn't know what to think so she left it and hoped it would go away with time. But her symptoms got worse and after 18 months she finally confided in her mum who persuaded her to see a doctor. It was later confirmed she had uterine prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the group of muscles and tissues that normally support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened and cannot hold the organs firmly in place. It causes one or more of the organs to move down from their normal position, leading to a bulge that can be felt inside or outside the vagina. This can be the womb, bowel, bladder or top of the vagina. Many women are unaware they have a prolapse or only have mild symptoms, but for some it can have a real impact on their quality of life. Symptoms can include a heavy dragging sensation or feeling of something coming down the vagina - which is sometimes described like a feeling of 'sitting on a tennis ball' as well as bladder and bowel issues and discomfort during sex. Pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help to improve symptoms, but sometimes medical treatment is needed such as vaginal pessaries or surgery. Causes of prolapse include genetics, heavy lifting, constipation or a persistent cough. Pregnancy and childbirth increase the risk of prolapse, particularly after a difficult labour. Women are also more likely to develop prolapse as they get older, especially after the menopause. But Natashja is keen to make people aware it can affect younger people too. She is trying to lift the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse through social media and her blog 'Living With Prolapse'. ""There's still so much stigma around prolapse, around discussing your genitalia and that doesn't allow for people to go see a doctor,"" she said. ""I know that if there was less stigma I would've gone to a doctor much earlier."" The stories of women hoping to left the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse. Watch now on BBC iPlayer According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) one in 12 women report symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse but on examination it is present in up to 50% of all women. Research yet to be published by Stirling University indicates that embarrassment, lack of awareness and a fear that symptoms won't be taken seriously, all act as barriers to women seeking help for pelvic health problems. The study looked at papers from 24 countries including the UK over the past 20 years, taking in the views of more than 20,000 women. Researchers Clare Jouanny and Dr Purva Abhyankar said: ""There is a large body of evidence from the UK and similar countries across the world that women still face many barriers when it comes to seeking help for women's health issues like prolapse. ""We need to focus not only on increasing awareness and education among women and clinicians, but more importantly we need to work with clinicians to change women's perception that clinicians don't take them seriously with pelvic health symptoms."" Pelvic health physiotherapist Suzanne Vernazza is on a mission to educate women about their pelvic health. She is the founder of the not-for-profit company Know Your Floors and her daily 'SqueezeAlong' pelvic floor exercise tutorials have more than 600,000 followers on TikTok. She says it is important for people to raise pelvic health concerns with their GP. ""If you've been feeling something that at any point doesn't feel quite right, whether you're pregnant or postnatal, raise it and ask the question because more than likely, you're right that it's not right - and you can have support for you to be able to manage that,"" she said. The Royal College of GPs said its doctors are well trained to diagnose and care for people affected by prolapse. RCGP Scotland deputy chairman Dr Chris Williams said: ""GPs are aware of the embarrassment or stigma that can be associated with this condition and strive to ensure women feel comfortable and empowered to seek support if experiencing symptoms."" Sam Hindle experienced bladder prolapse after the birth of her son 24 years ago and has been incontinent ever since. ""It was that bad that my two-year-old son was having to go and fetch mummy clean pants, clean trousers,"" she said.  ""It was embarrassing to have your two-year-old run about and say ' Oh Mummy's had an accident, I need to help'.'"" The 47-year-old, from Edinburgh, was one of tens of thousands of women in the UK to have transvaginal mesh surgery to treat prolapse and incontinence. Its use was halted in the UK in 2018 due to the life-changing side-effects many women suffered. Sam said she had been left in constant pain and suffers from PTSD as a result of the procedure. She hopes to have her mesh removed by a specialist in the United States and is currently on a waiting list for assessment in Glasgow. She said it was important for people to talk about pelvic health. ""Just like menopause, it's a subject that we need to remove the stigma of and talk about and let people not feel embarrassed about this so they will go and seek help,"" she said. ""You look at other females in the family who are having children and you think, 'Oh I'd better warn them, I better make sure they know about pelvic floor exercises and they know how to avoid possibly getting into the mess I did with bladder prolapse."" Natashja said prolapse affects women of all ages and it does not discriminate. ""I noticed my symptoms when I was 18 and when I went on Google it was only telling me that elderly women were impacted,"" she said. ""The doctors were so shocked that someone of my age had prolapse and it made me feel very isolated."" Natashja said she is now feeling positive about the future. She has been working with a pelvic health physiotherapist and uses a vaginal pessary, a device that helps to support the vaginal walls and pelvic organs, which means she feels more confident doing exercise. She said the support and advice of the online community had also helped her to cope. ""If you have just been diagnosed with prolapse, it's important to know you do not have to go through this alone,"" she said. ""There is an army of women out there willing to support you and help you through your journey and they can understand what you're going through and help you through it.""","['Health', ""Women's health"", 'Women']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0B2E/production/_132126820_female_anatomy_2x_640-nc-002.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0253/production/_124659500_generic_banner_top.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/105E8/production/_132084076_index_promo_prolapse.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2BC/production/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15020/production/_132084068_suzannepic1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/69A8/production/_132084072_sampic.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0030/production/_132084000_natasha2.jpg']","['By Hayley Jarvis', 'BBC Scotland reporter']",UK,Scotland

The first tribunal ruled Sheriff Jack Brown's conduct toward a woman known as X was ""entirely inappropriate"" but did not justify his removal from office. X said evidence from two women making similar claims should have been heard. Mr Brown has been suspended on full pay since the allegations came to light in 2018. Judge Lord Woolman said the original tribunal had proceeded in ""ignorance of the availability of other evidence"". The new tribunal was constituted in 2022 by then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the request of the Lord President. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""Sheriff Jack Brown is subject to ongoing Fitness for Judicial Office Tribunal proceedings. ""Once the tribunal has made its decision, ministers will lay the tribunal's report before the Scottish Parliament in line with duties set out in the Court Reform (Scotland) Act 2014."" X, who is a lawyer, had raised judicial review proceedings to quash the decision of the original fitness for office tribunal, which was the first of its kind to be carried out in Scotland. The fitness for judicial office tribunal issued its decision in March 2021. It found that Mr Brown's behaviour had been ""entirely inappropriate"" and that he had ""failed to respect proper professional boundaries"". X had alleged inappropriate and unwelcome physical contact towards her, including a claim that he touched her bottom. The tribunal upheld one allegation, that Mr Brown had hugged X and made a remark towards her. But it said the other allegations had not been established on the balance of probabilities. Mr Brown was arrested and charged in relation to the allegations in January 2019, but prosecutors dropped the case three months later. He was appointed to the sheriffdom of Aberdeen in 2016. Mr Brown set up his own legal practice in Dundee in 1996, and has been a sheriff since 2005. An order granting his anonymity in the judicial review hearing was lifted following a successful challenge by BBC Scotland. During the judicial review hearing, X's legal team said there was a ""real possibility"" that the tribunal's decision would have been different if the other women's evidence had been made available to it. Mr Brown's lawyer argued that X's petition was ""no more than an invitation to the court to allow the petitioner to 'have another go' on the entirely speculative basis that a different outcome might be possible"".","['Aberdeen', 'Dundee']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/19C4/production/_132269560_20181112_sheriff_jack_brown_001.jpg'],"['By Graeme Ogston', 'BBC Scotland Tayside and Central reporter']",UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6p119e02v9o,'Confusing' bus gates concerning city shop owners,,2024-01-12,"Restricting some roads in Aberdeen to buses is driving customers away from city centre businesses, according to some businesses. The concerns follow this month's closure of Haigs Food Hall in Schoolhill which had operated for 12 years. The bus priority routes in the city centre were implemented in August last year. Council co-leader Ian Yuill said footfall was recovering and bus passenger numbers had increased. The restrictions, called bus gates, were introduced to reduce the amount of general traffic on Market Street, Guild Street, Union Street and Bridge Street.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) described the measures as a ""challenge"" for those wanting to come into the city centre. Jamie Stewart, the owner of Belmont Street gift shop Juniper, said customer numbers over Christmas and early 2024 were lower than the previous year when they were still feeling the impact of the pandemic. He said customers from the outskirts of the city or Aberdeenshire were being put off by the ""confusing"" bus measures. He said: ""Bus gates seem to be the main issue, it's a fear factor. ""Where do you go? What do you do?""I just don't think our city centre is built in a way that it really works. ""There's a lot less cars in the car parks, and that doesn't mean more people are getting the bus."" Mr Stewart said the closure of smaller shops like Haigs and larger stores such as John Lewis was concerning. He said what pulled people into the city centre were shops, adding: ""You need lots of different shops."" Mike Duncan, FSB north-east development manager, said the restrictions went against the aim of attracting people to the city centre. He said: ""That's what small businesses are concerned about, it is easier to do something else rather than come to Aberdeen city centre. ""The council has a lot of work to do.""He added high business rates and energy costs were putting a strain on businesses. Council co-leader, Liberal Democrat Ian Yuill, said he will meet with the FSB to discuss their concerns but admitted it was too early to make a decision on bus gates. He added: ""What is quite clear is the reliability of bus services has improved and the number of passengers has increased. ""But as you know, Aberdeen City Council like others in Scotland does not set business rates.""","['Aberdeen', 'Federation of Small Businesses (Scotland)']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/2efb/live/74dbcdd0-b156-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/925/cpsprodpb/ffaf/live/09046500-b15a-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/b7fc/live/2c097600-b158-11ee-b2db-5921d7fb1370.jpg']","['Robbie Boyle', 'BBC Scotland News']",UK,Scotland

The death of a baby is an event no parent should endure, let alone in circumstances where - if there were different decisions, procedures, or knowledge - that baby may have survived. To then have the details of that personal tragedy made public is further trauma that no family would want. Mirabelle Bosch died at just 12 hours old on 2 July 2021 at Wishaw General Hospital. Ellie McCormick died at five hours old on 5 March 2019 at the same hospital. And Leo Lamont was two hours old when he died at Monklands Hospital on 15 February 2019. It is important that these deaths are not brushed off as isolated tragedies, and if there are common failings then they should be investigated to prevent anything like this from happening again. That is why three families who were anticipating a joyous turn in their lives are putting themselves through the distress of reliving their worst nightmare. This FAI was called by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service which has deemed it in the public interest for this inquiry to take place. Mirabelle, Leo and Ellie were all said to have died ""in circumstances giving rise to serious public concern"". The purpose of this FAI is not to apportion blame, but to establish what happened and prevent future deaths from happening in similar circumstances. A sheriff will hear evidence, and eventually issue a determination of their findings which can include recommendations. Sheriff Principle Aisha Anwar, who is leading this inquiry, is sensitive to the immense trauma suffered by each family. While there is no way to avoid the distressing detail of what happened, much of their evidence has been submitted as written affidavits to save them the ordeal of being questioned on it in court.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-67934473,The fight for the future of Rosefield Mills in Dumfries,The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon.,2024-01-12,"The Rosefield Mills building on the banks of the River Nith still looks striking on a cold winter afternoon. It was bought - to save it from total dereliction - by Dumfries Historic Buildings Trust (DHBT) in 2018. Since then, the group has been working at bringing parts of it back into use while looking at what the long-term future might hold. After more than five years - and a global pandemic - what stage has the project now reached? Richard Polley volunteers with the DHBT and said he was in no doubt that the property had been worth saving. ""I think it's an incredibly beautiful building,"" he said. ""The design is based on that of a Venetian palace - so I kind of now think of Dumfries as being the Venice of south-west Scotland. ""It's a huge building and was once one of five mills that were along the river in this part of Dumfries and this is now the only remaining part of that story."" He said it was designed to look beautiful on the river front but utilitarian behind that frontage. ""I think it's just so important not to lose that story of the mills in Dumfries that were a significant part of the prosperity of Dumfries and, of course, generated loads of employment here in the town,"" he said. ""This part of Dumfries would have been a real industrial centre and there's the potential to enliven it and to people it and make it part of the regeneration of Dumfries."" However, he admitted that it would take ""several million pounds"" to bring it back into full use but said the DHBT had plans for bringing it back into operation a little at a time. ""It's no good having a fancy scheme that costs so much to maintain and to operate - it has to be something that's sustainable,"" he explained. Luke Moloney, who chairs the trust, said they had made progress since buying the building, having gained support from a range of organisations. A workshop has been brought into use at the back of the building and two new spaces are now open for community or commercial uses. He accepts, however, that there is much more to be done. ""The building is colossal, I mean, it's 60 yards long and it's 12 yards deep - that's just the building on the river front and it's on two floors,"" he said. ""We've also got a similar-sized building on a single storey only running towards the back of the site. ""It's a huge amount of floor area and so that suggests a good mix of uses."" He said there were some ""wonderful"" and ""quite wacky"" ideas for its use that came out of community sessions and they were now examining the options. Among them might be an arts or archive centre. The idea of putting in a restaurant ""spilling out onto the river front"" is one that could have a key part to play. ""It would populate that space which could be a wonderful public space between the building and the water,"" he said. ""I think whatever happens that would be a necessary anchor."" Another option would be the potential for a cinema screen, studios and an exhibition or events space. ""There are lots of really good ideas and lots of interesting thoughts about it, which still need to be developed,"" said Mr Moloney. It all, of course, hinges on funding. ""I think we'd all like to think that in 10 years' time this building will be saved and in a mix of exciting uses,"" he said. ""But in terms of getting to the point where we have the money together and we know exactly what that mix will be I think we're looking optimistically at about a three-year process."" That would see a full-time development officer and support staff appointed to devote themselves to pulling the scheme together and attracting more support. In the shorter term, they have two projects taking place. On Friday evening, a Midwinter Light event will see lights switched on to illuminate the front of the building. Then, on Saturday, the public is invited to an open day between 11:00 and 15:00 to meet the group and share ideas of how to ensure Rosefield Mills flourishes.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67937404,Party: The new-style nightclub that's only open in the day,"If you like a night out but are known to nod off at a bar when it gets late, the day-time nightclub may be for you.",2024-01-12,"If you like a night out but are known to nod off at a bar when it gets late, the day-time nightclub may be for you. Actress Vicky McClure and husband Jonny Owen have created a club night that's open in the day but shuts early so you can get a kebab, the last train and be home for some Saturday night telly. The idea is you'll be fresh to take the kids to their clubs the next morning. ""Instead of dancing the night away, this is dancing the afternoon away,"" joked Line of Duty star Vicky. As a nod to the Bee Gees' party classic Night Fever, the all-day discos are called Day Fever where its more ""all day long"" than ""all night long"". ""It's a nightclub in the afternoon for people of a certain age,"" said filmmaker Jonny, 52. ""I love meeting mates, having a few drinks, having a dance but also like getting a cheeky curry afterwards, not queuing hours for a taxi and being home early enough for Match of the Day - and then it also doesn't ruin your Sunday either. ""For me now, it's all about going out on a bit of an all-dayer - and I thought there's a real market for people with a similar vibe."" The discos are targeted at people over 30, where doors open at 14:00, last entry is 16:00 and party-goers are asked to be polite and encouraged to dress smart like they used to when they went on a night out clubbing. ""I'm really guilty for having a good dance in my kitchen alone - and I would much rather do it with my friends,"" Bafta winner Vicky said. ""Music is such a powerful thing for us all to have, it's one thing playing it in your headphones, your house or in your car but you're on a dance floor, with your mates it really does create a memory - and I'm all for music and memories as we do with our dementia choir."" DJs at their event can include Vicky herself, Jonny, and his daughter Radio 1 presenter Katie Owen who pick from classic party anthems chosen by DJ and Reverend and the Makers frontman Jon McClure. Their first day-time disco experiment in Sheffield City Hall last month sold out within 48 hours where Vicky and mum Carol led the dance floor charge. ""It started in a classic way where everybody stood round the edge of the dance floor,"" said the Trigger Point and Without Sin actress, who had recently been honoured by the King. ""But me and mum were the first two up dancing and it didn't take long before everybody followed - and it was completely packed."" Daytime dances have now been confirmed in London, Nottingham and south Wales as well as a return to Sheffield and organisers want to take their drop-in disco to towns and cities across the UK. ""We'd love to see it in different cities so everyone has access and we're getting loads of messages on our social media asking us to bring it to them,"" she added. ""And having it on your doorstep, close to your home is the whole point so you don't have to make late-night trips on the train, we want to make sure it's accessible to everybody. ""We've got to be really fair about ticket prices because we appreciate the world in which we live in and people want to be able to come and have a great time so we've got to make it affordable to everybody."" Vicky and Jonny's daytime disco includes a nostalgia fix on the big screens which includes clips from old school TV shows and films as well as retro television adverts. ""I'm terrible for scrolling down a nostalgia rabbit hole as we all love that once you get to a certain age,"" added Vicky, 40. An investigation by BBC Newsbeat found that more than half of all UK clubs shut down between 2005 and 2015 and Jonny wants to show that some people still want to dance and party, just a bit earlier than used to. Three of their next events - in Sheffield, Merthyr Tydfil and Nottingham - have already sold out while tickets for their day-time disco in London's Outernet in March are selling well, they said. ""It's better than going to the gym if we're going down the January new year's resolution route,"" said Vicky with a smile.

The Welsh government said it was giving £134m in rates support next year on top of permanent schemes worth £250m. In the draft budget in December, as well as announcing plans to slash rate relief from 75% to 40%, it said business rates would rise 5%. In England rate relief will remain 75%. UK Hospitality said a typical Welsh pub or restaurant could now pay an average £6,800 more than similar businesses in England. Cardiff pub and restaurant owner Cerys Furlong said businesses were facing pressures on all fronts. Her own food and energy costs had more than doubled, she said, adding that the UK's 20% VAT rate was one of Europe's highest. Cutting rate relief, she believes, would damage the hospitality sector - responsible for 8.5% of UK jobs and branded the plan ""short sighted"". ""It would be interesting to see what analysis they've done on the impact it would have on jobs and business failures,"" she said. Simon Wright has 35 years experience in hospitality and said the situation was the worst he had faced. ""I do think Welsh government will want to look again at their draft budget,"" he said. ""The idea you're going to raise more money from businesses is reliant on those businesses actually existing.""

The idea is you'll be fresh to take the kids to their clubs the next morning. ""Instead of dancing the night away, this is dancing the afternoon away,"" joked Line of Duty star Vicky. As a nod to the Bee Gees' party classic Night Fever, the all-day discos are called Day Fever where its more ""all day long"" than ""all night long"". ""It's a nightclub in the afternoon for people of a certain age,"" said filmmaker Jonny, 52. ""I love meeting mates, having a few drinks, having a dance but also like getting a cheeky curry afterwards, not queuing hours for a taxi and being home early enough for Match of the Day - and then it also doesn't ruin your Sunday either.

The discos are targeted at people over 30, where doors open at 14:00, last entry is 16:00 and party-goers are asked to be polite and encouraged to dress smart like they used to when they went on a night out clubbing.

""Music is such a powerful thing for us all to have, it's one thing playing it in your headphones, your house or in your car but you're on a dance floor, with your mates it really does create a memory - and I'm all for music and memories as we do with our dementia choir."" DJs at their event can include Vicky herself, Jonny, and his daughter Radio 1 presenter Katie Owen who pick from classic party anthems chosen by DJ and Reverend and the Makers frontman Jon McClure. Their first day-time disco experiment in Sheffield City Hall last month sold out within 48 hours where Vicky and mum Carol led the dance floor charge.

It means each of the 37 spaces at the pay and display site on Monmouth's Wyebridge Street has cost the taxpayer more than £23,500. The original estimated cost is unclear but it was expected last year that it would be just over £500,000. Monmouthshire council blamed ground conditions and inflation for the extra expense. It has not revealed how much the car park was originally expected to cost, but last May a council official said in emails to Monmouth MP David Davies that the authority was ready to spend £520,000. Mr Davies accepted the car park was important for the town so it could attract more shoppers, but said he was ""surprised"" by the cost and length of time it had taken. He said: ""I must question the cost, which seems extraordinarily high for what should be a fairly straightforward construction project. ""While I appreciate there needs to be excavation work, ground levelling and drainage pipework et cetera, even a cost of £500,000 seems over the odds. ""But to then soar to £870,000 in just over six months is astonishing."" The council insisted the overspend was within the Highways' overall budget. A spokesman said: ""There is always a risk of unforeseen costs when engineering works are undertaken in the centre of historic towns with the unpredictable potential for previous installations lying beneath the surface. ""The difficult ground conditions and additional drainage requirements, which included relocating an uncharted sewer and revising the drainage scheme accordingly, along with unprecedented inflationary cost experienced throughout the construction industry, have significantly increased the scheme's cost and delayed completion."" The authority said the car park was almost finished and would open soon.","['Wales', 'Monmouthshire County Council', 'Monmouth']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1668C/production/_132288719_photo-2024-01-11-15-22-38-1.jpg'],,UK,Wales

The court previously heard Mr Brown attacked Corrine Brown, 33, as she comforted their 18-month-old child in the toddler's bedroom. Judge Jenkins thanked the jurors for their time and gave the prosecution until 26 January to decide whether to seek a retrial on the attempted murder charge.

Christopher Kapessa died after the incident in the River Cynon at Fernhill, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in 2019. The teenager, who was 14 at the time and cannot be named for legal reasons, denied walking behind Christopher and intentionally pushing him in. He told the inquest in Pontypridd that Christopher was ""excited to go in but he couldn't swim very good"". He said he knew Christopher through school but had not known him long. On 1 July 2019, a group of young people had arranged a visit to an area known as the red bridge, he told the coroner. He said he saw Christopher getting changed on the bridge while other boys jumped in. South Wales Central Coroner's Court heard he had jumped in himself and the water was too deep to stand up in, adding he felt scared and nervous the current might take him. He said he was close behind Christopher immediately before he entered the water and ""fell into him"". Christopher was immediately in the water after the physical contact, he said. When asked if he intentionally pushed Christopher into the water with the palms of his hands, he replied ""no"". The teenager said he ""couldn't remember"" who else had gone into the water after Christopher had gone in. The inquest had previously heard evidence from Killian Haslam, 18, who had been one of the boys at the river on the day of Christopher's death. Mr Haslam had told the inquest that the other teenager was standing behind Christopher and asked ""Shall I push him?"". Asked whether he had told Mr Haslam that he would push Christopher into the water ""as a joke"", the teenager replied: ""No."" The teenager was questioned further by Michael Mansfield, the barrister representing Christopher's family. Asked how he had come into contact with Christopher, causing him to fall in, the teenager said that he was ""coming down from the bridge… and I slipped into him"". Mr Mansfield asked: ""How are you moving between the bridge and Christopher?"" The teenager responded: ""Not walking, but not running - at a fast moving pace."" Asked whether he had said anything to anybody before going down to Christopher, the teenager replied: ""I said to Chris 'wait there, I'll come down and jump in with you now'."" He was then asked by Mr Mansfield why none of those who were present on the day had given the same version of events as him in their evidence. Mr Mansfield said: ""That must have made you wonder about the truth, has it?"" The teenager replied: ""No."" ""Would you reconsider right now as to whether the truth really is that you pushed him, deliberately?"" asked Mr Mansfield. ""The truth is that you did push him in, whether as a joke or messing about, that's what you did to get him in the water?"" ""No,"" replied the teenager. ""There was contact, but I did not push him in."" The teenager also denied that there had been a sporting ""rivalry"" between himself and Christopher, which would have led him to being ""full of himself"" when he'd already jumped in the river and Christopher had not.

Unite said its members at Cardiff council, who have been on strike since 28 December,  will not finish their action on 25 January as intended, but will continue until 22 February. This is over a lack of progress by the council on issues such as widespread bullying and agency labour, it said. Cardiff council described the move as ""very disappointing and unnecessary"". Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said: ""Rather than seeking to resolve this strike, Cardiff council seem intent on worsening industrial relations. ""The council's priority should be dealing with the bullying culture within the refuse and recycling department and ending the practice of workers waiting four years for a permanent employment contract."" Unite members have entered their 14th week of industrial action since September 2023. Cardiff council said it had ""attempted to respond positively and has sought to find a way forward"" with Unite. It said it has offered, among other things, to conduct an investigation into Unite's bullying claims, review pay scales, work through pay issues and review its disciplinary policy.

But a floodlight? That's what Max Mckeown chose when he went under the needle. As you might expect, the inked tribute permanently etched on the 23-year-old's calf isn't just any old floodlight. It's the 150ft (45m) tall giant that sits at the north-eastern corner of Swansea Rugby Club's St Helens stadium. According to local legend, it's the tallest freestanding floodlight in Europe. And Max, who lives in Cardiff, says his love affair with the leviathan lantern started when it saved him on the way back to a mate's from a night out. He says he'd found himself lost and alone in Swansea with no phone, and made the ""rather silly decision"" to get back by himself despite not knowing the area. Then he remembered his destination was right next to the rugby club. ""I kept on wandering around until eventually towering above all the houses, much like the North Star, I saw the big light of St Helens ground,"" he says. ""Like the wise men to Bethlehem, it guided me home."" From then on, according to Max, the light became ""a bit of a personality trait"", one that he even made a key feature of his dating profile at the time. ""My girlfriend ended up swiping right on it and we've been dating for two-and-half years,"" he says. But while the light story became a useful icebreaker at parties, Max says he realised it might be time to ""put the joke to bed"" when his Instagram was ""pretty much filled with wall-to-wall lights content"". ""Frankly, I was bored of it,"" he says. ""I thought 'I need a punchline. I need a conclusion'. ""And what better punchline or conclusion than just to get it on me permanently?"" Max says he's ""not a fan of tattoos"" but decided to get the black-and-white design, showing the floodlight looming over rooftops inked in 2021. His decision was partly down to the impressive claim that the structure is ""Europe's tallest freestanding light"". But is that actually true? According to David Dow from Swansea RFC, the height would have been hard to beat when it was first erected in 1964. ""Whether this claim still stands is debatable, but it is possible because most newer floodlights do not emanate from a freestanding tower,"" he told Newsbeat. So, what will Max do if it turns out the light isn't quite the record-breaker he thought it was? He says: ""I'll probably get a tattoo on the other leg with a footnote, an asterisk or something that says 'one of the tallest'."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter.

It means each of the 37 spaces at the pay and display site on Monmouth's Wyebridge Street has cost the taxpayer more than £23,500. The original estimated cost is unclear but it was expected last year that it would be just over £500,000. Monmouthshire council blamed ground conditions and inflation for the extra expense. It has not revealed how much the car park was originally expected to cost, but last May a council official said in emails to Monmouth MP David Davies that the authority was ready to spend £520,000. Mr Davies accepted the car park was important for the town so it could attract more shoppers, but said he was ""surprised"" by the cost and length of time it had taken. He said: ""I must question the cost, which seems extraordinarily high for what should be a fairly straightforward construction project. ""While I appreciate there needs to be excavation work, ground levelling and drainage pipework et cetera, even a cost of £500,000 seems over the odds. ""But to then soar to £870,000 in just over six months is astonishing."" The council insisted the overspend was within the Highways' overall budget. A spokesman said: ""There is always a risk of unforeseen costs when engineering works are undertaken in the centre of historic towns with the unpredictable potential for previous installations lying beneath the surface. ""The difficult ground conditions and additional drainage requirements, which included relocating an uncharted sewer and revising the drainage scheme accordingly, along with unprecedented inflationary cost experienced throughout the construction industry, have significantly increased the scheme's cost and delayed completion."" The authority said the car park was almost finished and would open soon.","['Wales', 'Monmouthshire County Council', 'Monmouth']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1668C/production/_132288719_photo-2024-01-11-15-22-38-1.jpg'],,UK,Wales

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67956926,Christopher Kapessa: Teen denies pushing boy into river,"A teenager has denied pushing a boy into a river before he drowned, saying he ""fell into"" him.",2024-01-12,"A teenager has denied pushing a boy into a river before he drowned, saying he ""fell into"" him. Christopher Kapessa died after the incident in the River Cynon at Fernhill, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in 2019. The teenager, who was 14 at the time and cannot be named for legal reasons, denied walking behind Christopher and intentionally pushing him in. He told the inquest in Pontypridd that Christopher was ""excited to go in but he couldn't swim very good"". He said he knew Christopher through school but had not known him long. On 1 July 2019, a group of young people had arranged a visit to an area known as the red bridge, he told the coroner. He said he saw Christopher getting changed on the bridge while other boys jumped in. South Wales Central Coroner's Court heard he had jumped in himself and the water was too deep to stand up in, adding he felt scared and nervous the current might take him. He said he was close behind Christopher immediately before he entered the water and ""fell into him"". Christopher was immediately in the water after the physical contact, he said. When asked if he intentionally pushed Christopher into the water with the palms of his hands, he replied ""no"". The teenager said he ""couldn't remember"" who else had gone into the water after Christopher had gone in. The inquest had previously heard evidence from Killian Haslam, 18, who had been one of the boys at the river on the day of Christopher's death. Mr Haslam had told the inquest that the other teenager was standing behind Christopher and asked ""Shall I push him?"". Asked whether he had told Mr Haslam that he would push Christopher into the water ""as a joke"", the teenager replied: ""No."" The teenager was questioned further by Michael Mansfield, the barrister representing Christopher's family. Asked how he had come into contact with Christopher, causing him to fall in, the teenager said that he was ""coming down from the bridge… and I slipped into him"". Mr Mansfield asked: ""How are you moving between the bridge and Christopher?"" The teenager responded: ""Not walking, but not running - at a fast moving pace."" Asked whether he had said anything to anybody before going down to Christopher, the teenager replied: ""I said to Chris 'wait there, I'll come down and jump in with you now'."" He was then asked by Mr Mansfield why none of those who were present on the day had given the same version of events as him in their evidence. Mr Mansfield said: ""That must have made you wonder about the truth, has it?"" The teenager replied: ""No."" ""Would you reconsider right now as to whether the truth really is that you pushed him, deliberately?"" asked Mr Mansfield. ""The truth is that you did push him in, whether as a joke or messing about, that's what you did to get him in the water?"" ""No,"" replied the teenager. ""There was contact, but I did not push him in."" The teenager also denied that there had been a sporting ""rivalry"" between himself and Christopher, which would have led him to being ""full of himself"" when he'd already jumped in the river and Christopher had not. The inquest continues.","['Wales', 'Mountain Ash']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A661/production/_108039524_ecb9fdb0-6fd0-4a06-92f1-2d8684f65255.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0B51/production/_108079820_kapessa1.jpg']","['By Stephen Fairclough', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

Carol Gravenor, 67, from Coed Main, Caerphilly, admitted six animal welfare offences after 26 birds were rescued from her sanctuary. A peregrine falcon with a missing eye was found in a filthy cage too small to spread its wings, the RSPCA said. It had to be put down along with 20 others. Warning: This story contains images of animal cruelty The Caerphilly Bird Rescue, a well-known charity for bird rehabilitation in south Wales, was run by Mrs Gravenor and her husband Ray until his death in 2021. In a written statement heard by Newport Magistrates' Court, RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben described unhygienic and hazardous conditions found during an inspection of the centre in April 2023 The wild birds found included pigeons, blackbirds, crows, jackdaws, a peregrine falcon and a common buzzard. Some were living in a kitchen inside the property, he said, while others were loose in the garden and some were caged in sheds, and 20 were found dead. ""There were many empty soiled bird cages piled on top of each other in the garden,"" he said. ""In the back garden were several pigeons walking around that looked to have dropped wings along with some domestic ducks, a domestic goose and a chicken that was obviously lame. ""We were invited into the house and on the kitchen table were two fledgling blackbirds and a nestling pigeon."" A cardboard box on a kitchen unit also held Jackdaw with an injured eye. Mr Hogben said he found ""a peregrine falcon bird with its left eye missing"" in a shed. ""The environment was poor with no water and a filthy cage which was too small for the falcon to spread its wings in all directions. ""Within two feet [0.6m] of this cage containing the peregrine falcon was another cage containing eight pigeons. ""This cage was in full sight of the cage containing the peregrine falcon, and again had no water and the cage was in a filthy condition with hardly any perches."" All the birds were sent for assessment by a wildlife veterinarian at the RSPCA West Hatch Wildlife Centre, where just five pigeons were deemed fit to be given the chance of rehabilitation. Gravenor was sentenced to 14 weeks custody, suspended for 12 months. In her defence, her solicitor said her breathing was impacted by respiratory condition psittacosis, known as pigeon fanciers lung, and had struggled since the death of her husband. After sentencing Mr Hogben said: ""Keeping and rehabilitating wild birds is a huge commitment requiring specialist knowledge, husbandry, equipment and accommodation. ""While most rescues and sanctuary owners start out with the best intentions, sadly, vulnerable animals entering these establishments can sometimes end up in even worse situations than they were in already, with sanctuary owners ending up in situations not realising the severity of the problems with their establishments until it is too late.""","['RSPCA', 'Animal welfare', 'Pigeons', 'Wales', 'Birds']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C844/production/_132286215_untitled-138.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4DA6/production/_132287891_untitled-139.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E9E6/production/_132287895_untitled-141.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13806/production/_132287897_untitled-140.jpg']","['By Paul Pigott', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67945032,Machynlleth: Four-mile trip to take 90 minutes,It is usually a four-mile journey between two nearby towns that takes about 10 minutes.,2024-01-12,"It is usually a four-mile journey between two nearby towns that takes about 10 minutes. However, getting from Pennal in Gwynedd to Machynlleth, Powys, is set to take an hour and a half because of a diversion of 46 miles (74km). This is in place during February for work on a new bridge across the River Dyfi aimed at reducing flooding. For Gwenan Roberts, from Pennal, the concern is not just getting to work - but to hospital when her baby arrives. She is seven months pregnant, and said: ""The worry is that the baby comes early. ""If he comes early then who knows what's going to happen? ""But also getting the kids to school on the other side of the river in Glantwymyn. I also work in Glantwymyn, so for me to get to work and for them, it's an extra hour and a half every morning, and every evening to come home. ""It won't be just a 10-minute drive any more."" Her fourth child is due in March, when the A493 is due to be reopened, but she is worried if things do not go to plan, she could face a longer journey to the maternity unit in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion. The Welsh government insisted work was vital to create a ""safer and more resilient"" route through the area, ensuring the road was no longer affected by flooding. ""The work will take place throughout February and will involve drainage improvement works that will also protect a row of Grade II listed properties on the A493,"" a spokesperson said. It said officials would work with contractor Alun Griffiths to keep disruption to a minimum. While the 46-mile route is the recommended diversion, locals have been told that there is a shorter 29-mile (46km) journey along a B road. But this is little consolation, and Aled Rees, from Pennal community council, said he was worried about what would happen in an emergency. ""It could be a heart attack, it could be a stroke, it could be a car accident or an accident on the farm, where you need an ambulance to get to Aberystwyth quickly, and it's just not going to happen,"" he said. ""We accept that this work has got to be done, nobody's arguing about that. It's just the way it's done. ""We'd like it to be modified, and we'd like it to get done as soon as possible, possibly working 24 hours a day."" The MS for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Mabon ap Gwynfor, has raised the concerns of residents in the Senedd. He said: ""We have people living there who go to the GP surgery in Machynlleth, we have students going to school in Machynlleth and people who need to go to the hospital in Aberystwyth, let alone businesses who travel along that road. ""So it will have a very negative impact and I'm really concerned about it."" The new Dyfi bridge, which will open to traffic in February, has cost £46m and taken more than two years to build. It will sit above fields which are part of the Dyfi flood plain. After periods of heavy rain they are often underwater, causing the closure of the old 19th Century Dyfi bridge. Even when the new bridge opens, disruption will not quite be at an end - sections of the nearby A493 and A487 will close for a month from 10 February for further work.","['Machynlleth', 'Welsh government', 'Wales', 'Pennal', 'Aberystwyth']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7600/production/_132280203_mediaitem132280202.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/27E0/production/_132280201_mediaitem132280200.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/84CD/production/_132279933_roadroutemap.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15C14/production/_132280198_mediaitem132280197.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['By Craig Duggan', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

The proposed site would generate enough power for 45,000 homes and save more than three million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to developers. But those opposed say the levels should be protected from development as a site of special scientific interest (SSI). More than 2,000 people have signed a petition calling for more protection. The petition launched by the Gwent Wildlife Trust has called for a ""halt to significant development on the levels until full, formal protection for the landscape has been agreed"". The charity has already halted a scheme to build the M4 relief road through the area, an area of wetland between east Cardiff and Chepstow, Monmouthshire. The developer of the proposed solar farm - between the M4 and Llanwern Steelworks near Newport and called Craig y Perthi - said the opportunities for wildlife were ""enormous"". But campaigners said they were concerned about the site, 20% of which would be in a site of an SSSI and surround the community from three sides. Adam Taylor, chief executive of the Gwent Wildlife Trust, said: ""The Gwent Levels are one of the most threatened SSSIs in Wales. ""SSIs only cover 8% of the area of the whole of Wales, and we think these sites should be sacrosanct and shouldn't be subject to development. Ninety-two percent of Wales is available for solar and other sustainable developments and we would recommend that these developments take place there instead"". Campaigners say planning laws need to be amended to protect the long-term future of the Gwent Levels. Mike Webb, from the Gwent Wildlife Trust, said: ""It's been here for thousands of years. It's the result of the interaction of humans with nature. ""We're not calling for a moratorium on every single, small for example domestic planning application. It's a moratorium on major developments on the levels."" Diana Callaghan, who has lived in the area for 25 years, said: ""It's a wonderful place to be, but as a resident I fear this area is really under threat. ""We can't keep covering our landscape with plastic and glass and buildings and cement, because the planet needs green space to survive as well"". Robin Johnson of JMB Solar, part of power generating company RWE, and project manager for the site, said he recognised how important it was to look after the wildlife benefits of the solar farm. He said: ""The opportunities for wildlife here are enormous. ""With a solar farm you are only penetrating about 1% of the ground because panels sit above ground, and underneath the panels you have a diverse grassland which encourages the local wildlife, especially reptiles and birds that can thrive on a solar site as opposed to an intensively managed agricultural site."" About 5,000 people have signed the petition so far, which needs 10,000 signatures by late January to be debated in the Senedd. The Welsh government said: ""We are working on strategic planning guidance to protect the Gwent Levels from unacceptable biodiversity and landscape impacts. ""We have also updated national planning policy to ensure there is enhanced protection for all sites of special scientific interest.""","['Bishton', 'Wales', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Solar power']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0CD2/production/_130828230_gettyimages-1371860702.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1835F/production/_132276199_adamtaylorchiefexecgwentwildlifetrust.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E71F/production/_132276195_dianacallaghan-resident.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1353F/production/_132276197_robinjohnsonprojectmanagerrwe.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Garry Owen', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales

Arriva Wales' X51 bus from Rhyl to Wrexham will no longer stop in the village of Llandegla, Denbighshire. The firm said the change, which begins on 14 January, was necessary because of ""reduced speeds across the network"". ""This is unsustainable for village life, we'll feel so disconnected and isolated,"" said resident Wendy Spiers . Passengers will now have to make their way to the next nearest stop on the A525, which is half a mile away from the village centre, with much of the route unlit and without pavements. Residents will hold a public meeting about the withdrawal at the village Memorial Hall on Friday about their next steps, and say there was no consultation about the change. Ms Spiers said the reason Arriva gave did not make sense, because turning off to pick up and drop off in Llandegla only took five minutes out of the entire journey. ""We think this is a knee-jerk reaction by Arriva,"" she added. Sandra Ellis Rogers, from Llandegla community council, said she only heard about the change when she was getting off the bus on her way home from work last week. ""The driver said, do you know you can't get off here next week? He couldn't tell me anything else. There are not even any notices about it in the bus shelters,"" she said. ""This will have a detrimental effect on the village. We'll be cut off, there are people going to work, students, people who are elderly or with disabilities who can't drive,"" added Ms Rogers. ""The bus passes right by the Wrexham Maelor hospital, people catch it if they have appointments. Many people use the GP in Ruthin. How will they get there now?"" Jasmine Rose, a volunteer at the village community cafe, said it would affect her personally as a bus user, but she was also concerned for ""vulnerable people"" in the village. ""We have [people] who have mobility issues, they can't get up to the other stop,"" she said. ""The bus stopping in the village centre helps them to get out to the wider community, both Ruthin and Wrexham... and feel connected."" A spokesperson for Arriva Wales said the new 20mph limit was having an impact on its operations. ""The consequence of this change in speed has been severe and has caused increased lost mileage and reduced punctuality,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have been open in raising our concerns with Transport for Wales, the Welsh government and local authorities."" Another service, the 51, is also being altered to save time, and will no longer call into Tweedmill near St Asaph. Clwyd West MS Darren Millar said he wants the Welsh government to engage with Arriva Wales on the issue and said he ""shared the concerns"" of local residents. North Wales MS Carolyn Thomas said she was concerned about the ""huge impact"" on the villagers of Llandegla. In a statement, the Welsh government said: ""We have been clear we will continually monitor any impacts of the new default 20mph speed limit on bus services.

Both escaped uninjured through a broken windscreen after the crash at Welshpool Airport, Powys, in September. A report by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) found the passenger was taking part in a helicopter experience day. The pilot said the passenger, who had no previous flying experience, failed to relinquish control when asked. The passenger was allowed to take control during his first flight on a two-seat light helicopter, the report noted. But the pilot quickly took over when the aircraft began to drift. After a debrief and a break to refuel, the passenger was allowed to take control on a second flight. He tried hovering the helicopter at a height of about 15ft (4.6m), but it hit the ground and rolled on to its side. The report said the pilot and passenger disagreed about the cause of the accident. ""The pilot considered that the accident had occurred due to the passenger not releasing the controls when commanded,"" the report said. ""The passenger's account of the accident sequence differed from that of the pilot."" He stated he had immediately released his grip of the cyclic control when commanded by the pilot, and the helicopter ""accelerated forward"" before it ""swerved to the right"" and then ""to the left and hit the ground"". ""The AAIB investigation was unable to resolve the differences between these two statements, but this accident highlights the importance of clear communication and setting out responsibilities as part of the pre-flight brief and, should it be deemed appropriate, the ability of the pilot to stop the flight at any time,"" it added.","['Wales', 'Welshpool', 'Air Accidents Investigation Branch', 'Aviation accidents and incidents']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1398C/production/_132286208_screenshot2024-01-12095833.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['By Paul Pigott & Andy Gourlay', 'BBC News']",UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67940107,Almost half of family courts to allow reporting in England and Wales,A pilot scheme to allow journalists and legal bloggers to report cases from three family courts in England and Wales is to be extended to almost half of the courts in the countries.,2024-01-12,"A pilot scheme to allow journalists and legal bloggers to report cases from three family courts in England and Wales is to be extended to almost half of the courts in the countries. From 29 January, coverage of cases at 16 more family court centres in England will be permitted. This means 19 of the 43 centres in England and Wales will be part of the Transparency Pilot. Families and individual social workers will be anonymous under the scheme. However, reporting can include the names of local authorities and some experts, once Transparency Orders are granted. For the first time in these courts, reporters will be able to speak to families about their cases, quote from documents and describe what they see and hear in court. Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the High Court's Family Division, described the move as a ""huge step to increase transparency and improve public confidence and understanding of the family justice system"". He urged the media to come to the family courts, to see the ""vital and challenging work"" that is done there. Journalists and legal bloggers will be able to apply for Transparency Orders in Liverpool, Manchester, West Yorkshire, Hull, the Midlands, Dorset, Truro, Luton, Guildford and Milton Keynes, as well as in all of London's family courts. Initially, reporting will be limited to ""public law cases"", where judges are deciding whether children should be taken into care. As happened in the pilot centres of Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle, reporting will be extended  later to ""private law cases"", where parents are separating. It will also be allowed eventually at magistrates' hearings of family cases. During the past year, the BBC has reported extensively from the pilot courts, including a series of in-depth pieces on individual stories on Radio 4's Today programme. Another piece, by BBC Look North, focused on an abuse survivor's legal fight to get her children back. Our report on a mother trying to remove parental rights from her child's paedophile father led to calls to change the law. Cathy Ashley, of the Family Rights Group, which supports many families in these cases, said she ""warmly welcomed"" the extension. She said it would help parents understand the system, and provide a ""mechanism"" to ensure it was ""accountable and transparent"". She said it should be backed by sufficient resources, and that children and their families should be central to any evaluation of the scheme. Lucy Reed KC, a family barrister who founded the Transparency Project 10 years ago, said this was a ""very significant development"". She called it a ""major opportunity"" for the media and legal bloggers to help the public understand how the family court works, ""what it does well, and where things need to change"". There has been criticism of the family courts, and calls for greater transparency, for decades. Family judges have the power to make some of the most drastic interventions in people's lives, as they can take children away from their parents and place them in care or up for adoption. Where parents are separating, these courts decide where children should live, and how much contact they should have with each parent. These cases often involve allegations of domestic abuse. The BBC will be continuing to cover family court stories in the new pilot centres. Please get in touch by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

The Department of Education, Sport and Culture (DESC) has confirmed it intends to seek Tynwald approval to shut the Southern Swimming Pool. It is due to a shortfall in the subsidies available to keep all of the region's pools open. Rushen MHK Michelle Haywood said she was ""furious"" and pledged to fight against the pool's closure. Along with fellow Rushen MHK Juan Watterson, she said she intended to meet with the pool board and representatives of all the southern local authorities next week. She said they were ""angry and upset"" and felt the South was ""getting a really rough ride"", adding that the pool was important to the local community. Ms Haywood said it was vital to teach island children to swim, and the loss would see it take too much of the school day to transport them to another pool. An annual government subvention of about £1.1m is paid to prop up the island's three sites, run by local authorities in the south, north, and west. A previous review found finances at the Castletown facility were ""critical"" after ""years of underinvestment"", and Tynwald tasked the department to investigate the idea of regional sport hubs. The report is due to be published on Monday, with Tynwald asked to back the closure in February. The DESC has said the decision had been taken due to the ""a number of factors, including its age, condition and loan-free status"". The move would save the department £434,000 a year and ""allow it to support the remaining pools within budget"", it said.

Those who did not respond via email by 1 February would also agree to a ban on industrial action over pay until 2027, the letter outlined.

In the letter received by teachers, Ms Millar thanked them for their ""continued hard work"" and expressed hope ""to find a way to move forwards"". She said the States Employment Board did not wish to ""undermine"" the collective bargaining process or disrespect either union or the ""autonomy of any teacher"" who was a member of both or neither.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954799,"UK and US strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen are self-defence, says Rishi Sunak","The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said.",2024-01-12,"The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said. The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was ""necessary, proportionate, and targeted"" to protect lives and commercial shipping. In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK ""acted in self-defence"" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. ""We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."" He said: ""It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong."" Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes ""immediately planned"". The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route."" Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were ""inevitable"" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. ""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. ""We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said. Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954152,Sunak vows that Ukraine will never be alone as he pledges £2.5bn package,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year.",2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year. It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles. Mr Sunak said he was confident allies ""will come together to continue to support Ukraine"". In the US, Republicans are blocking a $60bn (£47bn) package of support for Ukraine in an attempt to increase spending on tackling migration along America's southern border. And in the EU, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has blocked a €50bn (£43bn) support package for Ukraine in a funding row with Brussels.

The decision to commit the UK to military action is a landmark moment in any prime minister's tenure in office. The government has the prerogative to do this without wider political consultation. But in this instance, ministers concluded there was sufficient time to brief the cabinet, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle before any strikes began. Sir Lindsay and Mr Healey attended a briefing in person in Whitehall. Sir Keir joined the briefing remotely. 'I understand the briefing was conducted by the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. These conversations are a courtesy. But they are more than a courtesy. Ministers are aware of the scepticism, in parliament and beyond, about the wisdom, or lack of it attached to British military operations over recent decades. Take the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, until very recently a minister himself. Writing on social media, he said: ""Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front: What counts as success? Realistically, how far [would] we need to go to achieve this? How will we avoid being dragged into something we don't want?""

The decision to commit the UK to military action is a landmark moment in any prime minister's tenure in office. The government has the prerogative to do this without wider political consultation. But in this instance, ministers concluded there was sufficient time to brief the cabinet, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle before any strikes began. Sir Lindsay and Mr Healey attended a briefing in person in Whitehall. Sir Keir joined the briefing remotely. 'I understand the briefing was conducted by the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. These conversations are a courtesy. But they are more than a courtesy. Ministers are aware of the scepticism, in parliament and beyond, about the wisdom, or lack of it attached to British military operations over recent decades. Take the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, until very recently a minister himself. Writing on social media, he said: ""Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front: What counts as success?

A handwritten note from the then-Labour PM, published by the public inquiry on Friday, suggests he raised concerns after being warned the system was ""possibly unreliable"". But he said he gave it the go-ahead after being reassured by others. Among them was Peter Mandelson, who was then his trade and industry secretary. There was no indication at this stage that the Horizon software would lead to wrongful accusations of theft but there were concerns about its reliability and ballooning cost. In a letter dated 10 December 1998, Lord Mandelson said he believed the ""only sensible choice"" was to proceed with Horizon. He warned that cancelling the contract would cause ""political fallout"" from post office closures and damage relations with Fujitsu, which he described as a major investor in the UK. The letter, and the submission to Sir Tony, were both previously shown in hearings at the inquiry, which was launched in 2021, but have now been published in full. In 1998 Horizon was being developed by a firm called ICL, owned by Fujitsu, as a way of paying welfare benefits through Post Office counters using a swipe card. Ultimately this element of the project was dropped and the system was rolled out in 1999 for tasks like accounting and stocktaking instead. More than 900 workers were prosecuted after the faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. The Horizon project, which was launched under John Major's Conservative government, was running more than two years behind schedule by 1998. The project was referred up to Sir Tony to decide if it should continue. A submission sent to the then-prime minister on 9 December 1998 by a special adviser at Downing Street, Geoff Mulgan, described the system as ""increasingly flawed"". Mr Mulgan warned that ""in the long-run"" it would ""prove unsatisfactory"" and described it as ""hugely expensive, inflexible, inappropriate and possibly unreliable"". Mr Blair jotted a handwritten note on the document that asked for a ""clear view"" on its reliability. On 14 December 1998, his private secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote to Mr Mulgan to say that the prime minister's ""clear preference would be to avoid cancelling the project"". Witness statements given by other former Labour ministers, including Alistair Darling and Stephen Byers, previously set out how the government came up with a number of options to save the ailing scheme. In his own witness statement, given to the inquiry in 2022, Sir Tony pointed to a letter from Lord Mandelson written on 10 December 1998 as an example of the reassurance he had received. In the letter, Lord Mandelson said ""the basic development work has been thoroughly evaluated by independent experts who have pronounced it viable, robust and of a design which should accommodate future technological developments"". No former minister has said in their evidence to the inquiry that they knew of specific problems which led to sub-postmasters being wrongly accused of theft. Lord Mandelson's letter also warned that if the government cancelled the contract ""our relations with Fujitsu, a major inward investor into the UK over the past decade, would be severely damaged, as would the credibility"" of Private Finance Initiatives or PFIs - then a new method of funding major projects. In September 1998, Fujitsu announced it was closing a semiconductor plant in Sir Tony's Sedgefield constituency in County Durham, with the loss of 600 jobs. In his witness statement, Sir Tony said he was ""naturally concerned"" about the impact of the closure and it was mentioned by him in passing in a letter to the chairman of Fujitsu. However, he said he did not recall this being relevant to the matters being considered by the inquiry. Lord Mandelson's letter, which was sent to the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Byers and copied to the prime minister, also reflected concerns the system was vital for generating the footfall needed to keep post offices open. He wrote that ""the damage to the confidence of sub-postmasters and the knock-on effect of network closures"", which he said would come from cancelling Horizon, ""will produce political fallout, no matter how carefully we try to handle it"". Lord Mandelson's office has been approached for comment. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As the documents show, and make completely clear, Mr Blair took the issue very seriously.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944525,Fujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concerns,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"".",2024-01-12,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"". The Japanese-owned firm is at the heart of the long-running Post Office IT scandal. Court documents reveal the Foreign Office had originally wanted to rehire Vodafone for the contract to supply communications equipment. But it re-ran its procurement following a legal challenge from Fujitsu. Last autumn the most senior civil servant in the department told MPs scrutinising government spending that the programme to replace its communications system would also be 12 months late being delivered. A government spokesperson said, as with all contracts, it continued to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review. Fujitsu declined to comment. Fujitsu was one of three companies bidding for a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) contract in 2021 to replace a system of secure electronic communications connecting civil servants and diplomats across 532 sites in more than 170 countries. Officials had abandoned an earlier procurement process in 2018 following a challenge from Fujitsu. When Vodafone contested the FCDO's decision in the courts it emerged that Fujitsu's winning 2021 bid had been evaluated as having ""significant deficiencies resulting in a technical solution that is likely to be unfit for purpose, and requiring workarounds"". It was nevertheless the highest scoring bid. Vodafone was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to overturn the FCDO's decision. Last October the most senior civil servant in the department wrote to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending, to warn the replacement of the communications system was forecast to be 12 months late in being delivered. MPs from across the House of Commons have questioned why Fujitsu has continued to win government contracts despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that its Horizon system serving the Post Office contained ""bugs, errors and defects"". A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account - legally and financially. ""Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review."" They added that Fujitsu's system has undergone extensive testing to ensure it is ""fit for purpose"" before its deployment to the FCDO's global sites. Digital procurement expert Mike Bracken said governments often signed contracts with suppliers on the basis that any problems would be ironed out once work begins. ""In a world of rapid technology change and changing customer demand, [this] is not very wise,"" he told the BBC. ""It leads to government holding many legacy contracts which are not fit for purpose but are contractually and operationally difficult to move away from."" Mr Bracken, who founded the Government Digital Service before setting up consultancy Public Digital, said governments would be better off ""starting small"" with pilot projects and having shorter contracts. But he added: ""They often prefer to offer one big contract and hope that issues can be worked on as they arise, despite minimal evidence that this ever works."" New procurement rules aimed at strengthening the accountability of suppliers and the government's power to challenge and remove them come into force later this year.

It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles. Mr Sunak said he was confident allies ""will come together to continue to support Ukraine"". In the US, Republicans are blocking a $60bn (£47bn) package of support for Ukraine in an attempt to increase spending on tackling migration along America's southern border. And in the EU, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has blocked a €50bn (£43bn) support package for Ukraine in a funding row with Brussels.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944525,Fujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concerns,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"".",2024-01-12,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"". The Japanese-owned firm is at the heart of the long-running Post Office IT scandal. Court documents reveal the Foreign Office had originally wanted to rehire Vodafone for the contract to supply communications equipment. But it re-ran its procurement following a legal challenge from Fujitsu. Last autumn the most senior civil servant in the department told MPs scrutinising government spending that the programme to replace its communications system would also be 12 months late being delivered. A government spokesperson said, as with all contracts, it continued to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review. Fujitsu declined to comment. Fujitsu was one of three companies bidding for a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) contract in 2021 to replace a system of secure electronic communications connecting civil servants and diplomats across 532 sites in more than 170 countries. Officials had abandoned an earlier procurement process in 2018 following a challenge from Fujitsu. When Vodafone contested the FCDO's decision in the courts it emerged that Fujitsu's winning 2021 bid had been evaluated as having ""significant deficiencies resulting in a technical solution that is likely to be unfit for purpose, and requiring workarounds"". It was nevertheless the highest scoring bid. Vodafone was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to overturn the FCDO's decision. Last October the most senior civil servant in the department wrote to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending, to warn the replacement of the communications system was forecast to be 12 months late in being delivered. MPs from across the House of Commons have questioned why Fujitsu has continued to win government contracts despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that its Horizon system serving the Post Office contained ""bugs, errors and defects"". A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account - legally and financially. ""Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review."" They added that Fujitsu's system has undergone extensive testing to ensure it is ""fit for purpose"" before its deployment to the FCDO's global sites. Digital procurement expert Mike Bracken said governments often signed contracts with suppliers on the basis that any problems would be ironed out once work begins. ""In a world of rapid technology change and changing customer demand, [this] is not very wise,"" he told the BBC. ""It leads to government holding many legacy contracts which are not fit for purpose but are contractually and operationally difficult to move away from."" Mr Bracken, who founded the Government Digital Service before setting up consultancy Public Digital, said governments would be better off ""starting small"" with pilot projects and having shorter contracts. But he added: ""They often prefer to offer one big contract and hope that issues can be worked on as they arise, despite minimal evidence that this ever works."" New procurement rules aimed at strengthening the accountability of suppliers and the government's power to challenge and remove them come into force later this year.

The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was ""necessary, proportionate, and targeted"" to protect lives and commercial shipping. In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK ""acted in self-defence"" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. ""We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."" He said: ""It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong."" Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes ""immediately planned"". The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route."" Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were ""inevitable"" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. ""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. ""We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said. Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

Kevin Hollinrake said that people found to be responsible for the scandal ""must be held to account"" after the official inquiry reaches a verdict. He added that he didn't think there was a ""hope in hell"" of the Post Office bringing private prosecutions. Hundreds were wrongly prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 after being falsely accused of stealing money. There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal, with only 93 so far being overturned, after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from accounts. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. Speaking on the BBC's Any Questions show, Mr Hollinrake said: ""If it's individuals, those people can be criminally prosecuted, potentially, and potentially can go to jail. ""I think we'd all like to see that kind of route taken. People must be held to account."" Asked if he wants to see those responsible from the Post Office jailed, he replied: ""I absolutely do"", adding that it would be the ""ultimate deterrent"". The Post Office scandal has been thrust back into the limelight in recent weeks after the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was broadcast. An inquiry into the scandal re-started on Thursday, with ex-Post Office investigator Stephen Bradshaw denying he and colleagues behaved like ""mafia gangsters"" towards wrongly accused sub-postmasters. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons on Wednesday that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024.","['Post Office Inquiry', 'Post Office Ltd']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1F71/production/_132294080_mediaitem132290829.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67954031,"A landmark moment for Rishi Sunak, but uncertainty abounds","For Rishi Sunak, strikes against the Houthi rebels mark a landmark moment of his premiership.",2024-01-12,"For Rishi Sunak, strikes against the Houthi rebels mark a landmark moment of his premiership. The decision to commit the UK to military action is a landmark moment in any prime minister's tenure in office. The government has the prerogative to do this without wider political consultation. But in this instance, ministers concluded there was sufficient time to brief the cabinet, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle before any strikes began. Sir Lindsay and Mr Healey attended a briefing in person in Whitehall. Sir Keir joined the briefing remotely. 'I understand the briefing was conducted by the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. These conversations are a courtesy. But they are more than a courtesy. Ministers are aware of the scepticism, in parliament and beyond, about the wisdom, or lack of it attached to British military operations over recent decades. Take the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, until very recently a minister himself. Writing on social media, he said: ""Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front: What counts as success? Realistically, how far [would] we need to go to achieve this? How will we avoid being dragged into something we don't want?"" For his part, the prime minister said in a statement that the Houthi attacks ""cannot stand"". He continued: ""The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade. We have therefore taken limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"". And it is likely there will be a statement and a debate in the Commons, perhaps on Monday, with the government pressed to elaborate on just these kind of points: what it hopes to achieve, by when and at what cost. Not soon enough, some will argue. We have already heard from the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru. The Lib Dems and Plaid say it is wrong that parliament has been bypassed. The SNP leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: ""It is incumbent upon the UK Government to appraise Parliament as soon as possible and MPs must therefore be recalled to Westminster"". This moment has looked increasingly likely: a military response to match the rhetoric threatening just that. It was impossible not to join the dots when Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was asked on Wednesday about the prospect of military action against Houthis and said: ""Watch this space."" He could have ducked the question. He instead implied something was coming. So, what next, diplomatically, geopolitically, militarily and economically? There are risks associated with action. And risks associated with doing nothing. The risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East? A further shrivelling of shipping traffic through the Red Sea, a vital artery of the world economy? Let's see. And all this after the twin global shocks of the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic. More uncertainty beckons: unknown consequences abound.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67956770,Rishi Sunak faces call for MP vote on Houthi air strike,"Rishi Sunak is facing calls for a vote on RAF air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, amid concerns over escalation in the Middle East.",2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak is facing calls for a vote on RAF air strikes against Houthi rebel targets in Yemen, amid concerns over escalation in the Middle East. Downing Street briefed Sir Keir Starmer and Commons' Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle shortly before air strikes began on Thursday evening. Parliament had already risen for the weekend. The Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru have urged it to be recalled to hold a vote on the military action. Downing Street has said there are ""no plans for a retrospective vote"" as parliamentary approval is not required for military action. Commons votes have been held on most armed interventions since the 2003 Iraq war, but constitutionally only the prime minister can authorise strikes. Overnight on Thursday, a US-led air strike hit more than 70 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Houthis say five of their members were killed and six others injured. The action was the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year. The airstrike will not go without ""punishment or retaliation"", the group's leadership have warned. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was ""fully supportive"" of the military action aimed at preventing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. ""I want the prime minister to make a statement as soon as possible, but the principle of taking action against the Houthi rebels is really important,"" he added. But Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that the UK and US action could set ""the region alight"". Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, described the strikes as ""a reckless act of escalation"" and said it ""is utterly disgraceful that Parliament has not even been consulted"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he had ""made representations"" to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden who gave the briefing on Thursday evening, for the Commons ""to be informed at the earliest possible opportunity"" about the military action. He said he was ""happy to facilitate a recall at any time"". Scotland's First Minister, and SNP leader, Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action, lending his support for the Westminster parliament to be recalled. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is ""minded to approve"" military action in the Yemen but he says it's a matter of principle that the government should seek the approval of parliament. The party is demanding a recall, saying MPs should not be ""by-passed"". ""When it comes to military action and putting military people on the frontline, it is important that MPs take that incredibly seriously and have that debate,"" the party's foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said. MPs must hear the government's reasoning for the strikes and contingency plans for retaliatory measures because ""this could well not be the end of it"", she added. The prime minister has said he will make a Commons statement on Monday - after he returns from a visit to Ukraine, but a vote is thought to be unlikely. Asked why he had not recalled Parliament ahead of the military action, Mr Sunak argued the action taken was ""limited and necessary"". He accused the Houthis of acting ""with impunity"", and said their behaviour needed to be responded to with a ""strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong"". In an effort to reassure MPs, Mr Sunak has published a summary of the legal advice which underpinned the military action. Government lawyers said the strikes were legally taken to ""downgrade the Houthi's capabilities and deter further attacks"". While there is no suggestion that further action is imminent, the BBC understands if another intervention does become necessary, new legal advice will have to be sought. Ministers have told the BBC that the timing of the strikes could not be determined by the UK government alone, as this was a US-led operation. It is likely we will hear calls for a parliamentary vote in advance of any further action - should any be deemed necessary - when MPs meet on Monday. The House of Commons Library suggests that, on the basis of recent military operations, prior approval is now required when military action is taken. But the Institute for Government think tank points out the guidance is ""far from clear cut"". So, what are the rules?

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944687,Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill.,2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has warned she will vote against it unless he accepts ""improvements"" to strengthen the legislation. More than 50 MPs on the right of the party, including Liz Truss, are now backing moves to toughen up the bill. The prime minister is trying to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda after the Supreme Court ruled the earlier scheme was unlawful. Meanwhile, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, has backed three amendments which would tone down some parts of the bill. Mrs Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak in November, told GB News the current version of the bill ""does not work"" and would amount to ""a betrayal to the British public"". The legislation will return to the Commons next Tuesday and Wednesday, when MPs will debate and vote on a series of amendments. It will then face a final Commons vote which it must clear to be sent to the Lords for further scrutiny. Asked how she would vote at this stage if there were no changes, Mrs Braverman replied: ""If there are no improvements to it, I will have to vote against it, I'm afraid. I am sent to Parliament to vote for things, to be for things or to be against them, not to sit on the fence. ""I owe it to the British people to be transparent and honest about the situation that we are in. It is absolutely essential that we deliver on this pledge to stop the boats."" Writing on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, former prime minister Ms Truss said: ""We need to crack down on illegal migration and remove the loopholes being exploited by activist lawyers. ""It's essential the legislation we are passing is watertight. That's why I am backing amendments to the Bill."" Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned last month over the legislation and is co-ordinating a series of rebel amendments, has warned the bill as it stands is ""guaranteed to fail"". Illegal migrants would continue to successfully challenge their removal in court, in a fresh ""merry-go-round"" of appeals, he said. The government insists the legislation, the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, will allow only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. But the amendments backed by Sir Robert would delete clauses from the bill declaring Rwanda ""a safe country"", disapplying the Human Rights Act, and forcing courts to disregard interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The One Nation group is the largest single faction within the Conservative parliamentary party. It says more than 100 MPs are members, almost a third of the total. It argues that the UK's human rights obligations in international law must be respected. Former first secretary of state Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he had been assured the bill would not be strengthened. ""The prime minister's looked me in the eye and said that he doesn't want to go any further,"" he told the New Statesman. The Rwandan government has said it will pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said the government would carry on talking to MPs and ""carefully consider"" amendments put forward. It had worked to ensure the bill was ""robust"", No 10 added. Before Christmas, Mr Sunak comfortably saw off a Tory rebellion over the bill, when it cleared its first Commons hurdle by a majority of 44 votes. But the scale of party divisions on the issue has again been highlighted in recent days - with a number of former cabinet ministers, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, backing the amendments from MPs on the right of the party. Nearly two years after Boris Johnson's government first announced plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, none has been sent to the east African country. The bill aims to stop flights being grounded by legal action by declaring that, in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country. It would enable ministers to ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight there while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it would still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore ECHR injunctions, blocking flights. The prime minister has promised to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and argues his Rwanda scheme will prove a significant deterrent. Labour says the scheme is a hugely expensive ""gimmick"" which will not work, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused Mr Sunak of being ""taken hostage by his own party"". It says it would tackle illegal migration by prioritising the smashing of people-smuggling gangs. The government has a working Commons majority over other parties and independent MPs of 56, implying that 29 Conservative MPs would need to vote against the bill to defeat it. But in practice that majority is larger because some independent MPs usually vote with the government and others tend to be absent. In addition to this, some Tory rebels are likely to abstain, while others may also vote with the government. If the bill does clear its Commons stages, it is likely to face prolonged opposition in the Lords. Meanwhile, the Home Office has published a report on ""safe and legal routes"" for migrants seeking to enter the UK, but it does not list any new routes. Campaigners have long argued that the government needs to provide safe routes for people seeking refuge from war and oppression, to help tackle illegal migration. During debates on the Illegal Migration Act, which became law in July 2023 and bars anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum, ministers promised to ""specify additional safe and legal routes"". No 10 said there were already a significant number of routes and its priority was to secure the UK's borders. ""While the compassion of the UK is clearly unlimited, our capacity is not,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. In a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the report reaffirmed the government's ""commitment to providing safe and legal routes for those most in need"". ""As we get control on numbers, we will keep under review whether we are able to do more to support vulnerable refugees and whether we need to consider new safe and legal routes,"" he added. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon described the report as ""woefully inadequate with no meaningful commitment to expand safe routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Syria, and those fleeing repressive regimes in countries such as Iran"". ""By simply focusing on describing the existing limited schemes, the government has completely overlooked the urgent need to reduce dangerous Channel crossings by providing safe passage to our shores,"" he said.","['Conservative Party', 'Rwanda', 'Migration', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Liz Truss', 'Suella Braverman', 'Refugees and asylum seekers', 'UK immigration', 'Robert Buckland']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13E01/production/_132290418_e37113d501a071f307251cbc00b0b4db9a8d54ba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C14F/production/_132278494_49df87243c4fd2e37537c4637e12e27615f254c3.jpg']","['By Chas Geiger', 'Political reporter']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944525,Fujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concerns,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"".",2024-01-12,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"". The Japanese-owned firm is at the heart of the long-running Post Office IT scandal. Court documents reveal the Foreign Office had originally wanted to rehire Vodafone for the contract to supply communications equipment. But it re-ran its procurement following a legal challenge from Fujitsu. Last autumn the most senior civil servant in the department told MPs scrutinising government spending that the programme to replace its communications system would also be 12 months late being delivered. A government spokesperson said, as with all contracts, it continued to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review. Fujitsu declined to comment. Fujitsu was one of three companies bidding for a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) contract in 2021 to replace a system of secure electronic communications connecting civil servants and diplomats across 532 sites in more than 170 countries. Officials had abandoned an earlier procurement process in 2018 following a challenge from Fujitsu. When Vodafone contested the FCDO's decision in the courts it emerged that Fujitsu's winning 2021 bid had been evaluated as having ""significant deficiencies resulting in a technical solution that is likely to be unfit for purpose, and requiring workarounds"". It was nevertheless the highest scoring bid. Vodafone was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to overturn the FCDO's decision. Last October the most senior civil servant in the department wrote to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending, to warn the replacement of the communications system was forecast to be 12 months late in being delivered. MPs from across the House of Commons have questioned why Fujitsu has continued to win government contracts despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that its Horizon system serving the Post Office contained ""bugs, errors and defects"". A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account - legally and financially. ""Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review."" They added that Fujitsu's system has undergone extensive testing to ensure it is ""fit for purpose"" before its deployment to the FCDO's global sites. Digital procurement expert Mike Bracken said governments often signed contracts with suppliers on the basis that any problems would be ironed out once work begins. ""In a world of rapid technology change and changing customer demand, [this] is not very wise,"" he told the BBC. ""It leads to government holding many legacy contracts which are not fit for purpose but are contractually and operationally difficult to move away from."" Mr Bracken, who founded the Government Digital Service before setting up consultancy Public Digital, said governments would be better off ""starting small"" with pilot projects and having shorter contracts. But he added: ""They often prefer to offer one big contract and hope that issues can be worked on as they arise, despite minimal evidence that this ever works."" New procurement rules aimed at strengthening the accountability of suppliers and the government's power to challenge and remove them come into force later this year.

The talks are aimed at ensuring a smooth transition in the event that an opposition party wins power. The meetings would enable Labour to establish relationships with civil servants and exchange information. Simon Case, who heads the civil service, will oversee and arrange the discussions. Confirming the move, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""In line with the long-standing process set out in the cabinet manual, the prime minister has authorised access talks between the official opposition and civil service."" The next election must be held by 28 January 2025 but it is up to the prime minister to pick the actual date. Last week Mr Sunak told reporters: ""My working assumption is we'll have a general election in the second half of this year."" Access talks are usually held in the build up to an election and in order to get the process started, the opposition leader must write to the prime minister requesting the meetings. By convention, the prime minister is expected to authorise the talks, but has discretion over when they can start. The Cabinet manual, which sets out the procedures for government, says the meetings take place ""on a confidential basis, without ministers being present or receiving a report of discussions"". ""These discussions are designed to allow the opposition's shadow ministers to ask questions about departmental organisation and to inform civil servants of any organisational changes likely to take place in the event of a change of government. ""Senior civil servants may ask questions about the implications of opposition parties' policy statements, although they would not normally comment on or give advice about policies."" In 2019, talks between the civil service and Jeremy Corbyn, then Labour leader, were authorised in October, two months before the election was held.

The figure for 2020-22 was revealed in a Foreign Office report. Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell said all events organised by Government Hospitality during this period were ""in strict accordance with Covid-19 restrictions"". He highlighted figures from the report showing use of the cellar fell by 96% in 2020 to 2021. Some 130 bottles were drunk during this period, compared with 3,336 in 2019 to 2020. The figures increased between 2021 and 2022 to 1,303, but were still well below pre-pandemic levels. The alcohol, stored in the basement of Lancaster House in central London, is given to guests of the government. The wine cellar is expected to finance itself through sales of some of its high value stock and payments from other government departments. However, sales were not possible during the pandemic, only resuming in 2022. A hospitality fund was originally set up in 1908 to provide for ""high-level visiting overseas government guests and domestic guests"". In 1922 a committee was established to purchase alcohol and the Government Hospitality wine cellar was created. After the outbreak of World War Two, the cellar was topped up with wines requisitioned from the German Embassy and for part of the conflict, some of the cellar was relocated to Warwickshire ""for safe keeping"". A 2010 review concluded that the cellar was delivering value for money but recommended it should be a ""self-financing regime for the medium term, with targeted sales of high value stock helping to pay for future purchases"". These days the Government Wine Committee, which meets around three times a year, advises Government Hospitality on purchasing new stock. The committee is chaired by former diplomat Sir David Wright and the committee members are unpaid. The overall market value of the cellar's contents is estimated to be £3.66m, compared to £3.34m two years before. Between 2020 and 2021, £14,621 was spent on 516 bottles of Bordeaux, costing around £28 each. The following year, £12,356 went towards purchasing 636 bottles of English and Welsh sparkling wines,18 bottles of gin, and four bottles each of whisky and liqueurs. The pandemic prevented any sales of stock between 2020 and 2021 but they restarted in 2022. Responding to the report, Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said: ""For months we have asked why the government was suppressing the publication of this report, and now we know the answer. ""While the rest of the country was facing Covid restrictions and a cost-of-living crisis, the government was getting through 1,433 bottles from its wine cellar, and replenishing the stocks with a net spend of more than £100,000 over the three years from 2019-22.

Cardiff's Kindle, Brass Beetle, along with the Conway pub, all announced they were shutting as a result of rising costs. Now calls are being made for the Welsh government to rethink plans to cut rates relief from 75% to 40%. The Welsh government said it was giving £134m in rates support next year on top of permanent schemes worth £250m. In the draft budget in December, as well as announcing plans to slash rate relief from 75% to 40%, it said business rates would rise 5%. In England rate relief will remain 75%. UK Hospitality said a typical Welsh pub or restaurant could now pay an average £6,800 more than similar businesses in England. Cardiff pub and restaurant owner Cerys Furlong said businesses were facing pressures on all fronts. Her own food and energy costs had more than doubled, she said, adding that the UK's 20% VAT rate was one of Europe's highest. Cutting rate relief, she believes, would damage the hospitality sector - responsible for 8.5% of UK jobs and branded the plan ""short sighted"". ""It would be interesting to see what analysis they've done on the impact it would have on jobs and business failures,"" she said. Simon Wright has 35 years experience in hospitality and said the situation was the worst he had faced. ""I do think Welsh government will want to look again at their draft budget,"" he said. ""The idea you're going to raise more money from businesses is reliant on those businesses actually existing."" Food business PR consultant Jane Cook said businesses were struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel and were ""looking ahead and feeling quite worried for their futures"". Ms Furlong said helping hospitality helped the economy. ""That's what the Welsh government says it wants to do,"" she said. ""Well let's see it incentivise that and allow it to continue."" The Welsh government said thousands of small businesses were exempt from paying any rates. It said it was providing a fifth successive year of support for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with their rates bills, costing £78m. A spokesman said: ""This builds on the almost £1bn of support provided in rates relief schemes to these sectors since 2020-21. ""A new £20m capital fund will also be developed for 2024-25 to provide support to help retail, leisure and hospitality businesses future-proof their businesses.""","['Cardiff', 'Hospitality industry', 'Wales business', 'Welsh government', 'Wales', 'Cost of living']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5ABD/production/_132292232_brassbeetle.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14135/production/_132292228_cerysfurlong.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0C9D/production/_132292230_janecook.jpg']","['By Owain Evans', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67957739,Is the economy facing another energy price shock?,Both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden cited the global economic impact of Houthi attacks on Red Sea cargo ships in overnight statements as the reasoning behind military action.,2024-01-12,"Both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden cited the global economic impact of Houthi attacks on Red Sea cargo ships in overnight statements as the reasoning behind military action. The Treasury has modelled scenarios suggesting that disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the UK economy, risking a recession. The main fear in the Treasury's analyses is of a rise of at least $10 per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas. Rises such as these have not actually materialised, so far, mainly because of the actions of Saudi Arabia - the major oil producing nation - in soothing global energy markets with price cuts. The US and UK will hope that their overnight strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels will help reverse widespread delays and disruption to Red Sea trading routes, by re-establishing safe passage through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait into the Suez Canal. But, on the other hand, there is now also a clear pathway of escalation to a wider Middle East conflict. Oil prices had fallen quite significantly before this, helping petrol prices drop below £1.40 a litre to a two-year low. And on Friday, while prices rose by 4%, they are still a relatively manageable $80 per barrel. But disruption to cargo traffic risks spreading from the Red Sea across the Arabian Peninsula to the Strait of Hormuz, another key trading route. On Thursday, Iran's navy seized a US-linked oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman as part of a long-running row between the two nations. If that situation also escalates, another energy shock is possible with the risk of $100 per barrel of oil on the horizon - just as the impact of the Ukraine crisis was fading. Meanwhile, Europe is now much more physically dependent on flows of shipped gas from Qatar, after supplies from Russian pipelines were stopped. European energy majors have been queuing up to do deals with Doha after Russian taps were turned off. Even if physical supplies could be made up from the US - now the world largest exporter of liquified natural gas - the price would surge on any disruption in the Gulf. A serious escalation could further disrupt the global economy, entrenching inflation, just as the world's central banks were pondering turning points and cutting interest rates. It would also mark clear parallels with the 1970s, when two separate geopolitical energy shocks from the Arab-Israeli War and the Iranian Revolution led to prolonged inflation over several years. So action taken to protect the world economy, is even on that basis alone, not without its risks.","['Suez canal', 'Yemen crisis', 'Yemen', 'Oil']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AA59/production/_132290634_tankernew.png'],,UK,Politics

It comes ahead of a legal deadline to restore the executive by next Thursday before fresh elections are required. Signatures from 30 assembly members are required for the petition to succeed. There have been six recalls since May 2022. Every time there has been a vote to elect a Speaker, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has blocked the move. The party's veto, which is unlikely to change before next week's recall, means no other assembly business can take place. The latest legal deadline for the assembly to be restored coincides with a mass strike involving thousands of public sector workers calling for better pay and conditions. The Sinn Féin recall petition is expected to be backed by the Alliance Party and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). In a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said it was ""decision time for the DUP"". ""Our public sector workers play a pivotal role right across our society working in our hospitals, schools, on trains and buses, and within the civil service."" A sitting of the assembly could take place by Wednesday, but parties have to select a new Speaker before they can take any other decisions. The DUP has been blocking the restoration of Stormont's power-sharing institutions since 2022 in protest against post-Brexit trade checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It believes the arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol diminish the region's place within the UK internal market. A new deal, called the Windsor Framework, aimed at addressing those concerns was agreed in February 2023 between the government and European Union. But the DUP said this did not go far enough, and for months the party has been in talks with the government seeking further changes. In December, Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris said those talks had ""effectively concluded"" and offered a £3.3bn financial package for Northern Ireland if the Stormont institutions are restored. That financial package includes almost £600m to solve the pay disputes at the heart of the public sector strikes. The recall petition is seeking to debate a motion supporting those pay demands and calling for the DUP to resume power sharing. If no executive is formed by Thursday, the Northern Ireland secretary is under a legal duty to call an early assembly election. However, Mr Heaton-Harris has pushed this deadline back several times before and has indicated he may do so again. In the last assembly election in May 2022, Sinn Féin became the largest party at Stormont for the first time, pushing the DUP into second place. But Stormont's structures governing power-sharing between unionists and nationalists mean an executive cannot be restored without the support of both parties.","['SDLP (Social Democratic and Labour Party)', 'Alliance Party (Northern Ireland)', 'Northern Ireland Assembly', 'DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Sinn Féin']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/166F/production/_127334750_bf141d25860ddfc601870a8768715828f0d828f9.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6B25/production/_132292472_1e6b5100583cda39e9a59daad825248107eb4977.jpg']","['By Brendan Hughes', 'BBC News NI political reporter']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67956866,FM calls for UK parliament recall over Yemen air strikes,Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has called for the UK parliament to be recalled over the air strikes in Yemen.,2024-01-12,"Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has called for the UK parliament to be recalled over the air strikes in Yemen. The UK and US strikes against Houthi rebel sites have been described by Rishi Sunak as ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect the global shipping in the Red Sea. The targeted strikes on military facilities took place overnight. Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let there be no equivocation that the SNP align ourselves with the UN security resolution, which is essentially calling for the Houthi rebels to stop their attacks in the Red Sea. ""But of course the UK's record on military intervention, particularly in the Middle East, is not a good one. ""Before action was taken, the correct and appropriate thing to have done would have been to have recalled parliament, who have given serious detail about any proposed military action."" He added: ""There are significant questions around the action taken. What is the end goal? What will be deemed as a success?"" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the strikes against the Iranian-backed group, who he accuses of threatening UK ships, was in ""self-defence"". In response, Houthi officials have warned that the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year. The Houthis control much of Yemen and say they are supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Mr Sunak accused the Houthi rebels of threatening UK and international ships and causing major disruption to the trade route. ""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week, "" the prime minister said. ""This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade."" The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, has confirmed her sister-in-law and her four children had escaped Gaza. Her brother is a doctor at Al-Nassar Hospital. He is still in the territory with other relatives. Ms El-Nakla's parents returned to Scotland in November after being trapped in Gaza for four weeks when the war with Israel broke out during a family visit. In a statement she said: ""I'm pleased that my sister-in-law, Doaa, and their four children have escaped from Gaza, and are now safe. ""However, my brother Mohamed remains there along with my 93-year-old grandmother and many wider family members."" Ms El Nakla, who is a Dundee councillor, said families in Gaza were ""still suffering after the loss of entirely innocent men, women and children"". She urged the UK government to launch a resettlement scheme for Palestinians, similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa. She added: ""I will continue to raise my voice to stop the killing and suffering of the innocent people of Gaza, and call for an immediate and urgent ceasefire."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""Over 300 British nationals and their dependants have so far left Gaza, and we are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave. ""We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing as required to provide consular assistance. ""Any dependants of British citizens who need a visa can apply for one. More than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. During the initial Hamas attacks on Israel some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.","['British Armed Forces', 'Yemen', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Humza Yousaf', 'Military', 'Houthis', 'Ministry of Defence']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3820/production/_132286341_jet-woo-ooh-ooh.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6566/production/_132285952_b950aeb08ddbaaf7e38ba3dea7d4c58e9c533529.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/EA9A/production/_132285006_yemen_gaza640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4176/production/_132285761_nadiafamily.png']",,UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjlg32ngwrzo,A shift in tone as the SNP gears up for election,"When Rishi Sunak announced it was his “working assumption” that there would be a general election in the second half of this year, he effectively fired the campaign starting gun.",2024-01-12,"When Rishi Sunak announced it was his “working assumption” that there would be a general election in the second half of this year, he effectively fired the campaign starting gun.And Humza Yousaf has wasted no time in spelling out the message he wants to hammer home in the months ahead.He treated activists and sitting MPs and MSPs to a speech in Glasgow on Friday.But – given that he can already rely on their votes – they weren’t the intended audience. The SNP leader was pitching to those in Scotland who back the idea of independence, but are flirting with voting Labour to get Rishi Sunak out of Number 10.He essentially told them that they can have their cake and eat it at the next general election.His logic goes like this: Sir Keir Starmer has it in the bag. He will be Prime Minister. Labour’s UK-wide lead is so commanding that Scottish seats won’t swing the election.Therefore, he argues, independence supporters should back the SNP to keep independence on the agenda.Humza Yousaf wants to reassure them that they can have everything they want – an end to Conservative government, whilst keeping the prospect of independence alive and well.The independence part of that message is nothing new. Though there does appear to be a slight change in tone.There was a stark column from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard in recent days. Writing in the Sunday National, he warned “if the SNP lose the election in Scotland, the debate on independence stops”.It appears Humza Yousaf may have been reading at the weekend, because he seems to have adopted elements of this message.Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he said that a big Labour vote in Scotland would take the cause of independence “backwards”. I put it to Humza Yousaf that it sounds like he’s sending a warning to independence supporters. He insisted he isn’t.But he is keen to stress that he believes a lack of SNP MPs won’t just hurt his party, but the wider independence movement.Back at party conference last October, the first minister was keen to talk up the opportunities of SNP success for those who back independence.But it feels like the new year has marked a shift to talking about the pitfalls of an underwhelming performance.He told me any independence supporter “must vote for what you believe in”. In his mind, that’s a vote for the SNP.It’s important to note that other pro-independence parties, such as the Greens and Alba, are available. There’s logic behind his approach. Polls suggest the cause of independence is more popular than the SNP. Humza Yousaf believes tying the two together can improve his party’s chances.Though there are still those who question the specifics on how a large number of SNP MPs shifts the dial on independence in the years ahead. One party figure I spoke to was happy to see the party settle on a more straightforward campaign message. But they were also concerned that some voters unhappy with the SNP/Green government’s performance in Scotland might look to give the party a bloody nose at election time, even if they back independence.This is a theory shared by figures in Scottish Labour.They think that many Scots are underwhelmed by the day-to-day running of the country, and will look to punish the SNP the next time they go to the polls (even if it’s a vote for Westminster, not Holyrood).Scottish Labour also argue that electing their candidates gives Scottish MPs the chance to sit at the heart of the UK government. The Scottish Conservatives will be content with the ground on which Humza Yousaf hopes to fight the forthcoming election.If he wants to talk about independence, they’re more than happy to play ball and put forward the opposing side of the argument. Elections soak up a lot of a party leader’s time and energy. And Humza Yousaf already has plenty on his plate.He’s responsible for day-to-day government in Scotland. And SNP infighting is more public than at any time in recent political memory.But at least one of his jobs seems to be done – he’s settled on a campaign message. As ever, the key question is ‘will it work?’It’s easy to see the rationality behind the approach Humza Yousaf is taking. But you’re a brave person if you’re willing to predict the outcome of an election that may yet be the best part of a year away.","['Scottish government', 'SNP (Scottish National Party)', 'Labour Party', 'Scottish independence', 'Humza Yousaf']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/077a/live/44759a10-b172-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/dd15/live/a9460330-b172-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg']","['David Wallace Lockhart', 'BBC Scotland political correspondent', '@BBCDavidWL']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954152,Sunak vows that Ukraine will never be alone as he pledges £2.5bn package,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year.",2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year. It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles. Mr Sunak said he was confident allies ""will come together to continue to support Ukraine"". In the US, Republicans are blocking a $60bn (£47bn) package of support for Ukraine in an attempt to increase spending on tackling migration along America's southern border. And in the EU, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has blocked a €50bn (£43bn) support package for Ukraine in a funding row with Brussels.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67941495,"Tony Blair was warned Horizon IT system could be flawed, documents show","Sir Tony Blair was warned the Horizon IT system at the centre of the Post Office scandal could be flawed before it was rolled out, a document shows.",2024-01-12,"Sir Tony Blair was warned the Horizon IT system at the centre of the Post Office scandal could be flawed before it was rolled out, a document shows. A handwritten note from the then-Labour PM, published by the public inquiry on Friday, suggests he raised concerns after being warned the system was ""possibly unreliable"". But he said he gave it the go-ahead after being reassured by others. Among them was Peter Mandelson, who was then his trade and industry secretary. There was no indication at this stage that the Horizon software would lead to wrongful accusations of theft but there were concerns about its reliability and ballooning cost. In a letter dated 10 December 1998, Lord Mandelson said he believed the ""only sensible choice"" was to proceed with Horizon. He warned that cancelling the contract would cause ""political fallout"" from post office closures and damage relations with Fujitsu, which he described as a major investor in the UK. The letter, and the submission to Sir Tony, were both previously shown in hearings at the inquiry, which was launched in 2021, but have now been published in full. In 1998 Horizon was being developed by a firm called ICL, owned by Fujitsu, as a way of paying welfare benefits through Post Office counters using a swipe card. Ultimately this element of the project was dropped and the system was rolled out in 1999 for tasks like accounting and stocktaking instead. More than 900 workers were prosecuted after the faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. The Horizon project, which was launched under John Major's Conservative government, was running more than two years behind schedule by 1998. The project was referred up to Sir Tony to decide if it should continue. A submission sent to the then-prime minister on 9 December 1998 by a special adviser at Downing Street, Geoff Mulgan, described the system as ""increasingly flawed"". Mr Mulgan warned that ""in the long-run"" it would ""prove unsatisfactory"" and described it as ""hugely expensive, inflexible, inappropriate and possibly unreliable"". Mr Blair jotted a handwritten note on the document that asked for a ""clear view"" on its reliability. On 14 December 1998, his private secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote to Mr Mulgan to say that the prime minister's ""clear preference would be to avoid cancelling the project"". Witness statements given by other former Labour ministers, including Alistair Darling and Stephen Byers, previously set out how the government came up with a number of options to save the ailing scheme. In his own witness statement, given to the inquiry in 2022, Sir Tony pointed to a letter from Lord Mandelson written on 10 December 1998 as an example of the reassurance he had received. In the letter, Lord Mandelson said ""the basic development work has been thoroughly evaluated by independent experts who have pronounced it viable, robust and of a design which should accommodate future technological developments"". No former minister has said in their evidence to the inquiry that they knew of specific problems which led to sub-postmasters being wrongly accused of theft. Lord Mandelson's letter also warned that if the government cancelled the contract ""our relations with Fujitsu, a major inward investor into the UK over the past decade, would be severely damaged, as would the credibility"" of Private Finance Initiatives or PFIs - then a new method of funding major projects. In September 1998, Fujitsu announced it was closing a semiconductor plant in Sir Tony's Sedgefield constituency in County Durham, with the loss of 600 jobs. In his witness statement, Sir Tony said he was ""naturally concerned"" about the impact of the closure and it was mentioned by him in passing in a letter to the chairman of Fujitsu. However, he said he did not recall this being relevant to the matters being considered by the inquiry. Lord Mandelson's letter, which was sent to the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Byers and copied to the prime minister, also reflected concerns the system was vital for generating the footfall needed to keep post offices open. He wrote that ""the damage to the confidence of sub-postmasters and the knock-on effect of network closures"", which he said would come from cancelling Horizon, ""will produce political fallout, no matter how carefully we try to handle it"". Lord Mandelson's office has been approached for comment. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As the documents show, and make completely clear, Mr Blair took the issue very seriously. His response to the Mulgan note, and in other interactions, was to raise the issue of the viability and reliability of the end project as this was his overarching concern. He subsequently received these reassurances. ""It is now clear that the Horizon product was seriously flawed, leading to tragic and completely unacceptable consequences, and he has deep sympathy with all those affected.""","['Post offices', 'Post Office Inquiry', 'Tony Blair', 'Post Office Ltd']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6D85/production/_132273082_gettyimages-542861805.jpg'],"['By Helen Catt', 'Political correspondent']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944687,Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill.,2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has warned she will vote against it unless he accepts ""improvements"" to strengthen the legislation. More than 50 MPs on the right of the party, including Liz Truss, are now backing moves to toughen up the bill. The prime minister is trying to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda after the Supreme Court ruled the earlier scheme was unlawful. Meanwhile, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, has backed three amendments which would tone down some parts of the bill. Mrs Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak in November, told GB News the current version of the bill ""does not work"" and would amount to ""a betrayal to the British public"". The legislation will return to the Commons next Tuesday and Wednesday, when MPs will debate and vote on a series of amendments. It will then face a final Commons vote which it must clear to be sent to the Lords for further scrutiny. Asked how she would vote at this stage if there were no changes, Mrs Braverman replied: ""If there are no improvements to it, I will have to vote against it, I'm afraid. I am sent to Parliament to vote for things, to be for things or to be against them, not to sit on the fence. ""I owe it to the British people to be transparent and honest about the situation that we are in. It is absolutely essential that we deliver on this pledge to stop the boats."" Writing on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, former prime minister Ms Truss said: ""We need to crack down on illegal migration and remove the loopholes being exploited by activist lawyers. ""It's essential the legislation we are passing is watertight. That's why I am backing amendments to the Bill."" Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned last month over the legislation and is co-ordinating a series of rebel amendments, has warned the bill as it stands is ""guaranteed to fail"". Illegal migrants would continue to successfully challenge their removal in court, in a fresh ""merry-go-round"" of appeals, he said. The government insists the legislation, the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, will allow only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. But the amendments backed by Sir Robert would delete clauses from the bill declaring Rwanda ""a safe country"", disapplying the Human Rights Act, and forcing courts to disregard interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The One Nation group is the largest single faction within the Conservative parliamentary party. It says more than 100 MPs are members, almost a third of the total. It argues that the UK's human rights obligations in international law must be respected. Former first secretary of state Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he had been assured the bill would not be strengthened. ""The prime minister's looked me in the eye and said that he doesn't want to go any further,"" he told the New Statesman. The Rwandan government has said it will pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said the government would carry on talking to MPs and ""carefully consider"" amendments put forward. It had worked to ensure the bill was ""robust"", No 10 added. Before Christmas, Mr Sunak comfortably saw off a Tory rebellion over the bill, when it cleared its first Commons hurdle by a majority of 44 votes. But the scale of party divisions on the issue has again been highlighted in recent days - with a number of former cabinet ministers, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, backing the amendments from MPs on the right of the party. Nearly two years after Boris Johnson's government first announced plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, none has been sent to the east African country. The bill aims to stop flights being grounded by legal action by declaring that, in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country. It would enable ministers to ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight there while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it would still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore ECHR injunctions, blocking flights. The prime minister has promised to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and argues his Rwanda scheme will prove a significant deterrent. Labour says the scheme is a hugely expensive ""gimmick"" which will not work, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused Mr Sunak of being ""taken hostage by his own party"". It says it would tackle illegal migration by prioritising the smashing of people-smuggling gangs. The government has a working Commons majority over other parties and independent MPs of 56, implying that 29 Conservative MPs would need to vote against the bill to defeat it. But in practice that majority is larger because some independent MPs usually vote with the government and others tend to be absent. In addition to this, some Tory rebels are likely to abstain, while others may also vote with the government. If the bill does clear its Commons stages, it is likely to face prolonged opposition in the Lords. Meanwhile, the Home Office has published a report on ""safe and legal routes"" for migrants seeking to enter the UK, but it does not list any new routes. Campaigners have long argued that the government needs to provide safe routes for people seeking refuge from war and oppression, to help tackle illegal migration. During debates on the Illegal Migration Act, which became law in July 2023 and bars anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum, ministers promised to ""specify additional safe and legal routes"". No 10 said there were already a significant number of routes and its priority was to secure the UK's borders. ""While the compassion of the UK is clearly unlimited, our capacity is not,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. In a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the report reaffirmed the government's ""commitment to providing safe and legal routes for those most in need"". ""As we get control on numbers, we will keep under review whether we are able to do more to support vulnerable refugees and whether we need to consider new safe and legal routes,"" he added. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon described the report as ""woefully inadequate with no meaningful commitment to expand safe routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Syria, and those fleeing repressive regimes in countries such as Iran"". ""By simply focusing on describing the existing limited schemes, the government has completely overlooked the urgent need to reduce dangerous Channel crossings by providing safe passage to our shores,"" he said.","['Conservative Party', 'Rwanda', 'Migration', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Liz Truss', 'Suella Braverman', 'Refugees and asylum seekers', 'UK immigration', 'Robert Buckland']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13E01/production/_132290418_e37113d501a071f307251cbc00b0b4db9a8d54ba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C14F/production/_132278494_49df87243c4fd2e37537c4637e12e27615f254c3.jpg']","['By Chas Geiger', 'Political reporter']",UK,Politics

Downing Street briefed Sir Keir Starmer and Commons' Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle shortly before air strikes began on Thursday evening. Parliament had already risen for the weekend. The Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru have urged it to be recalled to hold a vote on the military action. Downing Street has said there are ""no plans for a retrospective vote"" as parliamentary approval is not required for military action. Commons votes have been held on most armed interventions since the 2003 Iraq war, but constitutionally only the prime minister can authorise strikes. Overnight on Thursday, a US-led air strike hit more than 70 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Houthis say five of their members were killed and six others injured. The action was the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year. The airstrike will not go without ""punishment or retaliation"", the group's leadership have warned. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was ""fully supportive"" of the military action aimed at preventing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. ""I want the prime minister to make a statement as soon as possible, but the principle of taking action against the Houthi rebels is really important,"" he added. But Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that the UK and US action could set ""the region alight"". Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, described the strikes as ""a reckless act of escalation"" and said it ""is utterly disgraceful that Parliament has not even been consulted"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he had ""made representations"" to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden who gave the briefing on Thursday evening, for the Commons ""to be informed at the earliest possible opportunity"" about the military action. He said he was ""happy to facilitate a recall at any time"". Scotland's First Minister, and SNP leader, Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action, lending his support for the Westminster parliament to be recalled. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is ""minded to approve"" military action in the Yemen but he says it's a matter of principle that the government should seek the approval of parliament. The party is demanding a recall, saying MPs should not be ""by-passed"". ""When it comes to military action and putting military people on the frontline, it is important that MPs take that incredibly seriously and have that debate,"" the party's foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said. MPs must hear the government's reasoning for the strikes and contingency plans for retaliatory measures because ""this could well not be the end of it"", she added. The prime minister has said he will make a Commons statement on Monday - after he returns from a visit to Ukraine, but a vote is thought to be unlikely. Asked why he had not recalled Parliament ahead of the military action, Mr Sunak argued the action taken was ""limited and necessary"". He accused the Houthis of acting ""with impunity"", and said their behaviour needed to be responded to with a ""strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong"". In an effort to reassure MPs, Mr Sunak has published a summary of the legal advice which underpinned the military action. Government lawyers said the strikes were legally taken to ""downgrade the Houthi's capabilities and deter further attacks"". While there is no suggestion that further action is imminent, the BBC understands if another intervention does become necessary, new legal advice will have to be sought. Ministers have told the BBC that the timing of the strikes could not be determined by the UK government alone, as this was a US-led operation. It is likely we will hear calls for a parliamentary vote in advance of any further action - should any be deemed necessary - when MPs meet on Monday. The House of Commons Library suggests that, on the basis of recent military operations, prior approval is now required when military action is taken. But the Institute for Government think tank points out the guidance is ""far from clear cut"". So, what are the rules?

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954799,"UK and US strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen are self-defence, says Rishi Sunak","The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said.",2024-01-12,"The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said. The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was ""necessary, proportionate, and targeted"" to protect lives and commercial shipping. In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK ""acted in self-defence"" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. ""We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."" He said: ""It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong."" Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes ""immediately planned"". The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route."" Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were ""inevitable"" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. ""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. ""We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said. Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67950473,Wales junior doctor strike: Many operations cancelled,A health board has postponed 80% of planned operations as junior doctors in Wales prepare for three strike days.,2024-01-12,"A health board has postponed 80% of planned operations as junior doctors in Wales prepare for three strike days. British Medical Association (BMA) members called it a last resort to stop more leaving due to pay erosion. Dr Emily Sams said they were offered less than England and Scotland, meaning they ""don't need to go halfway around the world to Australia for better pay"". Health Minister Eluned Morgan reassured people that urgent and life-threatening care will continue to be provided. ""We are disappointed junior doctors have voted for industrial action, but we understand the strength of feeling among BMA members,"" said Ms Morgan. ""We would like to address their pay restoration ambitions, but the pay award offer we have made is at the limits of the finances available to us and reflects the position reached with the other unions. ""We continue to press the UK government to pass on the funding necessary to provide full and fair pay rises for public sector workers."" Ms Morgan encouraged people who need to attend an emergency department to still do so throughout the strike action, and for others to consider ""the best option for them"", including using the 111 online or phone service, or go to their local pharmacy. She said non-emergency and elective appointments and treatments are expected to be stood down, with services resembling bank holiday staffing. All seven health boards said patients should still attend appointments unless they have been contacted directly not to. Cardiff and Vale Health Board said it plans to continue all urgent and emergency services throughout the strike. Aneurin Bevan and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boards said their emergency departments and critical care services will continue to be available for the most serious and urgent patients. Hywel Dda University and Swansea Bay health boards said they expects planned care services to be impacted and will ""prioritise patients with urgent care needs wherever possible"". There are about 4,000 junior doctors working in Wales, making up 40% of its total medical workforce, mainly in hospitals. Nearly a quarter work for Cardiff and Vale health board, which provides a large proportion of highly specialised treatment like neurosurgery and transplants. It means the impact on planned services will be significant. It is understood 75% of outpatient appointments and 80% of operations will not take place, to free up more senior staff to cover shifts around the clock. The BMA in Wales has planned a three-day strike from 07:00 GMT Monday January 15 until 07:00 the following Thursday in a dispute over pay. Its members have already been given a 5% rise by the Welsh government, which is below the 6% recommended by the independent remuneration body. In England, junior doctors have already been given 8.8%, but have rejected an additional offer worth 3% on average. In Scotland, an improved offer of 12.4% has been accepted, while in Northern Ireland a ballot is planned. Dr Sams is a general surgical trainee and a BMA Wales representative who graduated seven years ago and now works in south east Wales. She said of the colleagues she graduated alongside, 10 have since moved to Australia, many with the intention of staying a year or two, but have delayed plans to return while the pay disparity remains. Dr Sams said the pay increase for junior doctors in Wales represents the lowest rate of anywhere in the UK. ""We're at a point now in Wales where doctors don't need to go halfway around the world to Australia for better pay and better working conditions,"" she said. ""Doctors will look across the border to England and Scotland."" She said for a long time Wales had struggled to attract trainees with contracts on offer across the border. ""And the pay now is much worse than it is in England and Scotland,"" she added. ""It means we're not attracting the best doctors to Wales. It means there will be more rota gaps. Our patients deserve more, we deserve to have the best doctors working here."" Health bosses will not know exactly how many staff will take part in the industrial action until the day, but significant disruption is expected. Donna Coleman, regional director for health and social care body Llais in west Wales, said: ""People already know they're going to have sometimes very long waits for some kinds of surgery, so when they see this further disruption on top it's even more devastating for them. ""They just absolutely are at a loss with what to do and plan for their lives ahead."" Industrial action by junior doctors in England featured prominently during 2023, with six days of action at the start of this year, but this is the first time their colleagues in Wales will have taken to the picket lines. Junior doctor is the broad title given to anyone who has graduated from medical school but is yet to qualify as a consultant, and can include doctors with nine years or more experience.","['Wales', 'Doctors', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/484D/production/_132190581_26454c0914625932e62b048d1042a44c3b0a501b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/15DF/production/_107899550_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/15DF/production/_107899550_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8988/production/_132280253_mediaitem132280252.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10526/production/_123745866_gettyimages-1237658203.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['By Jenny Rees', 'BBC Wales health correspondent']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67950962,"NI Stormont talks: Traditional direct rule off the table, says Tory MP","Traditional direct rule is unlikely if devolution is not restored in Northern Ireland, a Conservative MP has warned.",2024-01-12,"Traditional direct rule is unlikely if devolution is not restored in Northern Ireland, a Conservative MP has warned. Sir Robert Buckland said any alternative to the DUP agreeing a deal would likely mean the ""involvement of the Irish government"". The chair of Westminster's NI Affairs Committee called on the party to show courage. The DUP is boycotting Stormont over its protest against post-Brexit trade rules. In negotiations before Christmas, the government offered a £3.3bn financial package should the power-sharing executive return to Stormont. However, the DUP said more work is needed to be done in order for it to agree to return to devolved government in Northern Ireland. Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris has invited Northern Ireland's five largest parties for one-to-one talks at Hillsborough Castle on Monday. Devolution must be restored by Thursday night or Mr Heaton-Harris is legally obliged to call a fresh assembly election. However, the government has so far downplayed the prospect of calling an election and it can instead opt to legislate for a further delay. Sir Robert, speaking to BBC News NI's The View programme, was asked about comments by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, in which he told the Irish News there can be no return to ""direct rule or some form of Tory administration in the north"" and called for an ""enhanced role for the Irish government"". The Conservative MP said direct rule would mean ""triggering certain aspects of the Good Friday Agreement"" and ""involvement of the Irish government, ultimately"". When asked if ""old-style direct rule of the past"" was off the table, he responded: ""I think so. ""I think anybody who like many of us will have remembered and read and committed parts of the process of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement to memory, will know there is no going back to that previous dispensation. ""That would be to upend 26 years of progress. And that is what is at stake here."" Sir Robert described the government's £3.3bn offer as generous and denied that it was using ongoing strikes in Northern Ireland as a means to pressure the DUP into a deal. Public sector workers, including healthcare workers, education staff and civil servants, have been holding a number of strikes over pay. The government's offer includes £584m to solve public sector pay issues. ""I think on one level it's maybe a cynical view about how the UK government would view the valued contribution that public service workers make in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The reality is this facing all of us -  all of us as elected politicians have responsibilities to face up to. ""Sometimes we have to make decisions that we don't particularly like, we don't live in a perfect world. The DUP are part of this imperfect world. There isn't a perfect solution for them. ""But there is a solution and a solution that can deliver for their constituents, many of whom are public sector workers, in a way that I think would redound to their credit."" He added: ""That's why I think now is the time for leadership, for courage if you like - an overused word sometimes, but one that might apply in this case - to allow the executive to be formed as quickly as possible."" DUP MP Sammy Wilson in a post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, said Sir Robert had ""shown himself to be an arrogant little pipsqueak"" and called for him to apologise for his comments. Earlier, DUP deputy leader Gavin Robinson said Sir Robert was ""wrong"" and should ""focus on the restoration of Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market rather than making hollow threats about joint authority"". ""Sir Robert Buckland seems to be confused,"" Mr Robinson said. ""It's not often he is wrong but on this he is. The Republic of Ireland has no legal basis for governing Northern Ireland. Such a step would be a further breach of the Belfast and successor agreements."" Mr Robinson said it was the ""arrangements flowing from the NI Protocol alone"" that are stopping the formation of an executive. Monday's talks will discuss ongoing efforts to restore the executive. Before Christmas, when the secretary of state made the £3.3bn financial offer, he said it was ""time for [the DUP] to take some decisions"". The package includes £584m to address public sector pay issues, which has been at the heart of a series of strikes. Tens of thousands of workers including nurses, teachers and civil servants are taking part in a mass industrial action, billed by unions as the biggest strike in Northern Ireland's history., on Thursday, 18 January. But, before Christmas, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal did not offer a ""basis to deliver the financial stability Northern Ireland needs"". The party collapsed the devolved institutions almost two years ago in protest against post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey said there was no agreement with the government over the Windsor Framework, which the party says damages the economy and undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK.","['Sir Jeffrey Donaldson', 'DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Robert Buckland', 'Northern Ireland Assembly']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5814/production/_132284522_fbc4bd0dc42359a094027efd53f055148c623544.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11F2E/production/_132281537_gettyimages-1126962340.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10FA2/production/_132283596_bfe8437cccb42637441e312bef9d3cd981579cdc.jpg']",,UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-67958855,Kingswood by-election: Voters will choose new MP after Chris Skidmore's resignation,"Following the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, voters in Kingswood will elect a new representative in February.",2024-01-12,"Following the resignation of ex-Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, voters in Kingswood will elect a new representative in February. The former minister stood down from his position earlier this month over the government's energy plans. Mr Skidmore said he could not continue as a Tory MP ahead of a vote on a bill to guarantee annual oil and gas licensing rounds - triggering a by-election to be held in February. So why is this happening and what does it mean? Born and raised in the constituency, Mr Skidmore was first elected as Kingswood MP in 2010. He studied history at Oxford University, writing several books on the subject, and was among a number of backbench MPs, including Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, who wrote chapters in Britannia Unchained in 2012, a book promoting a low tax, free market ideology. Mr Skidmore served in governments under Theresa May and Boris Johnson, and signed the UK's net zero pledge into law as Interim Minister for Energy. He resigned over government policy to allow further licenses to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea and has continued to advocate for net zero since quitting. Mr Skidmore said he had found himself increasingly at odds with government policy on the environment over the past 18 months and has said he has ""no regrets"" about leaving Parliament. Kingswood is in South Gloucestershire. People living there might tell you they are from Bristol, as it lies on the edge of the city conurbation, but South Gloucestershire is its own unitary authority area and Kingswood is home to one of the offices for South Gloucestershire Council, though its headquarters are in Yate. The constituency also includes the districts of Hanham, Warmley, Longwell Green and Emersons Green. Following a boundary review, the constituency is due to be abolished at the next general election. Mr Skidmore's seat had a Conservative majority of 11,220 in the 2019 general election and had previously been held by Labour from 1992 to 2010. Like many parts of the UK, voters here have suffered with a cost of living crisis, and the sluggish economic performance of the country post-Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic. Kingswood High Street is part of a £25m regeneration scheme, but that has not stopped many businesses from closing. With many people living here also commuting into Bristol, public transport, or a lack of it, is also a big issue. ""We've had bank closures, other shops close, and we need the impetus of an MP that cares about the community,"" one voter told the BBC this week. The constituency has only ever been served by Conservative or Labour MPs, with the latter already throwing their campaign might at the seat. This week, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves paid a visit, following a speech in the constituency at the start of the year from party leader Sir Keir Starmer. Only Labour have announced a candidate so far - former mayor of Lewisham Damien Egan. Mr Egan grew up in the Kingswood constituency and pipped Bristol mayor Marvin Rees for the Labour candidacy for the newly created seat of Bristol North East - which will include areas of Kingswood. While the Conservatives are yet to announce their candidate, neighbouring Thornbury and Yate Tory MP Luke Hall criticised Labour's choice. He said: ""Do they really want the sitting mayor of Lewisham to be their member of parliament for Kingswood? ""Or do they want a local champion, who's lived in South Gloucestershire all their life?"" Mr Egan officially resigned as mayor of Lewisham earlier this week. One party which won't be standing is Reform UK, in protest over the cost. Their party leader Richard Tice described the by-election as ""a scandal of selfishness, of hypocrisy, and of grotesque abuse of taxpayers' cash"". The Kingswood by-election is being held on 15 February. It is one of two by-elections taking place on the same day as voters in Wellingborough will also go to the polls to replace Conservative Peter Bone, who lost the seat following a sexual misconduct scandal.

The Japanese-owned firm is at the heart of the long-running Post Office IT scandal. Court documents reveal the Foreign Office had originally wanted to rehire Vodafone for the contract to supply communications equipment. But it re-ran its procurement following a legal challenge from Fujitsu. Last autumn the most senior civil servant in the department told MPs scrutinising government spending that the programme to replace its communications system would also be 12 months late being delivered. A government spokesperson said, as with all contracts, it continued to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review. Fujitsu declined to comment. Fujitsu was one of three companies bidding for a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) contract in 2021 to replace a system of secure electronic communications connecting civil servants and diplomats across 532 sites in more than 170 countries. Officials had abandoned an earlier procurement process in 2018 following a challenge from Fujitsu. When Vodafone contested the FCDO's decision in the courts it emerged that Fujitsu's winning 2021 bid had been evaluated as having ""significant deficiencies resulting in a technical solution that is likely to be unfit for purpose, and requiring workarounds"". It was nevertheless the highest scoring bid. Vodafone was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to overturn the FCDO's decision. Last October the most senior civil servant in the department wrote to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending, to warn the replacement of the communications system was forecast to be 12 months late in being delivered. MPs from across the House of Commons have questioned why Fujitsu has continued to win government contracts despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that its Horizon system serving the Post Office contained ""bugs, errors and defects"". A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account - legally and financially. ""Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review."" They added that Fujitsu's system has undergone extensive testing to ensure it is ""fit for purpose"" before its deployment to the FCDO's global sites. Digital procurement expert Mike Bracken said governments often signed contracts with suppliers on the basis that any problems would be ironed out once work begins. ""In a world of rapid technology change and changing customer demand, [this] is not very wise,"" he told the BBC. ""It leads to government holding many legacy contracts which are not fit for purpose but are contractually and operationally difficult to move away from."" Mr Bracken, who founded the Government Digital Service before setting up consultancy Public Digital, said governments would be better off ""starting small"" with pilot projects and having shorter contracts. But he added: ""They often prefer to offer one big contract and hope that issues can be worked on as they arise, despite minimal evidence that this ever works."" New procurement rules aimed at strengthening the accountability of suppliers and the government's power to challenge and remove them come into force later this year.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67956427,NI politics: Strike action won't push DUP into Stormont deal,As Northern Ireland edges closer to a day of mass disruption the government and the DUP are locked in a political arm wrestle.,2024-01-12,"As Northern Ireland edges closer to a day of mass disruption the government and the DUP are locked in a political arm wrestle. London is desperate to push the party back into government but the DUP leader is not in a position to pull his party with him. Both sides are now in a standoff. The standoff hardened this week when it became clear the DUP will not be returning to Stormont ahead of Thursdays ""artificial"" deadline. That is the day when Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris will fall under a legal obligation to call a fresh assembly election if no Executive is formed by midnight. He is likely now to amend the legislation to push the deadline back by at least a year. Thursday is also the day when many public services in Northern Ireland will grind to a halt when workers from 15 unions take to the picket line. Meanwhile, the day before, Sinn Féin will seek a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly - the seventh such recall petition to have taken place since May 2022. On each occasion, the DUP has vetoed the election of a Speaker. The government had hoped that unprecedented level of public pressure would force the DUP to end its Stormont boycott. But it is going to be a ""good strike wasted"", as some have described it, as nothing is likely to change by the time workers put away their placards on Thursday night. If anything, the pressure will remain on the secretary of state, who has already accepted the need for pay parity and holds the cheque to make it happen. The unions taking part on Thursday's day of action are directing their fire at Chris Heaton-Harris and not the DUP. As one union leader declared this week - much to the frustration of the NIO - the local political parties are ""irrelevant"". Plan A is clearly not working and next week Chris Heaton-Harris may start working on Plan B. That process will begin on Monday when he meets the parties separately at Hillsborough castle. Expect the secretary of state to harden his language as London has now clearly run out of patience with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Mr Heaton-Harris will once again dangle the £3.3bn cash prize if the DUP return to Stormont. But he may also talk tough around further cuts to MLA salaries and may even threaten to go public with some of the deal offered to the DUP. All of which is unlikely to move the party any closer to Stormont and runs the risk of energising those within the DUP who are strongly opposed to a return to power sharing while any trace of an Irish Sea border remains in place. On Wednesday Chris Heaton-Harris will lead Northern Ireland Questions in the commons and that could be the moment when he spells out the government's next move. He may also commit to setting the budget for next year and striking the regional rate in the absence of an executive. Both of which present opportunities for him to raise the ante even further by talking up the prospect of more financial hardship for public services in Northern Ireland - at a time when there is a £3.3bn cheque waiting to be cashed. But how much longer can the secretary of state hold off releasing the £580m to bring public sector pay into line with the rest of the UK? The Treasury, we are told, is adamant the money will only be handed over as part of the £3.3bn package once Stormont returns. The government is also reluctant to loose the leverage over the DUP which comes with the money. Handing it over without a trade off would remove any hope of the public sector pay pressure being directed at the DUP. Politically it makes sense but morally it is hard to defend. The DUP insists the talks with the government are still ""live"" and has said the onus is on London to break the deadlock. Publishing the legislation which the government believes will secure Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market might be a first step in that direction. There is a lot for Chris Heaton-Harris to consider over the weekend while the rest of the cabinet focus on the fallout from the air strikes in Yemen. It will be a real test of his power-lifting skills if he plans to strong arm the DUP back into government. Muscle alone won't be enough.","['DUP (Democratic Unionist Party)', 'Northern Ireland Assembly']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/43CE/production/_132285371_fe694b8982d2f88e4a993a2c9052c749cb070f0b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/158F4/production/_119180388_sirjeffrey.jpg']","['By Enda McClafferty', 'BBC News NI political editor']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67945032,Machynlleth: Four-mile trip to take 90 minutes,It is usually a four-mile journey between two nearby towns that takes about 10 minutes.,2024-01-12,"It is usually a four-mile journey between two nearby towns that takes about 10 minutes. However, getting from Pennal in Gwynedd to Machynlleth, Powys, is set to take an hour and a half because of a diversion of 46 miles (74km). This is in place during February for work on a new bridge across the River Dyfi aimed at reducing flooding. For Gwenan Roberts, from Pennal, the concern is not just getting to work - but to hospital when her baby arrives. She is seven months pregnant, and said: ""The worry is that the baby comes early. ""If he comes early then who knows what's going to happen? ""But also getting the kids to school on the other side of the river in Glantwymyn. I also work in Glantwymyn, so for me to get to work and for them, it's an extra hour and a half every morning, and every evening to come home. ""It won't be just a 10-minute drive any more."" Her fourth child is due in March, when the A493 is due to be reopened, but she is worried if things do not go to plan, she could face a longer journey to the maternity unit in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion. The Welsh government insisted work was vital to create a ""safer and more resilient"" route through the area, ensuring the road was no longer affected by flooding. ""The work will take place throughout February and will involve drainage improvement works that will also protect a row of Grade II listed properties on the A493,"" a spokesperson said. It said officials would work with contractor Alun Griffiths to keep disruption to a minimum. While the 46-mile route is the recommended diversion, locals have been told that there is a shorter 29-mile (46km) journey along a B road. But this is little consolation, and Aled Rees, from Pennal community council, said he was worried about what would happen in an emergency. ""It could be a heart attack, it could be a stroke, it could be a car accident or an accident on the farm, where you need an ambulance to get to Aberystwyth quickly, and it's just not going to happen,"" he said. ""We accept that this work has got to be done, nobody's arguing about that. It's just the way it's done. ""We'd like it to be modified, and we'd like it to get done as soon as possible, possibly working 24 hours a day."" The MS for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Mabon ap Gwynfor, has raised the concerns of residents in the Senedd. He said: ""We have people living there who go to the GP surgery in Machynlleth, we have students going to school in Machynlleth and people who need to go to the hospital in Aberystwyth, let alone businesses who travel along that road. ""So it will have a very negative impact and I'm really concerned about it."" The new Dyfi bridge, which will open to traffic in February, has cost £46m and taken more than two years to build. It will sit above fields which are part of the Dyfi flood plain. After periods of heavy rain they are often underwater, causing the closure of the old 19th Century Dyfi bridge. Even when the new bridge opens, disruption will not quite be at an end - sections of the nearby A493 and A487 will close for a month from 10 February for further work.","['Machynlleth', 'Welsh government', 'Wales', 'Pennal', 'Aberystwyth']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7600/production/_132280203_mediaitem132280202.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/27E0/production/_132280201_mediaitem132280200.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/84CD/production/_132279933_roadroutemap.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15C14/production/_132280198_mediaitem132280197.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['By Craig Duggan', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics

The Lords' Day, which was published in 2007, is a tale about a security breach at the State Opening of Parliament. Its author, Michael Dobbs, told the BBC he was ""utterly surprised, overjoyed, very excited and rather deeply humbled"" that his thriller had been selected. He added that the move showed the Queen had ""a fantastic sense of humour"". In the book, the late Queen Elizabeth and the then-Prince Charles are among those held captive during a siege of the House of Lords. It was ""controversial"" when it first came out, Dobbs said, because it talked about possible security flaws in Parliament. But he said people eventually understood that he was not ""writing a manual for terrorists"". ""I was writing a novel which gave solutions on security, and it helped toughen up that security,"" he added. Dobbs, himself a member of the House of Lords, has also written other books including the original House of Cards. He sent a copy of The Lords' Day to the new King and Queen about a year ago ""for a chuckle"". ""I didn't expect them to read it, they are busy people,"" he added. He learned about the inclusion of his book on The Queen's Reading Room book list, as first reported by The Telegraph, about three weeks ago from his publisher. ""I was bowled over when I found out,"" he said. ""If you look at her previous choices, you have the likes of Dickens, Tolstoy, and some of the greatest modern authors on the list, and to have a Dobbs novel included was totally unexpected. ""The Queen is very serious about getting people to read, and opening up people's minds, which is what books do best,"" he added. The King carried out the State Opening of Parliament for the first time as monarch last November, accompanied by the Queen. The ceremony, dating back to the 15th Century, marks the start of a parliamentary session, bringing together the constituent parts of Parliament - the Crown, peers and MPs. The Queen's Reading Room launched as an online book club on Instagram, before becoming a charity last February. It includes a list of reading recommendations from the Queen herself. Other books on the list include Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo, and The Year of Eating Dangerously, by the Queen's son Tom Parker Bowles. The organisation also hosts an annual literary festival and has launched a new podcast. The BBC has contacted The Queen's Reading Room for a comment.","['House of Lords', 'Literature', 'UK Royal Family', 'King Charles III', 'UK Parliament', 'Books', 'Queen Camilla']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B642/production/_132285664_gettyimages-1874530905.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15282/production/_132285668_gettyimages-1831065418.jpg']","['By Noor Nanji', 'Culture correspondent']",UK,Politics

The petition was prompted by Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons for six weeks for breaching the code of conduct for MPs. North Northamptonshire Council (NNC) said voters in the constituency will start to receive their poll cards on 19 January. The poll cards will include information on how to arrange a postal or proxy vote for those who cannot make it to their polling station on the day. Anyone who is eligible to vote but is not registered has until 30 January to register following the process on the NNC website. Following a law change last year, people who vote in person on 15 February will have to remember to bring a form of photo ID with them. The deadline for nominations of candidates is 16:00 GMT on 23 January. So far, the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, and Reform UK have confirmed their candidates. Britain First has indicated it will also contest the by-election. Mr Bone could stand again, but it would be as an independent, as the Conservatives have suspended him. Candidates are listed in alphabetical order by surname. The Liberal Democrat candidate was born in Northamptonshire and grew up in the county. She joined Northamptonshire Police in 1985 and rose to the rank of inspector, serving across the county - including in Wellingborough - and she supervised the tactical firearms team. Ms Savage Gunn helped run security for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and later became a law enforcement consultant in the US, before her return to the UK and Northamptonshire. When Covid-19 broke out she retrained as a health care assistant and worked in her mother's care home, before becoming a Covid clinic co-ordinator in the county. She continues to work at the care home, and is a trustee of Northamptonshire Carers, in Wellingborough. Note: Gunn is used as the candidate's primary surname, hence she appears at the top of the alphabetical list. The candidate for Reform UK is the party's co-deputy leader and a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Brexit Party. Reform UK, previously the Brexit Party, was co-founded by Nigel Farage in 2018. Mr Habib is a property developer and fund manager, and previously a donor to the Conservatives. The 58-year-old said: ""I intend to give the Wellingborough by-election the best swing of my bat and if I am elected I will stand in the Commons and hold this wretched government to account to the very best of my ability."" Ms Harrison represents the Oundle ward on North Northamptonshire Council and is executive member for adults, health and wellbeing on the unitary authority. She also previously ran for Parliament in 2017 in the Derbyshire constituency of Bolsover - losing to Labour veteran Dennis Skinner, who in turn lost the ""red wall"" seat to the Conservatives in 2019. Ms Harrison said: ""I am delighted to have been selected as the candidate for Wellingborough. ""As the local candidate, I am best suited to deliver for the people of Wellingborough, having already done so on a local authority level."" She is also the partner of Mr Bone, who was first elected to the seat in 2005. Labour's candidate grew up in Northamptonshire and went to John Hellins Primary School in Towcester, and Kingsbrook secondary school - now Elizabeth Woodville School - in Roade. She has worked in the charity sector her whole career. In 2019, she stood as prospective parliamentary candidate for Labour in the South Northamptonshire constituency - losing to the Conservatives' Andrea Leadsom. After her selection in November, the Ms Kitchen said: ""Residents here are already telling me that they're fed up with the state of the town centre, anti-social behaviour blighting our high streets and the 8am scramble for a GP appointment. ""Labour has a plan to tackle these issues that impact so many here, but I will start by giving Wellingborough a voice in Westminster and working hard to restore pride in our town and villages."" Mr Morris, lives in Bozeat in the south of the constituency, having previously lived in Wellingborough, and works as an insurance underwriter. The 55-year-old has been a member of the Green Party for five years and has stood as the party's candidate for North Northamptonshire Council in Irchester and Rushden South. He has also served on Bozeat Parish Council for three years. Mr Morris said: ""What Wellingborough needs is a representative who knows and cares about local issues, rather than someone concerned with furthering their personal agenda in the national political arena. ""Local matters will always come first for me."" He has two children, aged 21 and 17, and is a season ticket holder at Northampton Saints. Mr Watts was born in Park Hospital (now Isebrook Hospital) in Wellingborough. He served in Northamptonshire Police and and has been councillor for Irchester Parish Council for over 10 years and is currently its vice-chairman. The Unite trade union member said he ""believes unions give working people a voice collectively"". Mr Watts said he wanted speak on behalf of the people in the constituency. ""That is what we haven't had in this constituency for years and years and years. We've not had the people's voice being heard,"" he said. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954799,"UK and US strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen are self-defence, says Rishi Sunak","The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said.",2024-01-12,"The UK has acted in self-defence attacking Houthi sites in Yemen, Rishi Sunak has said. The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was ""necessary, proportionate, and targeted"" to protect lives and commercial shipping. In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK ""acted in self-defence"" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. ""We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."" He said: ""It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong."" Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes ""immediately planned"". The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route."" Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were ""inevitable"" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. ""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. ""We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said. Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67941495,"Tony Blair was warned Horizon IT system could be flawed, documents show","Sir Tony Blair was warned the Horizon IT system at the centre of the Post Office scandal could be flawed before it was rolled out, a document shows.",2024-01-12,"Sir Tony Blair was warned the Horizon IT system at the centre of the Post Office scandal could be flawed before it was rolled out, a document shows. A handwritten note from the then-Labour PM, published by the public inquiry on Friday, suggests he raised concerns after being warned the system was ""possibly unreliable"". But he said he gave it the go-ahead after being reassured by others. Among them was Peter Mandelson, who was then his trade and industry secretary. There was no indication at this stage that the Horizon software would lead to wrongful accusations of theft but there were concerns about its reliability and ballooning cost. In a letter dated 10 December 1998, Lord Mandelson said he believed the ""only sensible choice"" was to proceed with Horizon. He warned that cancelling the contract would cause ""political fallout"" from post office closures and damage relations with Fujitsu, which he described as a major investor in the UK. The letter, and the submission to Sir Tony, were both previously shown in hearings at the inquiry, which was launched in 2021, but have now been published in full. In 1998 Horizon was being developed by a firm called ICL, owned by Fujitsu, as a way of paying welfare benefits through Post Office counters using a swipe card. Ultimately this element of the project was dropped and the system was rolled out in 1999 for tasks like accounting and stocktaking instead. More than 900 workers were prosecuted after the faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. The Horizon project, which was launched under John Major's Conservative government, was running more than two years behind schedule by 1998. The project was referred up to Sir Tony to decide if it should continue. A submission sent to the then-prime minister on 9 December 1998 by a special adviser at Downing Street, Geoff Mulgan, described the system as ""increasingly flawed"". Mr Mulgan warned that ""in the long-run"" it would ""prove unsatisfactory"" and described it as ""hugely expensive, inflexible, inappropriate and possibly unreliable"". Mr Blair jotted a handwritten note on the document that asked for a ""clear view"" on its reliability. On 14 December 1998, his private secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote to Mr Mulgan to say that the prime minister's ""clear preference would be to avoid cancelling the project"". Witness statements given by other former Labour ministers, including Alistair Darling and Stephen Byers, previously set out how the government came up with a number of options to save the ailing scheme. In his own witness statement, given to the inquiry in 2022, Sir Tony pointed to a letter from Lord Mandelson written on 10 December 1998 as an example of the reassurance he had received. In the letter, Lord Mandelson said ""the basic development work has been thoroughly evaluated by independent experts who have pronounced it viable, robust and of a design which should accommodate future technological developments"". No former minister has said in their evidence to the inquiry that they knew of specific problems which led to sub-postmasters being wrongly accused of theft. Lord Mandelson's letter also warned that if the government cancelled the contract ""our relations with Fujitsu, a major inward investor into the UK over the past decade, would be severely damaged, as would the credibility"" of Private Finance Initiatives or PFIs - then a new method of funding major projects. In September 1998, Fujitsu announced it was closing a semiconductor plant in Sir Tony's Sedgefield constituency in County Durham, with the loss of 600 jobs. In his witness statement, Sir Tony said he was ""naturally concerned"" about the impact of the closure and it was mentioned by him in passing in a letter to the chairman of Fujitsu. However, he said he did not recall this being relevant to the matters being considered by the inquiry. Lord Mandelson's letter, which was sent to the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Byers and copied to the prime minister, also reflected concerns the system was vital for generating the footfall needed to keep post offices open. He wrote that ""the damage to the confidence of sub-postmasters and the knock-on effect of network closures"", which he said would come from cancelling Horizon, ""will produce political fallout, no matter how carefully we try to handle it"". Lord Mandelson's office has been approached for comment. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As the documents show, and make completely clear, Mr Blair took the issue very seriously.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944525,Fujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concerns,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"".",2024-01-12,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"". The Japanese-owned firm is at the heart of the long-running Post Office IT scandal. Court documents reveal the Foreign Office had originally wanted to rehire Vodafone for the contract to supply communications equipment. But it re-ran its procurement following a legal challenge from Fujitsu. Last autumn the most senior civil servant in the department told MPs scrutinising government spending that the programme to replace its communications system would also be 12 months late being delivered. A government spokesperson said, as with all contracts, it continued to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review. Fujitsu declined to comment. Fujitsu was one of three companies bidding for a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) contract in 2021 to replace a system of secure electronic communications connecting civil servants and diplomats across 532 sites in more than 170 countries. Officials had abandoned an earlier procurement process in 2018 following a challenge from Fujitsu. When Vodafone contested the FCDO's decision in the courts it emerged that Fujitsu's winning 2021 bid had been evaluated as having ""significant deficiencies resulting in a technical solution that is likely to be unfit for purpose, and requiring workarounds"". It was nevertheless the highest scoring bid. Vodafone was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to overturn the FCDO's decision. Last October the most senior civil servant in the department wrote to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending, to warn the replacement of the communications system was forecast to be 12 months late in being delivered. MPs from across the House of Commons have questioned why Fujitsu has continued to win government contracts despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that its Horizon system serving the Post Office contained ""bugs, errors and defects"". A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account - legally and financially. ""Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review."" They added that Fujitsu's system has undergone extensive testing to ensure it is ""fit for purpose"" before its deployment to the FCDO's global sites. Digital procurement expert Mike Bracken said governments often signed contracts with suppliers on the basis that any problems would be ironed out once work begins. ""In a world of rapid technology change and changing customer demand, [this] is not very wise,"" he told the BBC. ""It leads to government holding many legacy contracts which are not fit for purpose but are contractually and operationally difficult to move away from."" Mr Bracken, who founded the Government Digital Service before setting up consultancy Public Digital, said governments would be better off ""starting small"" with pilot projects and having shorter contracts. But he added: ""They often prefer to offer one big contract and hope that issues can be worked on as they arise, despite minimal evidence that this ever works."" New procurement rules aimed at strengthening the accountability of suppliers and the government's power to challenge and remove them come into force later this year.

A handwritten note from the then-Labour PM, published by the public inquiry on Friday, suggests he raised concerns after being warned the system was ""possibly unreliable"". But he said he gave it the go-ahead after being reassured by others. Among them was Peter Mandelson, who was then his trade and industry secretary. There was no indication at this stage that the Horizon software would lead to wrongful accusations of theft but there were concerns about its reliability and ballooning cost. In a letter dated 10 December 1998, Lord Mandelson said he believed the ""only sensible choice"" was to proceed with Horizon. He warned that cancelling the contract would cause ""political fallout"" from post office closures and damage relations with Fujitsu, which he described as a major investor in the UK. The letter, and the submission to Sir Tony, were both previously shown in hearings at the inquiry, which was launched in 2021, but have now been published in full. In 1998 Horizon was being developed by a firm called ICL, owned by Fujitsu, as a way of paying welfare benefits through Post Office counters using a swipe card. Ultimately this element of the project was dropped and the system was rolled out in 1999 for tasks like accounting and stocktaking instead. More than 900 workers were prosecuted after the faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. The Horizon project, which was launched under John Major's Conservative government, was running more than two years behind schedule by 1998. The project was referred up to Sir Tony to decide if it should continue. A submission sent to the then-prime minister on 9 December 1998 by a special adviser at Downing Street, Geoff Mulgan, described the system as ""increasingly flawed"". Mr Mulgan warned that ""in the long-run"" it would ""prove unsatisfactory"" and described it as ""hugely expensive, inflexible, inappropriate and possibly unreliable"". Mr Blair jotted a handwritten note on the document that asked for a ""clear view"" on its reliability. On 14 December 1998, his private secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wrote to Mr Mulgan to say that the prime minister's ""clear preference would be to avoid cancelling the project"". Witness statements given by other former Labour ministers, including Alistair Darling and Stephen Byers, previously set out how the government came up with a number of options to save the ailing scheme. In his own witness statement, given to the inquiry in 2022, Sir Tony pointed to a letter from Lord Mandelson written on 10 December 1998 as an example of the reassurance he had received. In the letter, Lord Mandelson said ""the basic development work has been thoroughly evaluated by independent experts who have pronounced it viable, robust and of a design which should accommodate future technological developments"". No former minister has said in their evidence to the inquiry that they knew of specific problems which led to sub-postmasters being wrongly accused of theft. Lord Mandelson's letter also warned that if the government cancelled the contract ""our relations with Fujitsu, a major inward investor into the UK over the past decade, would be severely damaged, as would the credibility"" of Private Finance Initiatives or PFIs - then a new method of funding major projects. In September 1998, Fujitsu announced it was closing a semiconductor plant in Sir Tony's Sedgefield constituency in County Durham, with the loss of 600 jobs. In his witness statement, Sir Tony said he was ""naturally concerned"" about the impact of the closure and it was mentioned by him in passing in a letter to the chairman of Fujitsu. However, he said he did not recall this being relevant to the matters being considered by the inquiry. Lord Mandelson's letter, which was sent to the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Byers and copied to the prime minister, also reflected concerns the system was vital for generating the footfall needed to keep post offices open. He wrote that ""the damage to the confidence of sub-postmasters and the knock-on effect of network closures"", which he said would come from cancelling Horizon, ""will produce political fallout, no matter how carefully we try to handle it"". Lord Mandelson's office has been approached for comment. A spokesperson for Sir Tony said: ""As the documents show, and make completely clear, Mr Blair took the issue very seriously. His response to the Mulgan note, and in other interactions, was to raise the issue of the viability and reliability of the end project as this was his overarching concern. He subsequently received these reassurances.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67954152,Sunak vows that Ukraine will never be alone as he pledges £2.5bn package,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year.",2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak has vowed that Ukraine ""will never be alone"" as the UK announced £2.5bn of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year. It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles.

It is the UK's largest annual commitment since Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The PM made the announcement as he met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and signed the new agreement. Mr Sunak said that the support was vital because if Vladimir Putin ""wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there"". Officials said the package will provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defence and artillery shells. Some £200m will be spent on drones. They said the military package - for the next financial year beginning in April -  would result in the largest delivery of drones, most of which will be UK-made, to Ukraine by any country. Significantly, the prime minister has decided not to make a financial commitment lasting several years. Some ministers and senior military figures had argued privately this would send a stronger signal to Moscow of Britain's long-term support. Instead, Mr Sunak has chosen to spend £200m more than the last two years, when the UK's annual military commitment to Ukraine was worth £2.3bn. Downing Street said the package of support would form the first step in what it called ""an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the UK"". It will also include £18m for humanitarian aid, help fortifying Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told BBC Breakfast the drones will give Ukraine an advantage over the coming years. He said: ""They are drones that are being developed at pace, learning all of the lessons from what we've seen in Ukraine over the last two years."" He added the funding shows the UK is maintaining its leadership position in Europe as the second-biggest donor to Ukraine. During his visit the prime minister met with Mr Zelensky at the Presidential Palace and also met emergency services and residents of Kyiv. Mr Sunak, who last visited Ukraine 15 months ago in November 2022, said: ""I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in better times to come."" ""The UK is already one of Ukraine's closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security,"" he added. ""Today we are going further, increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term. ""For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy."" When asked by BBC News if the UK should have instead announced a multi-year package of funding, the prime minister pointed to the UK being the first ally to sign a long-term security agreement with Ukraine. ""It sends a strong signal to Putin and others that we are here to stay,"" he said. ""We are here to support Ukraine in the long term."" Mr Zelensky hailed Mr Sunak's ""personal leadership"" and said the agreement would lay ""the groundwork for our further work with our other partners"". The UK-Ukraine agreement comprises a raft of bilateral assurances of military and economic support, designed to deter Russian aggression before Ukraine joins Nato. Officials said the UK is the first G7 country to sign such a pact, which all seven leading industrial nations promised to do at the Nato summit in Vilnius last year. The UK commitment comes after months of pressure from MPs, who argued the government should have given Ukraine greater clarity much earlier so it could develop its military planning. It also comes as both the United States and the European Union struggle to agree their own packages of support, with Ukraine in desperate need of more shells and missiles.

The UK and US launched targeted strikes on military facilities overnight following attacks by the armed group on ships in the Red Sea. Mr Sunak stressed the action was ""necessary, proportionate, and targeted"" to protect lives and commercial shipping. In response, Houthi officials warned the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"". The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping last year. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by Houthis in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said. Speaking during a visit to Ukraine, the prime minister said the UK ""acted in self-defence"" following the Houthis' targeting of ships, including a Royal Navy warship on Tuesday. He has called on the group to stop the attacks. ""We've seen a significant increase in in the number of Houthi attacks... that's putting innocent lives at risk. It's disrupting the global economy, and it's also destabilising the region,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And it's why I made the decision with allies to take what I believe to be necessary, proportionate and targeted action against military targets, to degrade and disrupt Houthi capability."" He said: ""It's clear that this type of behaviour can't be met without a response, we need to send a strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong."" Initial indications are the strikes have been successful, according to the Mr Sunak. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said there were no further air strikes ""immediately planned"". The strikes have also been backed by Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was briefed by the government on Thursday night. ""Clearly the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have to be dealt with,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran called for Parliament to be recalled immediately for a retrospective vote on the strikes, and asked if the UK was being drawn into something that risked it being on the frontline in a region she described as a ""tinderbox"". The SNP have also said any military action should be scrutinised in the Commons. The prime minister said he will make a full statement in Parliament and take questions on Monday. The government has also published a summary of its legal position for the military strikes. It stated the UK was permitted under international law to use force when acting in self-defence. Former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt told the BBC there was responsibility on the UK and US as permanent members of the UN Security Council to take action to protect world trade. ""One has to hope that this is calculated measured intelligence-led activity, which will have an effect quite quickly and restore international shipping to be able to use the Red Sea as opposed to going around the very expensive Cape of Good Hope route."" Former UK national security adviser Lord Ricketts said the strikes on Houthi sites were ""inevitable"" when the group ignored warnings and following the attack on US and UK naval ships on Tuesday. ""I think [the US-led coalition] tried to make it large enough to send a very powerful message but equally being clear its targeted against the attacks on shipping, it's not the declaration of war against the Houthis more generally,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"". The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel. ""We affirm that there is absolutely no justification for this aggression against Yemen, as there was no threat to international navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said. Houthis control north Yemen, capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline. The armed group declares themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and wider West. Yemen expert Dr Elisabeth Kendall, from the University of Cambridge, said she did not think Houthis wanted war with the US, but conflict could help them domestically and increase their leverage in talks with Saudi Arabia, which wants to end its nearly decade long conflict with group. ""You can do a lot of damage as a small group without very sophisticated weapons when you're sitting at the mouth of ones of the world's most important trade routes,"" she told BBC News. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the strikes. It will take place on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry expressed ""great concern"" over the air strikes. On Wednesday the UN Security Council passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to Houthi attacks, with the text endorsed the right of UN member states to defend their vessels. Some major shipping lines and oil giant BP have diverted vessels around southern Africa, adding time and costs to journeys. If the crisis continues, the increased costs could be passed on to consumers, hampering efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944525,Fujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concerns,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"".",2024-01-12,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"". The Japanese-owned firm is at the heart of the long-running Post Office IT scandal. Court documents reveal the Foreign Office had originally wanted to rehire Vodafone for the contract to supply communications equipment. But it re-ran its procurement following a legal challenge from Fujitsu. Last autumn the most senior civil servant in the department told MPs scrutinising government spending that the programme to replace its communications system would also be 12 months late being delivered. A government spokesperson said, as with all contracts, it continued to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review. Fujitsu declined to comment. Fujitsu was one of three companies bidding for a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) contract in 2021 to replace a system of secure electronic communications connecting civil servants and diplomats across 532 sites in more than 170 countries. Officials had abandoned an earlier procurement process in 2018 following a challenge from Fujitsu. When Vodafone contested the FCDO's decision in the courts it emerged that Fujitsu's winning 2021 bid had been evaluated as having ""significant deficiencies resulting in a technical solution that is likely to be unfit for purpose, and requiring workarounds"". It was nevertheless the highest scoring bid. Vodafone was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to overturn the FCDO's decision. Last October the most senior civil servant in the department wrote to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending, to warn the replacement of the communications system was forecast to be 12 months late in being delivered. MPs from across the House of Commons have questioned why Fujitsu has continued to win government contracts despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that its Horizon system serving the Post Office contained ""bugs, errors and defects"". A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account - legally and financially. ""Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review."" They added that Fujitsu's system has undergone extensive testing to ensure it is ""fit for purpose"" before its deployment to the FCDO's global sites. Digital procurement expert Mike Bracken said governments often signed contracts with suppliers on the basis that any problems would be ironed out once work begins. ""In a world of rapid technology change and changing customer demand, [this] is not very wise,"" he told the BBC. ""It leads to government holding many legacy contracts which are not fit for purpose but are contractually and operationally difficult to move away from."" Mr Bracken, who founded the Government Digital Service before setting up consultancy Public Digital, said governments would be better off ""starting small"" with pilot projects and having shorter contracts. But he added: ""They often prefer to offer one big contract and hope that issues can be worked on as they arise, despite minimal evidence that this ever works."" New procurement rules aimed at strengthening the accountability of suppliers and the government's power to challenge and remove them come into force later this year.

Downing Street briefed Sir Keir Starmer and Commons' Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle shortly before air strikes began on Thursday evening. Parliament had already risen for the weekend. The Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru have urged it to be recalled to hold a vote on the military action. Downing Street has said there are ""no plans for a retrospective vote"" as parliamentary approval is not required for military action. Commons votes have been held on most armed interventions since the 2003 Iraq war, but constitutionally only the prime minister can authorise strikes. Overnight on Thursday, a US-led air strike hit more than 70 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Houthis say five of their members were killed and six others injured. The action was the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year. The airstrike will not go without ""punishment or retaliation"", the group's leadership have warned. The Houthi movement is a political and military group which controls a large part of Yemen and says it is supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party was ""fully supportive"" of the military action aimed at preventing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. ""I want the prime minister to make a statement as soon as possible, but the principle of taking action against the Houthi rebels is really important,"" he added. But Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that the UK and US action could set ""the region alight"". Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, described the strikes as ""a reckless act of escalation"" and said it ""is utterly disgraceful that Parliament has not even been consulted"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he had ""made representations"" to Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden who gave the briefing on Thursday evening, for the Commons ""to be informed at the earliest possible opportunity"" about the military action. He said he was ""happy to facilitate a recall at any time"". Scotland's First Minister, and SNP leader, Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action, lending his support for the Westminster parliament to be recalled. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey says his party is ""minded to approve"" military action in the Yemen but he says it's a matter of principle that the government should seek the approval of parliament. The party is demanding a recall, saying MPs should not be ""by-passed"". ""When it comes to military action and putting military people on the frontline, it is important that MPs take that incredibly seriously and have that debate,"" the party's foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said. MPs must hear the government's reasoning for the strikes and contingency plans for retaliatory measures because ""this could well not be the end of it"", she added. The prime minister has said he will make a Commons statement on Monday - after he returns from a visit to Ukraine, but a vote is thought to be unlikely. Asked why he had not recalled Parliament ahead of the military action, Mr Sunak argued the action taken was ""limited and necessary"". He accused the Houthis of acting ""with impunity"", and said their behaviour needed to be responded to with a ""strong signal that this breach of international law is wrong"". In an effort to reassure MPs, Mr Sunak has published a summary of the legal advice which underpinned the military action. Government lawyers said the strikes were legally taken to ""downgrade the Houthi's capabilities and deter further attacks"". While there is no suggestion that further action is imminent, the BBC understands if another intervention does become necessary, new legal advice will have to be sought. Ministers have told the BBC that the timing of the strikes could not be determined by the UK government alone, as this was a US-led operation. It is likely we will hear calls for a parliamentary vote in advance of any further action - should any be deemed necessary - when MPs meet on Monday. The House of Commons Library suggests that, on the basis of recent military operations, prior approval is now required when military action is taken. But the Institute for Government think tank points out the guidance is ""far from clear cut"". So, what are the rules?

Kevin Hollinrake said that people found to be responsible for the scandal ""must be held to account"" after the official inquiry reaches a verdict. He added that he didn't think there was a ""hope in hell"" of the Post Office bringing private prosecutions. Hundreds were wrongly prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 after being falsely accused of stealing money. There were more than 900 convictions linked to the scandal, with only 93 so far being overturned, after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing from accounts. The government has pledged to bring in a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate victims"" of the scandal. Speaking on the BBC's Any Questions show, Mr Hollinrake said: ""If it's individuals, those people can be criminally prosecuted, potentially, and potentially can go to jail. ""I think we'd all like to see that kind of route taken. People must be held to account."" Asked if he wants to see those responsible from the Post Office jailed, he replied: ""I absolutely do"", adding that it would be the ""ultimate deterrent"". The Post Office scandal has been thrust back into the limelight in recent weeks after the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office was broadcast. An inquiry into the scandal re-started on Thursday, with ex-Post Office investigator Stephen Bradshaw denying he and colleagues behaved like ""mafia gangsters"" towards wrongly accused sub-postmasters. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons on Wednesday that those previously convicted in England and Wales would be cleared of wrongdoing and compensated under a new law. The Scottish government also announced similar plans for those convicted in Scotland, which has a separate legal system. Downing Street said its aim was to complete the process of overturning the convictions of those affected by the end of 2024.","['Post Office Inquiry', 'Post Office Ltd']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1F71/production/_132294080_mediaitem132290829.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png']","['By George Wright', 'BBC News']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944687,Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill,Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill.,2024-01-12,"Rishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has warned she will vote against it unless he accepts ""improvements"" to strengthen the legislation. More than 50 MPs on the right of the party, including Liz Truss, are now backing moves to toughen up the bill. The prime minister is trying to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda after the Supreme Court ruled the earlier scheme was unlawful. Meanwhile, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, has backed three amendments which would tone down some parts of the bill. Mrs Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak in November, told GB News the current version of the bill ""does not work"" and would amount to ""a betrayal to the British public"". The legislation will return to the Commons next Tuesday and Wednesday, when MPs will debate and vote on a series of amendments. It will then face a final Commons vote which it must clear to be sent to the Lords for further scrutiny. Asked how she would vote at this stage if there were no changes, Mrs Braverman replied: ""If there are no improvements to it, I will have to vote against it, I'm afraid. I am sent to Parliament to vote for things, to be for things or to be against them, not to sit on the fence. ""I owe it to the British people to be transparent and honest about the situation that we are in. It is absolutely essential that we deliver on this pledge to stop the boats."" Writing on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, former prime minister Ms Truss said: ""We need to crack down on illegal migration and remove the loopholes being exploited by activist lawyers. ""It's essential the legislation we are passing is watertight. That's why I am backing amendments to the Bill."" Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned last month over the legislation and is co-ordinating a series of rebel amendments, has warned the bill as it stands is ""guaranteed to fail"". Illegal migrants would continue to successfully challenge their removal in court, in a fresh ""merry-go-round"" of appeals, he said. The government insists the legislation, the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, will allow only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. But the amendments backed by Sir Robert would delete clauses from the bill declaring Rwanda ""a safe country"", disapplying the Human Rights Act, and forcing courts to disregard interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The One Nation group is the largest single faction within the Conservative parliamentary party. It says more than 100 MPs are members, almost a third of the total. It argues that the UK's human rights obligations in international law must be respected. Former first secretary of state Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he had been assured the bill would not be strengthened. ""The prime minister's looked me in the eye and said that he doesn't want to go any further,"" he told the New Statesman. The Rwandan government has said it will pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said the government would carry on talking to MPs and ""carefully consider"" amendments put forward. It had worked to ensure the bill was ""robust"", No 10 added. Before Christmas, Mr Sunak comfortably saw off a Tory rebellion over the bill, when it cleared its first Commons hurdle by a majority of 44 votes. But the scale of party divisions on the issue has again been highlighted in recent days - with a number of former cabinet ministers, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, backing the amendments from MPs on the right of the party. Nearly two years after Boris Johnson's government first announced plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, none has been sent to the east African country. The bill aims to stop flights being grounded by legal action by declaring that, in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country. It would enable ministers to ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight there while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it would still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore ECHR injunctions, blocking flights. The prime minister has promised to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and argues his Rwanda scheme will prove a significant deterrent. Labour says the scheme is a hugely expensive ""gimmick"" which will not work, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused Mr Sunak of being ""taken hostage by his own party"". It says it would tackle illegal migration by prioritising the smashing of people-smuggling gangs. The government has a working Commons majority over other parties and independent MPs of 56, implying that 29 Conservative MPs would need to vote against the bill to defeat it. But in practice that majority is larger because some independent MPs usually vote with the government and others tend to be absent. In addition to this, some Tory rebels are likely to abstain, while others may also vote with the government. If the bill does clear its Commons stages, it is likely to face prolonged opposition in the Lords. Meanwhile, the Home Office has published a report on ""safe and legal routes"" for migrants seeking to enter the UK, but it does not list any new routes. Campaigners have long argued that the government needs to provide safe routes for people seeking refuge from war and oppression, to help tackle illegal migration. During debates on the Illegal Migration Act, which became law in July 2023 and bars anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum, ministers promised to ""specify additional safe and legal routes"". No 10 said there were already a significant number of routes and its priority was to secure the UK's borders. ""While the compassion of the UK is clearly unlimited, our capacity is not,"" the prime minister's spokesman added. In a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the report reaffirmed the government's ""commitment to providing safe and legal routes for those most in need"". ""As we get control on numbers, we will keep under review whether we are able to do more to support vulnerable refugees and whether we need to consider new safe and legal routes,"" he added. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon described the report as ""woefully inadequate with no meaningful commitment to expand safe routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Syria, and those fleeing repressive regimes in countries such as Iran"". ""By simply focusing on describing the existing limited schemes, the government has completely overlooked the urgent need to reduce dangerous Channel crossings by providing safe passage to our shores,"" he said.","['Conservative Party', 'Rwanda', 'Migration', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Liz Truss', 'Suella Braverman', 'Refugees and asylum seekers', 'UK immigration', 'Robert Buckland']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13E01/production/_132290418_e37113d501a071f307251cbc00b0b4db9a8d54ba.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C14F/production/_132278494_49df87243c4fd2e37537c4637e12e27615f254c3.jpg']","['By Chas Geiger', 'Political reporter']",UK,Politics

The decision to commit the UK to military action is a landmark moment in any prime minister's tenure in office. The government has the prerogative to do this without wider political consultation. But in this instance, ministers concluded there was sufficient time to brief the cabinet, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle before any strikes began. Sir Lindsay and Mr Healey attended a briefing in person in Whitehall. Sir Keir joined the briefing remotely. 'I understand the briefing was conducted by the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. These conversations are a courtesy. But they are more than a courtesy. Ministers are aware of the scepticism, in parliament and beyond, about the wisdom, or lack of it attached to British military operations over recent decades. Take the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, until very recently a minister himself. Writing on social media, he said: ""Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front: What counts as success? Realistically, how far [would] we need to go to achieve this? How will we avoid being dragged into something we don't want?"" For his part, the prime minister said in a statement that the Houthi attacks ""cannot stand"". He continued: ""The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade. We have therefore taken limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"". And it is likely there will be a statement and a debate in the Commons, perhaps on Monday, with the government pressed to elaborate on just these kind of points: what it hopes to achieve, by when and at what cost. Not soon enough, some will argue. We have already heard from the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru. The Lib Dems and Plaid say it is wrong that parliament has been bypassed. The SNP leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: ""It is incumbent upon the UK Government to appraise Parliament as soon as possible and MPs must therefore be recalled to Westminster"". This moment has looked increasingly likely: a military response to match the rhetoric threatening just that. It was impossible not to join the dots when Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was asked on Wednesday about the prospect of military action against Houthis and said: ""Watch this space."" He could have ducked the question. He instead implied something was coming. So, what next, diplomatically, geopolitically, militarily and economically? There are risks associated with action. And risks associated with doing nothing. The risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East? A further shrivelling of shipping traffic through the Red Sea, a vital artery of the world economy? Let's see. And all this after the twin global shocks of the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic. More uncertainty beckons: unknown consequences abound.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67944525,Fujitsu won Foreign Office contract despite concerns,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"".",2024-01-12,"Fujitsu won a £184m government contract in 2021 despite concerns from officials that the system it was offering was likely to be ""unfit for purpose"". The Japanese-owned firm is at the heart of the long-running Post Office IT scandal. Court documents reveal the Foreign Office had originally wanted to rehire Vodafone for the contract to supply communications equipment. But it re-ran its procurement following a legal challenge from Fujitsu. Last autumn the most senior civil servant in the department told MPs scrutinising government spending that the programme to replace its communications system would also be 12 months late being delivered. A government spokesperson said, as with all contracts, it continued to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review. Fujitsu declined to comment. Fujitsu was one of three companies bidding for a Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) contract in 2021 to replace a system of secure electronic communications connecting civil servants and diplomats across 532 sites in more than 170 countries. Officials had abandoned an earlier procurement process in 2018 following a challenge from Fujitsu. When Vodafone contested the FCDO's decision in the courts it emerged that Fujitsu's winning 2021 bid had been evaluated as having ""significant deficiencies resulting in a technical solution that is likely to be unfit for purpose, and requiring workarounds"". It was nevertheless the highest scoring bid. Vodafone was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to overturn the FCDO's decision. Last October the most senior civil servant in the department wrote to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises government spending, to warn the replacement of the communications system was forecast to be 12 months late in being delivered. MPs from across the House of Commons have questioned why Fujitsu has continued to win government contracts despite a High Court judge ruling in 2019 that its Horizon system serving the Post Office contained ""bugs, errors and defects"". A government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account - legally and financially. ""Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu's conduct and commercial performance under review."" They added that Fujitsu's system has undergone extensive testing to ensure it is ""fit for purpose"" before its deployment to the FCDO's global sites. Digital procurement expert Mike Bracken said governments often signed contracts with suppliers on the basis that any problems would be ironed out once work begins. ""In a world of rapid technology change and changing customer demand, [this] is not very wise,"" he told the BBC. ""It leads to government holding many legacy contracts which are not fit for purpose but are contractually and operationally difficult to move away from."" Mr Bracken, who founded the Government Digital Service before setting up consultancy Public Digital, said governments would be better off ""starting small"" with pilot projects and having shorter contracts. But he added: ""They often prefer to offer one big contract and hope that issues can be worked on as they arise, despite minimal evidence that this ever works."" New procurement rules aimed at strengthening the accountability of suppliers and the government's power to challenge and remove them come into force later this year.

The figure for 2020-22 was revealed in a Foreign Office report. Foreign Office Minister Andrew Mitchell said all events organised by Government Hospitality during this period were ""in strict accordance with Covid-19 restrictions"". He highlighted figures from the report showing use of the cellar fell by 96% in 2020 to 2021. Some 130 bottles were drunk during this period, compared with 3,336 in 2019 to 2020. The figures increased between 2021 and 2022 to 1,303, but were still well below pre-pandemic levels. The alcohol, stored in the basement of Lancaster House in central London, is given to guests of the government. The wine cellar is expected to finance itself through sales of some of its high value stock and payments from other government departments. However, sales were not possible during the pandemic, only resuming in 2022. A hospitality fund was originally set up in 1908 to provide for ""high-level visiting overseas government guests and domestic guests"". In 1922 a committee was established to purchase alcohol and the Government Hospitality wine cellar was created. After the outbreak of World War Two, the cellar was topped up with wines requisitioned from the German Embassy and for part of the conflict, some of the cellar was relocated to Warwickshire ""for safe keeping"". A 2010 review concluded that the cellar was delivering value for money but recommended it should be a ""self-financing regime for the medium term, with targeted sales of high value stock helping to pay for future purchases"". These days the Government Wine Committee, which meets around three times a year, advises Government Hospitality on purchasing new stock. The committee is chaired by former diplomat Sir David Wright and the committee members are unpaid. The overall market value of the cellar's contents is estimated to be £3.66m, compared to £3.34m two years before. Between 2020 and 2021, £14,621 was spent on 516 bottles of Bordeaux, costing around £28 each. The following year, £12,356 went towards purchasing 636 bottles of English and Welsh sparkling wines,18 bottles of gin, and four bottles each of whisky and liqueurs. The pandemic prevented any sales of stock between 2020 and 2021 but they restarted in 2022. Responding to the report, Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said: ""For months we have asked why the government was suppressing the publication of this report, and now we know the answer. ""While the rest of the country was facing Covid restrictions and a cost-of-living crisis, the government was getting through 1,433 bottles from its wine cellar, and replenishing the stocks with a net spend of more than £100,000 over the three years from 2019-22.

The Treasury has modelled scenarios suggesting that disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the UK economy, risking a recession. The main fear in the Treasury's analyses is of a rise of at least $10 per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas. Rises such as these have not actually materialised, so far, mainly because of the actions of Saudi Arabia - the major oil producing nation - in soothing global energy markets with price cuts. The US and UK will hope that their overnight strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels will help reverse widespread delays and disruption to Red Sea trading routes, by re-establishing safe passage through the Bab-al-Mandeb Strait into the Suez Canal. But, on the other hand, there is now also a clear pathway of escalation to a wider Middle East conflict. Oil prices had fallen quite significantly before this, helping petrol prices drop below £1.40 a litre to a two-year low. And on Friday, while prices rose by 4%, they are still a relatively manageable $80 per barrel. But disruption to cargo traffic risks spreading from the Red Sea across the Arabian Peninsula to the Strait of Hormuz, another key trading route. On Thursday, Iran's navy seized a US-linked oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman as part of a long-running row between the two nations. If that situation also escalates, another energy shock is possible with the risk of $100 per barrel of oil on the horizon - just as the impact of the Ukraine crisis was fading. Meanwhile, Europe is now much more physically dependent on flows of shipped gas from Qatar, after supplies from Russian pipelines were stopped. European energy majors have been queuing up to do deals with Doha after Russian taps were turned off. Even if physical supplies could be made up from the US - now the world largest exporter of liquified natural gas - the price would surge on any disruption in the Gulf. A serious escalation could further disrupt the global economy, entrenching inflation, just as the world's central banks were pondering turning points and cutting interest rates. It would also mark clear parallels with the 1970s, when two separate geopolitical energy shocks from the Arab-Israeli War and the Iranian Revolution led to prolonged inflation over several years. So action taken to protect the world economy, is even on that basis alone, not without its risks.","['Suez canal', 'Yemen crisis', 'Yemen', 'Oil']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AA59/production/_132290634_tankernew.png'],,UK,Politics

But in this instance, ministers concluded there was sufficient time to brief the cabinet, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle before any strikes began. Sir Lindsay and Mr Healey attended a briefing in person in Whitehall. Sir Keir joined the briefing remotely. 'I understand the briefing was conducted by the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. These conversations are a courtesy. But they are more than a courtesy. Ministers are aware of the scepticism, in parliament and beyond, about the wisdom, or lack of it attached to British military operations over recent decades. Take the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, until very recently a minister himself. Writing on social media, he said: ""Given our main interventions of the last 25 years have been failures, let's be clear up front: What counts as success? Realistically, how far [would] we need to go to achieve this? How will we avoid being dragged into something we don't want?"" For his part, the prime minister said in a statement that the Houthi attacks ""cannot stand"". He continued: ""The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade. We have therefore taken limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"". And it is likely there will be a statement and a debate in the Commons, perhaps on Monday, with the government pressed to elaborate on just these kind of points: what it hopes to achieve, by when and at what cost. Not soon enough, some will argue. We have already heard from the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru. The Lib Dems and Plaid say it is wrong that parliament has been bypassed. The SNP leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: ""It is incumbent upon the UK Government to appraise Parliament as soon as possible and MPs must therefore be recalled to Westminster"". This moment has looked increasingly likely: a military response to match the rhetoric threatening just that. It was impossible not to join the dots when Defence Secretary Grant Shapps was asked on Wednesday about the prospect of military action against Houthis and said: ""Watch this space."" He could have ducked the question. He instead implied something was coming. So, what next, diplomatically, geopolitically, militarily and economically? There are risks associated with action. And risks associated with doing nothing. The risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East? A further shrivelling of shipping traffic through the Red Sea, a vital artery of the world economy? Let's see. And all this after the twin global shocks of the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic. More uncertainty beckons: unknown consequences abound.

The proposed site would generate enough power for 45,000 homes and save more than three million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to developers. But those opposed say the levels should be protected from development as a site of special scientific interest (SSI). More than 2,000 people have signed a petition calling for more protection. The petition launched by the Gwent Wildlife Trust has called for a ""halt to significant development on the levels until full, formal protection for the landscape has been agreed"". The charity has already halted a scheme to build the M4 relief road through the area, an area of wetland between east Cardiff and Chepstow, Monmouthshire. The developer of the proposed solar farm - between the M4 and Llanwern Steelworks near Newport and called Craig y Perthi - said the opportunities for wildlife were ""enormous"". But campaigners said they were concerned about the site, 20% of which would be in a site of an SSSI and surround the community from three sides. Adam Taylor, chief executive of the Gwent Wildlife Trust, said: ""The Gwent Levels are one of the most threatened SSSIs in Wales. ""SSIs only cover 8% of the area of the whole of Wales, and we think these sites should be sacrosanct and shouldn't be subject to development. Ninety-two percent of Wales is available for solar and other sustainable developments and we would recommend that these developments take place there instead"". Campaigners say planning laws need to be amended to protect the long-term future of the Gwent Levels. Mike Webb, from the Gwent Wildlife Trust, said: ""It's been here for thousands of years. It's the result of the interaction of humans with nature. ""We're not calling for a moratorium on every single, small for example domestic planning application. It's a moratorium on major developments on the levels."" Diana Callaghan, who has lived in the area for 25 years, said: ""It's a wonderful place to be, but as a resident I fear this area is really under threat. ""We can't keep covering our landscape with plastic and glass and buildings and cement, because the planet needs green space to survive as well"". Robin Johnson of JMB Solar, part of power generating company RWE, and project manager for the site, said he recognised how important it was to look after the wildlife benefits of the solar farm. He said: ""The opportunities for wildlife here are enormous. ""With a solar farm you are only penetrating about 1% of the ground because panels sit above ground, and underneath the panels you have a diverse grassland which encourages the local wildlife, especially reptiles and birds that can thrive on a solar site as opposed to an intensively managed agricultural site."" About 5,000 people have signed the petition so far, which needs 10,000 signatures by late January to be debated in the Senedd. The Welsh government said: ""We are working on strategic planning guidance to protect the Gwent Levels from unacceptable biodiversity and landscape impacts. ""We have also updated national planning policy to ensure there is enhanced protection for all sites of special scientific interest.""","['Bishton', 'Wales', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Solar power']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0CD2/production/_130828230_gettyimages-1371860702.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1835F/production/_132276199_adamtaylorchiefexecgwentwildlifetrust.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E71F/production/_132276195_dianacallaghan-resident.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1353F/production/_132276197_robinjohnsonprojectmanagerrwe.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/94AD/production/_127816083_bbc_header_grey_8-1x-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/BBBD/production/_127816084_bbc_footer-1920x38-1x-1.jpg']","['By Garry Owen', 'BBC News']",Business,New Tech Economy
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67576918,Why is the world investing so much in semiconductors?,"I'm at the UK's newest computer chip plant in Durham. Formerly a ceramic pipe factory, from the outside it looks like a  big warehouse.",2024-01-12,"I'm at the UK's newest computer chip plant in Durham. Formerly a ceramic pipe factory, from the outside it looks like a  big warehouse. But inside the vast space is being transformed into a sophisticated hub for the manufacturing of computer chips. Pragmatic Semiconductor has already built one production line, which the industry likes to call fabrication lines, or fab lines. Sealed off in its own large room, the production line has all the expensive machinery needed to make the computer chips, and the air inside is carefully controlled to avoid any contamination during production. Pragmatic has the money to build another such production line, and funding of £182m ($230m) announced late last year will fund production lines three and four. As well as from private investors, Pragmatic secured funding from the government-backed UK Infrastructure Bank and British Patient Capital, a subsidiary of British Business Bank. But the Cambridge-based company will need much more money to complete its plan to build eight production lines in the old pipe factory. From phones and computers, to cars and washing machines, almost every product with an on-off switch relies on the production of computer chips, also known as semiconductors. It is an industry that has seen a lot of turbulence over the last few years. There's been disruption to supply chains during the pandemic, and geopolitical tensions in Asia, where 90% of the world's most advanced chips originate. David Moore, chief executive of Pragmatic Semiconductor, which is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the UK, says the industry is going to need multiple types of semiconductors to solve ""different kinds of problems"" in the chip sector. Most semiconductors are made using silicon, but his company is taking a different approach. They are making flexible chips - they actually bend - at their plant in Durham, which can be used in wearable technology, clothing authentication, and even in parcel labels to track and trace items. Rather than sitting on silicon wafer, Pragmatic's chips are built on a flexible thin film. This approach results in chips that are cheaper and faster to manufacture than the standard silicon chip. ""If you take a standard silicon manufacturing facility, it's going to take multiple years and billions of dollars to make,"" Mr Moore said. ""Our fabrication plant can be 10 to 100 times cheaper depending on what you compare it with. ""In silicon, it will take three to six months to go from the start of the process all the way to a finished wafer product. For us, we can do that in less than 48 hours."" But it is no panacea. The flexible chip may be cheaper and quicker to make, but the advanced chips in phones, computers and other leading tech will still need the most advanced silicon-based computer chips. More technology of business A serious shortage of those chips in 2021, underlined how dependent global industry is on a few key suppliers. In particular, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) makes 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors. In an effort to cut that dependency governments are spending huge sums to create stronger domestic chip industries. In August 2022, the US government signed into law the US Chips Act, which pledged $52bn (£41bn) to boost domestic production of computer chips. The European Union has its own project worth €43bn (£37bn). On a smaller scale the UK has promised £1bn of investment in the sector. Analysts says that the big chip manufacturers are responding to such government incentives. Germany has seen a huge wave of investment. A Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer has decided, together with three European headquartered companies, to invest €10bn in Dresden. ""We see that 80% of of global production is currently in Asia, the reliance on Asian countries means we really need to strengthen our resilience here in the EU,"" notes Hendrik Abma, director general of the European Semiconductor Industry Association. ""I think the realisation about the importance of semiconductors for industry here in Europe, for our technical development, has been underestimated in the past."" As well as Germany, Mr Abma notes that Belgium, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, have seen significant investments. Following the US Chips Act, almost 500 companies applied to the US government for funding for projects, according to Hannah Dohmen, research analyst at Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington. Plants are planned in New York, Arizona, Texas, Ohio and Idaho, she says. And outside the US and Europe, other projects are planned. ""We're also seeing India attempt to enter the chip manufacturing space. A country that has a strong history in chip design but will be starting from scratch in manufacturing,"" Ms Dohmen added. ""India are looking to be a big player in the space, and with intensifying competition with China. This has prompted the US and other allied countries to strengthen tech cooperation with India."" It all sounds very positive but building computer chip plants is not easy. Plans by TSMC to build advanced chips in Arizona have run into trouble, with the company blaming a shortage of skilled workers. Others worry that the rush to build plants in Europe and the US, will just mirror what already exists in Asia. ""There's a risk of duplication and wastefulness across the industry,"" Ms Dohmen said. Meanwhile, Mr Moore predicts more diversification in how semiconductors are made and what they're used for. ""You go from tens of billions of connected things to hundreds of billions and trillions of connected things, ultimately you end up with that very challenging element of not being able to supply to it, and so alternative supplies in high volume are what are going to be required. ""And being able to provide those cost effectively and at scale - that's the big challenge.""","['Semiconductors', 'Technology of Business']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/141C1/production/_131896328_pragmaticpark.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13C45/production/_132256908_stb_0749-14.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EE25/production/_132256906_gettyimages-1725795545.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A005/production/_132256904_gettyimages-1320113349.jpg']","['By Hannah Mullane', 'Business Reporter, BBC News']",Business,Technology of Business

""We see that 80% of of global production is currently in Asia, the reliance on Asian countries means we really need to strengthen our resilience here in the EU,"" notes Hendrik Abma, director general of the European Semiconductor Industry Association. ""I think the realisation about the importance of semiconductors for industry here in Europe, for our technical development, has been underestimated in the past."" As well as Germany, Mr Abma notes that Belgium, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, have seen significant investments. Following the US Chips Act, almost 500 companies applied to the US government for funding for projects, according to Hannah Dohmen, research analyst at Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology in Washington. Plants are planned in New York, Arizona, Texas, Ohio and Idaho, she says. And outside the US and Europe, other projects are planned. ""We're also seeing India attempt to enter the chip manufacturing space. A country that has a strong history in chip design but will be starting from scratch in manufacturing,"" Ms Dohmen added. ""India are looking to be a big player in the space, and with intensifying competition with China. This has prompted the US and other allied countries to strengthen tech cooperation with India."" It all sounds very positive but building computer chip plants is not easy. Plans by TSMC to build advanced chips in Arizona have run into trouble, with the company blaming a shortage of skilled workers. Others worry that the rush to build plants in Europe and the US, will just mirror what already exists in Asia. ""There's a risk of duplication and wastefulness across the industry,"" Ms Dohmen said. Meanwhile, Mr Moore predicts more diversification in how semiconductors are made and what they're used for. ""You go from tens of billions of connected things to hundreds of billions and trillions of connected things, ultimately you end up with that very challenging element of not being able to supply to it, and so alternative supplies in high volume are what are going to be required. ""And being able to provide those cost effectively and at scale - that's the big challenge.""","['Semiconductors', 'Technology of Business']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/141C1/production/_131896328_pragmaticpark.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13C45/production/_132256908_stb_0749-14.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5733/production/_107332322_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EE25/production/_132256906_gettyimages-1725795545.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A005/production/_132256904_gettyimages-1320113349.jpg']","['By Hannah Mullane', 'Business Reporter, BBC News']",Tech,Tech

Research published by Prof Robin Bryant found an increase in the defacement of churches, castles and monasteries in an area of Kent. Mr Bryant, from Canterbury Christ Church University, believes AI could be used to ""link offences together"". It is hoped the technology could identify offenders by tracking tags and matching graffiti in other areas. The new research, funded by Historic England, and published by Mr Bryant, who is director of criminal justice practice at Canterbury Christ Church University, analysed crimes recorded over a four year period across Kent and Medway. It found 8% of all recorded crime and anti-social behaviour occurs within, at, or close to, a protected heritage site. Mr Bryant said: ""Our best estimates suggest that currently approximately one in five listed buildings and one in four places of worship in Kent and Medway experience some form of crime each year. ""AI offers the possibility to link offences together to the same offenders. In classic policing terms, this is normally a very good start in terms of an investigation."" Mark Harrison, head of heritage crime at Historic England, said the research presented an exciting opportunity to investigate graffiti within the ""historic environment"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67947795,Oil prices rise on US-UK strikes over Red Sea attacks,Oil prices jumped by 4% after the US and UK launched strikes in Yemen over recent attacks by Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea.,2024-01-12,"Oil prices jumped by 4% after the US and UK launched strikes in Yemen over recent attacks by Houthi rebels on ships in the Red Sea. Brent crude hit $80 per barrel for the first time this year as the Iran-backed rebels vowed to retaliate against military action by Western powers. While the price rose, it is below highs reached when Russia invaded Ukraine. But the UK government has drawn up scenarios suggesting further disruption could hit the economy. The BBC understands the Treasury has modelled outcomes including crude oil prices rising by more than $10 a barrel and a 25% increase in natural gas. On Friday, Brent Crude - the international benchmark for oil prices for much of the world - hit $80.71 per barrel before easing, while US West Texas crude increased by 2.79% to $74.03. The UK government is concerned that ongoing attacks on shipping in the Red Sea could weigh on the UK economy, where growth remains fragile. Higher energy prices risk stoking inflation just as it has begun to slow. Meanwhile, the cost of shipping containers on vessels has jumped, meaning that companies could choose to pass on this expense to consumers. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that the attacks had caused ""major disruption to a vital trade route and [higher] commodity prices"". But Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, pointed out that energy prices are still considerably lower than they were four months ago. ""At these levels, it is actually quite disinflationary for the UK economy,"" he said. He added that when the Bank of England comes to make its next interest rate decision in February, oil prices are still likely to be some 20% lower than they were in the autumn. Houthi rebels in Yemen have stepped up attacks on commercial vessels since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The US said there had been 27 attacks in the Red Sea since mid-November. The group has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Ships usually take this key trade route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north. Many companies are now sending vessels around the Cape of Good Hope instead, a route that adds at least 10 days of travel. On Friday, shipping data showed that at least four oil tankers changed course since the overnight strikes by the US and the UK. Danish fuel tanker giant Torm also said that it had stopped allowing its fleet to sail through the southern Red Sea, while Intertanko, which represents nearly 70% of all internationally traded oil, gas and chemical tankers, is currently urging its members to avoid the Bal al-Mandab straight for several days and turn off their transmitters. Currently, about a quarter of the world's shipping containers are being diverted. According to the White House, about 15% of global seaborne trade passes through the Red Sea. This includes 8% of global grain, 12% of seaborne oil and 8% of the world's liquified natural gas. Vincent Clerc, chief executive of Maersk, the shipping giant, told the BBC that ""significant disruption"" to global trade was already being felt ""down to the end consumer"". Several companies have said they have already seen, or are expecting, a knock-on effect: The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, although it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel. As a result of the attacks, Maersk and several of the world's other major shipping lines have been avoiding a key route for global trade as they prioritise the safety of their crews. ""We have ships that are being shot at. We have colleagues whose lives are at risk when this happens and we can simply not justify sailing through these danger zones the way the situation is right now,"" Mr Clerc said. He said the longer route around Africa was sucking capacity out of the global shipping system in the short term, adding anything from seven days to two weeks to a ship's journey, as well as costing $1m (£783,000) more in fuel alone. Rates for moving cargo by sea reached record highs during the pandemic. Since the attacks on vessels started in the region, prices for both container transport and that of goods have again surged. According to the Drewry World Container Index, pricing for a 40ft container hit $3,072 on 11 January, prior to the US and UK strikes carried out on Houthi targets in Yemen. In Bahrain on a tour of the Middle East this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said extra costs get ""translated into higher prices for people, for everything from fuel to medicine to food"". ""And so it's having a real impact on people around the world in their daily lives.""","['Shipping containers', 'Trade', 'Economy', 'Global supply chain management', 'Tesla', 'Shipping industry', 'Houthis', 'Global trade']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/01DE/production/_132287400_ship.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4E78/production/_132288002_shippingmap.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/8B54/production/_132286653_world-container-index-nc.png']","['By Lora Jones, Jonathan Josephs & Faisal Islam', 'BBC News']",Tech,Tech

The recipe box firm was told to pay £140,000 following a 2022 investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). It found 79 million emails and one million texts were sent out over a seven-month spamming campaign. The ICO said it marked a ""clear breach of trust"". HelloFresh said it had made changes to its SMS and email policy. Investigations began in March 2022 after 14 complaints were made directly to the regulator, and another 8,729 were made to the 7726 spam message reporting service. The ICO found HelloFresh continued to contact some individuals even after they had asked it to stop. It also found customers were not given enough information that their data would be used for marketing for up to 24 months after cancelling their subscriptions. ""This marked a clear breach of trust of the public by HelloFresh,"" said Andy Curry, head of investigations at the ICO. ""Customers weren't told exactly what they'd be opting into, nor was it clear how to opt out. From there, they were hit with a barrage of marketing texts they didn't want or expect, and in some cases, even when they told HelloFresh to stop, the deluge continued."" The ICO said the fine showed ""clear and decisive"" action would be taken if the law was not followed to protect the right of customers to choose how their data is used. HelloFresh said its customers were ""at the centre of everything we do"" and that the company took its data protection obligations extremely seriously. In contrast to the 14 complaints that the ICO said it received directly, HelloFresh claimed the regulator received just three. ""We have worked closely with the ICO,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We have carefully considered their feedback and have made changes to our SMS and email policy,"" HelloFresh was founded in 2011. Members choose meals from a changing online menu and receive recipes and fresh ingredients in a box once a week ready for cooking. Subscribers are often attracted by deals with up to 60% off their first box.

""It's a highly competitive business,"" Ms Wickham said. ""Overhead costs, with labour, electricity and fuel to deliver, are high. But [profit] margins in horticulture and wholesale are quite low. It's cut-throat."" The former supermarket director said the ICO investigation would damage HelloFresh. ""Any fine will hurt them,"" she said. ""It will affect their brand and their bottom line.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67947335,Arctic blast: Record-breaking cold weather forecast for many states,A massive winter storm has begun rolling across the US and is predicted to bring dangerously cold temperatures and severe weather through the weekend.,2024-01-12,"A massive winter storm has begun rolling across the US and is predicted to bring dangerously cold temperatures and severe weather through the weekend. From blizzards and ""large hail"" to thunderstorms and tornadoes, the National Weather Service has issued weather alerts in nearly every state. Wind chills up to -45F (-42C) are forecast in Iowa, where voters are preparing to participate in the state's caucuses on Monday. It is the week's third major US storm. Going into the three-day weekend, thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled and people began experiencing power outages on Friday. New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in advance of a storm in the western part of the state, activating the National Guard. A wind advisory warned of gusts up to 50mph (80km/h) from Texas to New York. Texas braced for lower temperatures and more frost than it saw last winter, evoking memories of the Great Texas Freeze of 2021. In parts of Texas, the NWS issued a wind chill watch through Saturday, and warned of hypothermia and frostbite. It predicted wind chills there could drop to -25F (-32C). The average low temperature in Texas was forecast at 15F (-9C), prompting some concern among state energy suppliers, which saw the power grid collapse in 2021. Texas Gov Greg Abbott told residents at a press briefing on Friday to be ""very, very cautious"" and to expect ""ultra-cold temperatures"", adding that warming centres will be available for those in need. He said another days-long blackout was unlikely. ""The power is going to stay on throughout the entirety of this winter storm episode,"" Gov Abbott said, telling Texans that there were backup generators and enough fuel for those generators to avoid a 2021 repeat. Still, there were more than 3,000 power outages in Houston on Friday afternoon, according to CenterPoint Energy, a local distributor. To the east, in Alabama, more than 11,000 customers lost power, according to a local meteorologist, who said the weather there was less severe than anticipated. In the area where Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana meet, the NWS said there was a risk of ""damaging winds, large hail, and possibly a strong tornado"". Further north, record cold temperatures brought by frigid wind chills were predicted, with over a foot of snow forecasted in some places like upper Michigan. Up to 8in (20cm) of snow was forecasted in Chicago, Illinois. Over 80,000 Illinois residents were without power as of Friday morning, according to poweroutage.us, as flight cancellations and delays in the region have swelled. Chicago Mayor Donna Johnson told the Weather Channel that she was among those to lose power. The state's governor, JB Pritzker, wrote to Texas Governor Abbott, requesting an immediate pause in sending migrants to the state by plane and bus. He said in a letter that the weather could threaten the lives of families and children. The mix of cold, snow and high winds is expected to bring blizzard conditions to other nearby states. Winter storm warnings were issued in Iowa, where Republican voters are supposed to gather on Monday to select their state's presidential nominee, as well as Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. In northern Missouri, wind chills up to 35 degrees below zero were predicted, along with 2-4in of snow, and wind gusts up to 45mph.  Those cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes, the NWS warned. ""We call it 'life-threatening' for a reason,"" a local Missouri branch of the service wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""Take it seriously. This kind of cold does not happen very often."" Wind chill warnings ranging from -55F (-48C) to -35F (-37C) have been issued across the northwest, from Washington to North Dakota, and down to Nebraska and Kansas. In Hawaii, wind advisories have also been issued warning locals of wind gusts over 75mph. However, rapid bursts of wind have already began plaguing some parts of the US. Over 4,000 miles away, in Fort Myers, Florida, local news footage showed residents battling wind gusts up to 30mph. And storm surges in the area were predicted to be up to 18ft high. The storm has also been disruptive in Iowa, a state hit by snow and frosty temperatures earlier this week. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Friday cancelled her in-person events scheduled in the state due to ""potentially dangerous weather conditions"". Ron DeSantis also cancelled two in-person events ""due to unsafe weather"", his campaign said, though Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump are still scheduled to press on ahead of Monday's caucuses in the Hawkeye State. Iowa's transportation department urged drivers to stay off the roads, warning of ""treacherous driving conditions"" across most of the state, with some routes impassable and drivers possibly encountering ""whiteout conditions, drifting snow, and slick roads"". Canadian officials issued weather warnings on Friday to every province and territory in the country. Residents in Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes were told to brace for up to one foot of snow and extreme cold temperatures. Wind chills in parts of Ontario and Quebec were forecasted to reach -30C (-22F) to -38C (-36F), bone chilling temperatures only half as cold as the -67F predicted for parts of Alberta.","['United States', 'Severe weather']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1EF9/production/_132292970_d611a431b0e721643351b6b0f0f4e9eb54c7f8440_0_5394_30341000x563.jpg'],"['By Brandon Drenon', 'BBC News, Washington']",Science,Science
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67950749,Huge ring of galaxies challenges thinking on cosmos,"Scientists at the University of Central Lancashire have discovered a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space.",2024-01-12,"Scientists at the University of Central Lancashire have discovered a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space. It is 1.3bn light-years in diameter and appears to be roughly 15 times the size of the Moon in the night sky as seen from Earth. Named the Big Ring by the astronomers, it is made up of galaxies and galaxy clusters. They say that it is so big it challenges our understanding of the universe. It cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is really distant and identifying all the galaxies that make up the bigger structure has taken a lot of time and computing power. Such large structures should not exist according to one of the guiding principles of astronomy, called the cosmological principle. This states that all matter is spread smoothly across the Universe. Although stars, planets and galaxies are huge clumps of matter in our eyes, in the context of the size of the universe they are insignificant - and the theory is that much bigger patches of matter should not form. The Big Ring is by no means the first likely violation of the cosmological principle and so suggests that there is another, yet to be discovered, factor at play. According to Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society, the evidence for a rethink of what has been a central plank of astronomy is growing. ""This is the seventh large structure discovered in the universe that contradicts the idea that the cosmos is smooth on the largest scales. If these structures are real, then it's definitely food for thought for cosmologists and the accepted thinking on how the universe has evolved over time,"" he said. The Big Ring was identified by Alexia Lopez, a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), who also discovered the Giant Arc - a structure spanning 3.3bn light-years of space. Asked how it felt to have made the discoveries, she said: ""It's really surreal. I do have to pinch myself, because I made these discoveries accidentally, they were serendipitous discoveries. But it is a big thing and I can't believe that I'm talking about it, I don't believe that it's me ""Neither of these two ultra-large structures is easy to explain in our current understanding of the universe,"" she said. ""And their ultra-large sizes, distinctive shapes, and cosmological proximity must surely be telling us something important - but what exactly?"" The giant arcs that may dwarf everything Both the Big Ring and the Giant Arc appear relatively close together, near the constellation of Bootes the Herdsman. Professor Don Pollacco, of the department of physics at the University of Warwick, said the likelihood of this occurring is vanishingly small so the two objects might be related and form an even larger structure. ""So the question is how do you make such large structures? ""It's incredibly hard to conceive of any mechanism that could produce these structures so instead the authors speculate that we are seeing a relic from the early universe where waves of high and low density material are 'frozen' in to extragalactic medium."" There are also similarly large structures discovered by other cosmologists - such as the Sloan Great Wall, which is around 1.5 billion light-years in length, and the South Pole Wall, which stretches 1.4 billion light-years across. But the biggest single entity scientists have identified is a supercluster of galaxies called the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is about 10 billion light-years wide. While the Big Ring appears as an almost perfect ring on the sky, analysis by Ms Lopez suggests it has more of a coil shape - like a corkscrew - with its face aligned with Earth. ""The Big Ring and the Giant Arc, both individually and together, gives us a big cosmological mystery as we work to understand the universe and its development.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67937253,"Public rights of way blocked in 32,000 places","Walkers wanting to enjoy footpaths across the British countryside are being blocked or obstructed in nearly 32,000 places across England and Wales.",2024-01-12,"Walkers wanting to enjoy footpaths across the British countryside are being blocked or obstructed in nearly 32,000 places across England and Wales. But they are fighting back, with one rambler even training as a lawyer to force councils to keep the way clear. A BBC investigation found councils which have responsibility for footpaths had 4,000 more access issues on public rights of way in 2023 than in 2022. Campaigners said this showed a ""growing abuse and neglect"" of the path network. Local authorities said ""funding constraints"" limited what they can do. In Cornwall, which has 2,796 miles (4,500km) of public rights of way, Lucy Wilson is one walker determined to make sure countryside footpaths are kept useable. Standing on a footpath tucked into the folds of the Tamar Valley, Mrs Wilson points up at a sheer muddy bank, topped with a thicket of brambles. ""That's where the path should go,"" she says. ""You can't see anything. It's just gone."" Her finger traces the registered right of way on a map on her phone. We scramble up the bank but have no chance of forcing our way past the thorns. She explains that people have been trying for five years to get Cornwall Council to make this path accessible. ""The council doesn't have the resources - but that's not an excuse, because they have a statutory duty to do this. It's not a choice,"" she explains. All landowners have a duty to keep paths clear but the ultimate responsibility rests with the local highways authority - usually the local county or unitary council or national park authority. Mrs Wilson, a campaigner with the Open Spaces Society, estimates that half of the Cornish footpath network has unresolved issues. She began her fight to get paths cleared in 2015 and is now training as a lawyer to try to force the council to act. ""I was trying to enjoy the countryside, and I found on quite a few occasions, I couldn't because there were gates locked, they were overgrown, impossible to get through. ""I thought rather naively, that just reporting the obstructions to the council, the council would come along and clear them. And it didn't happen. And so here I am in 2023, some of those same paths remain obstructed,"" she said. Cornwall Council told the BBC that it was ""committed to protecting the public rights of way across Cornwall"". ""Each case is determined on its own merits and we will consider the best course of action to ensure any obstructions are removed. ""The council has a finite resource and must prioritise workload accordingly,"" a spokesperson explained. Meanwhile, across England and Wales, The Ramblers - Britain's walking charity - say they are coming across similar problems - but the true scale of blocked and obstructed footpaths has so far remained unknown. So the BBC used Environmental Information Regulations to ask 118 local councils outside of London and national park authorities how many blockages and obstructions were recorded at the end of 2022 and on a specific day - 31 October 2023. Seventy-three authorities were able to provide the data, with 31,816 obstructions - ranging from overgrown vegetation to deliberately fenced-off paths - recorded on 31 October, an increase from 27,696 at the end of 2022. Kate Ashbrook, general secretary of the Open Spaces Society, said the results of the BBC's investigation showed ""a shocking and growing abuse and neglect of our public path network"". She added that local authorities were ""failing to carry out their legal duties to assert and protect the public's rights to enjoy these public highways"". Jack Cornish, head of paths for The Ramblers, said obstructions and blockages were a common issue ""but we are shocked to learn quite how many of these issues on paths remain unresolved"". ""In fact, we suspect there are vastly more blockages and obstructions than the figures show, because our own research shows that the public don't know how, or where, to report issues they experience on paths,"" he added. The councils themselves say ""funding constraints"" limit the amount of footpath maintenance they can do. ""Long-term, consistent funding would help councils plan ahead for maintenance and to reduce obstructions on rights of way,"" said Darren Rodwell, transport spokesperson for the Local Government Association. The UK government said English councils' funding settlement for 2024/25 is more than £64bn and they were ""best placed to decide how this funding is spent, including on maintaining the public paths network"". But the government is also working with landowners themselves - last week it announced new funding incentives would be on offer to farmers next year to create, maintain and upgrade footpaths. Environment secretary Steve Barclay told the BBC: ""The best way of unblocking issues is to get the landowners on board to work in partnership which in turn is great for the public but is good as a whole in terms of the country's health and wider wellbeing."" In Wales, the government said it was funding a three-year £5.6m grant to help councils and national park authorities improve and maintain public rights of way. One of those councils is Monmouthshire County Council, which is leading the way in working with landowners and walkers to protect and repair footpaths. It also works with volunteer groups of walkers to ensure problems are reported to its online mapping system as soon as possible. As a result, it received more than 15,000 reports of issues last year but says it only has 181 'live' footpath problems that it currently has to deal with on its 1,031-mile (1,659km) network We met Andrew Stumpf, a volunteer with The Ramblers Cymru, in Grosmont. He leads a group of fellow local walkers as they stomp through a boggy field, shoulders heavy with spades, and a wooden post. They are off to replace a rotten waymarker, with the landowners' permission. The kit and training is paid for by Monmouthshire County Council: the volunteers provide the labour. ""They supply us with the materials and the training expertise,"" explains Mr Stumpf. ""And they come out and help us to do the more complicated stuff. It means from their perspective that it's being done to the right standard. ""It works for us, because we're doing healthy activity, and we're getting more paths that we can actually enjoy.""",['Rural life'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/136A7/production/_132272597_lucy1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/77A3/production/_132272603_sign.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/40F3/production/_132272661_andy.jpg']","['By Malcolm Prior and Claire Marshall', 'BBC News rural affairs team']",Science,Science

Yampil, a 12-year-old Asiatic black bear, was one of the few animals to survive the attack in the Donetsk region. Named after the village where he was found, rescuers initially moved him to an animal sanctuary in Belgium. He has now been permanently rehomed to the Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian. Zoo staff told BBC Scotland News that the bear seemed ""relaxed"" despite the 690-mile trip, and was already enjoying snacking on his favourite food of cucumbers soon after arrival. However he will be closely watched to see if he exhibits any issues similar to post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) after being in a warzone. Yampil was concussed by shellfire when he was discovered in eastern Ukraine in October 2022. Most of the other 200 animals at the zoo had been killed during fierce fighting in the area. He was taken through Poland to the Natuurhulpcentrum animal sanctuary in Belgium, but now has a permanent home in West Calder. Zoo staff are now optimistic the animal will be on the road to recovery, after what they described as a ""fairly complicated"" journey to Scotland, which saw him travel overnight from Dover. Adam Welsh, the zoo's head of education, told the BBC: ""Yampil has been through a lot. He could have arrived and been incredibly nervous about meeting people. We wanted to make sure we were very delicate when he arrived, so there was no loud noises. He's experienced some really horrible things. ""Time will tell, but he seems remarkably calm, remarkably chilled out and he's been eating already. He's come out his crate, he's been eating, drinking and relaxing - that's nice to see and we're really hoping that continues."" Mr Welsh added that he was relieved that bringing Yampil north of the border had progressed smoothly. Brian Curran, owner of Five Sisters Zoo, previously stated that zoo staff's ""hearts broke"" when they first saw the bear, which was concussed after a shell had landed near him. Yampil will stay in a temporary enclosure while staff watch to see if he enters torpor - a state similar to hibernation over the winter. The zoo has been fundraising to cover the £200,000 cost of a new enclosure for Yampil, and have raised around £60,000 of their target so far. The Asiatic black bear - also known as moon bears because of crescent-shaped yellow fur on their chests -  are classed as a vulnerable species by conservation groups, with estimates suggesting there are fewer than 60,000 of them left in the world.","['West Calder', 'Animals', 'Bears', 'War in Ukraine']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/621F/production/_132291152_bear2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B962/production/_132285474_bear.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EA0/production/_132282102_yampilrescue.jpg']",,Science,Science

Brazil's environment ministry said it was the lowest recorded deforestation rate in the last five years. Though smaller than in previous years, the deforested area is still more than six times the size of New York City. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva pledged to end deforestation by 2030 when he took office a year ago. Preliminary data from national space agency Inpe showed 5,153 sq km (1,989.6 sq miles) of the Amazon were cleared in 2023, down from 10,278 sq km in 2022. President Lula promised to restore the Amazon rainforest and chase down climate criminals during his speech at climate summit COP27 in 2022. Rainforest destruction had surged to a 12-year high under his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), Brazil's environment ministry said this was the first step in achieving its zero deforestation goal. It also stated that the government remained committed to combating illegal practices in the Amazon. Growing inspection efforts by environment watchdog Ibama were key in bringing about the fall, the environment ministry added. Brazilian Environment Minister Marina Silva said the falling rate was a ""reflection"" of Ibama's ongoing work in the rainforest. The Amazon is a crucial battleground in the global fight against climate change. It is often called ""the lungs of the planet"" due to its essential role in the planet's oxygen and carbon dioxide cycles. The rainforest is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. Around 60% of it is located in Brazil.","['Brazil', 'Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest', 'Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/178A3/production/_132291469_b5e23028a943f114fe3d2b9c90a7f174f14cff7e.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12A83/production/_132291467_ac84bbee7a6bcd7f25b58f3677460dc9d2455d4b.jpg']","['By Sofia Ferreira Santos', 'BBC News']",Science,Science

Carol Gravenor, 67, from Coed Main, Caerphilly, admitted six animal welfare offences after 26 birds were rescued from her sanctuary. A peregrine falcon with a missing eye was found in a filthy cage too small to spread its wings, the RSPCA said. It had to be put down along with 20 others. Warning: This story contains images of animal cruelty The Caerphilly Bird Rescue, a well-known charity for bird rehabilitation in south Wales, was run by Mrs Gravenor and her husband Ray until his death in 2021. In a written statement heard by Newport Magistrates' Court, RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben described unhygienic and hazardous conditions found during an inspection of the centre in April 2023 The wild birds found included pigeons, blackbirds, crows, jackdaws, a peregrine falcon and a common buzzard. Some were living in a kitchen inside the property, he said, while others were loose in the garden and some were caged in sheds, and 20 were found dead. ""There were many empty soiled bird cages piled on top of each other in the garden,"" he said. ""In the back garden were several pigeons walking around that looked to have dropped wings along with some domestic ducks, a domestic goose and a chicken that was obviously lame. ""We were invited into the house and on the kitchen table were two fledgling blackbirds and a nestling pigeon."" A cardboard box on a kitchen unit also held Jackdaw with an injured eye. Mr Hogben said he found ""a peregrine falcon bird with its left eye missing"" in a shed. ""The environment was poor with no water and a filthy cage which was too small for the falcon to spread its wings in all directions. ""Within two feet [0.6m] of this cage containing the peregrine falcon was another cage containing eight pigeons. ""This cage was in full sight of the cage containing the peregrine falcon, and again had no water and the cage was in a filthy condition with hardly any perches."" All the birds were sent for assessment by a wildlife veterinarian at the RSPCA West Hatch Wildlife Centre, where just five pigeons were deemed fit to be given the chance of rehabilitation. Gravenor was sentenced to 14 weeks custody, suspended for 12 months. In her defence, her solicitor said her breathing was impacted by respiratory condition psittacosis, known as pigeon fanciers lung, and had struggled since the death of her husband. After sentencing Mr Hogben said: ""Keeping and rehabilitating wild birds is a huge commitment requiring specialist knowledge, husbandry, equipment and accommodation. ""While most rescues and sanctuary owners start out with the best intentions, sadly, vulnerable animals entering these establishments can sometimes end up in even worse situations than they were in already, with sanctuary owners ending up in situations not realising the severity of the problems with their establishments until it is too late.""","['RSPCA', 'Animal welfare', 'Pigeons', 'Wales', 'Birds']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C844/production/_132286215_untitled-138.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4DA6/production/_132287891_untitled-139.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E9E6/production/_132287895_untitled-141.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13806/production/_132287897_untitled-140.jpg']","['By Paul Pigott', 'BBC News']",Science,Science

The overflowing River Congo, passing through much of the country, has also swamped places outside the capital. The vast, vital waterway has reached its highest level in six decades. More than 300 people have died in floods over the past months, officials say. On Thursday, residents in the impoverished megacity of Kinshasa told the BBC how ""schools, hospitals and churches"" have been washed away. ""I had lived here with my relatives... I have lost everything,"" Jonas Mungindami said. Similarly, Denise Tuzola said her house is now ""full of water"". ""There is no church here any more and there is no way for the children to go to school,"" she added. Kinshasa is home to several small rivers and streams, which often double as open sewers. Many have now overflown. On one flooded street, a man waded through through thigh-level water, hauling a canoe full of passengers behind him. Trucks drove cautiously through the same waters, while dozens of discarded bottles bob on the surface. The RVF, the agency overseeing DR Congo's waterways, sounded the alarm in late December. It warned that heavy rains would cause ""exceptional flooding"" around the Kinshasa area. By this point, provinces such as Mongala and Ituri had already faced serious flooding. In Kinshasa, flooding is common but this year the River Congo has risen just shy of 6.26 metres, the level reached during record flooding in 1961. Further upstream, in the city of Kisangani, the mayor said that over 200 houses have been submerged. The Congo River has also caused turmoil in Congo-Brazzaville, a nation that borders DR Congo. Flooding there has impacted more than 336,000 people and 34 health facilities, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Just over a year ago, floods in Kinshasa left more than 120 people dead.","['Environment', 'Democratic Republic of Congo']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3320/production/_132288031_gettyimages-1915748071.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11998/production/_132288027_congoflood.png']","['By Wedaeli Chibelushi & Chinois Mbelechi Msoshi', 'BBC News, London and Kinshasa']",Science,Science

The proposed site would generate enough power for 45,000 homes and save more than three million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to developers. But those opposed say the levels should be protected from development as a site of special scientific interest (SSI). More than 2,000 people have signed a petition calling for more protection. The petition launched by the Gwent Wildlife Trust has called for a ""halt to significant development on the levels until full, formal protection for the landscape has been agreed"". The charity has already halted a scheme to build the M4 relief road through the area, an area of wetland between east Cardiff and Chepstow, Monmouthshire. The developer of the proposed solar farm - between the M4 and Llanwern Steelworks near Newport and called Craig y Perthi - said the opportunities for wildlife were ""enormous"". But campaigners said they were concerned about the site, 20% of which would be in a site of an SSSI and surround the community from three sides. Adam Taylor, chief executive of the Gwent Wildlife Trust, said: ""The Gwent Levels are one of the most threatened SSSIs in Wales. ""SSIs only cover 8% of the area of the whole of Wales, and we think these sites should be sacrosanct and shouldn't be subject to development. Ninety-two percent of Wales is available for solar and other sustainable developments and we would recommend that these developments take place there instead"". Campaigners say planning laws need to be amended to protect the long-term future of the Gwent Levels. Mike Webb, from the Gwent Wildlife Trust, said: ""It's been here for thousands of years. It's the result of the interaction of humans with nature. ""We're not calling for a moratorium on every single, small for example domestic planning application. It's a moratorium on major developments on the levels."" Diana Callaghan, who has lived in the area for 25 years, said: ""It's a wonderful place to be, but as a resident I fear this area is really under threat. ""We can't keep covering our landscape with plastic and glass and buildings and cement, because the planet needs green space to survive as well"". Robin Johnson of JMB Solar, part of power generating company RWE, and project manager for the site, said he recognised how important it was to look after the wildlife benefits of the solar farm. He said: ""The opportunities for wildlife here are enormous. ""With a solar farm you are only penetrating about 1% of the ground because panels sit above ground, and underneath the panels you have a diverse grassland which encourages the local wildlife, especially reptiles and birds that can thrive on a solar site as opposed to an intensively managed agricultural site."" About 5,000 people have signed the petition so far, which needs 10,000 signatures by late January to be debated in the Senedd. The Welsh government said: ""We are working on strategic planning guidance to protect the Gwent Levels from unacceptable biodiversity and landscape impacts.

The 2m-long pliosaur fossil featured in a BBC film with Sir David Attenborough. As of 11 January, the Etches Collection in Kimmeridge said it had received 4,868 visitors, almost 10 times their usual number for the whole of January. The museum's manager said the numbers far exceed those who came when they first opened in 2016 and might not have hit their peak. The 150-million-year-old marine reptile went on display last week, close to where the beast was found on a beach near Kimmeridge Bay. The rest of its skeleton may still be entombed in the crumbling cliffs, and the hope is it may eventually be recovered. The museum's operations manager Carla Crook, daughter of palaeontologist Steve Etches who led the excavation, said their total number of visitors for the whole month of January is ""usually only about 500"". Its busiest day ever, on Saturday 6 January, saw a total number of 1,064 visitors. ""The majority are local, but there are lots of people who are coming from much further afield,"" Mrs Crook said. ""We've had people come down from Wales... We have had some people visit from Australia. ""These are people that have come over from abroad and because they've heard about the skull they've tied us into their visit."" She said the museum has had enquiries from people in the United States, Australia, and Europe, and that they do not think interest in the skull has hit its ""potential peak yet"". ""[The documentary] is still to go out on PBS on the 14 February to the United States, so we're still awaiting the wash of potential interest of visitors that that screening is going to create,"" she said. ""It's given us that lifeline in visitors that we so desperately need to keep us going. ""I think Kimmeridge will become busier because they'll want to come down and actually, not just take in the geology of the bay, but try to look for fossils themselves."" But if people wish to fossil-hunt, Mrs Crook said it was really important they follow the fossil collecting code, the rules and regulations of the bay, and health and safety precautions. She said: ""Loose fossils along the whole of the Jurassic coast are okay to pick up, but Steve is the only one that has access to actually collect from Kimmeridge bay. ""What they can't do is use hammers to hammer anything out of the shell ledges or the cliffs.""

Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council wants to lower speed limits to cut pollution and improve road safety. Deputy leader Millie Earl said the parties that make up the ruling Three Towns Alliance had campaigned on the 20mph issue ahead of the last election. The Conservative group described the plans as ""anti-car measures"". Responding to a question from cycling campaigner Adam Osman at Tuesday's council meeting, Ms Earl said a default 20mph limit in urban areas ""would be beneficial to walking, wheeling and cycling"" as well as benefiting public health and air quality. She said her ward of Newtown and Heatherlands in Poole had already seen the benefits of 20mph zones. ""I would like to see other communities able to benefit from the safer and healthier environment as we have,"" she said. ""There will be some roads that are exempt on the basis of need and capacity, and it is also likely the roll-out will take some time."" Ms Earl said the council was working with Dorset Police on the plan and was keen to hear the views of the community. She added: ""We have a meeting later this week with the 20's Plenty for Us organisation so we can learn from their experience in other places that have implemented change."" Cabinet is due to discuss the plans in April, after which a public consultation will be held on any proposed changes. Conservative group leader Philip Broadhead described the proposals as ""quite from the blue"" and ""extremely worrying"". He said: ""Many of us warned that voting for these parties would see a return to anti-car measures, and this announcement... shows that we were right."" Mr Osman said reducing the limit was the most ""cost efficient"" way to cut road deaths, reduce car journeys, encourage cycling and improve air quality. In September, Wales became the first UK nation to lower speed limits in residential areas from 30mph (48km/h) to 20mph.

Ellie Richardson, owner of the Haw Bridge Inn, in Tirley, near Tewkesbury, said the pub was submerged in 2ft [0.6m] of dirty water. She believes higher flood gates and dredging the River Severn could help reduce the risk of flooding. The EA said: ""It's not possible to stop all communities from flooding"". Despite urging the Environment Agency to install higher flood gates and repair their defective pumps, Ms Richardson was told it was ""not viable"". She had installed eight metal pumps of her own in anticipation of heavy rainfall, but said it was still not enough. ""We are the forgotten hamlet,"" Ms Richardson said. ""Because they can't get to us when the flood water is high, they think we don't need them- but that's rubbish."" Ms Richardson had previously asked the EA for three flood defence panels to be installed on the doors, but they only provided two. They also provided five plastic pumps, which were ineffective against the volume of water. ""Suddenly the water came over the flood gates and I couldn't hold it back, even with eight pumps working,"" she said. ""I blame the Environmental Agency for the losses I've incurred, not because it's flooded, but because of the inadequacy of the gates. ""I'm coping, other people aren't. They are mentally and physically affected and their homes are being destroyed.""

Mark Infield, Ashdown Forest's landscape recovery manager, said: ""Together with our neighbours including local farmers, landowners, Sussex Wildlife Trust, The Woodland Trust, East Sussex County Council and Southern Water - we want to create a landscape that is bigger, better, and joined up."" He said plans included creating and connecting more thickets and hedgerows, as well as improving areas of woodland, meadows and streams to ""enable nature to thrive"". Winne the Pooh creator A.A. Milne lived in Ashdown Forest in the 1920s, with the heathland said to be the inspiration for the bear's fictional home. The area was once home to pine martens, beavers, turtle doves, red backed shrikes and nightingales. The project is designed to promote sustainable farming whilst providing a boost to nature recovery. Local farmer Nick Attwell, from Nutley, said he joined the scheme because he wants his granddaughter to ""experience the joy of nightingales and skylarks, and all these other wonderful creatures"". He said: ""I want to be able to play my part in encouraging nature back, to allow her to live in the same sort of world with all the species that perhaps we took for granted, when we were young."" Mr Infield said: ""Working with our like-minded partners we want to make a positive impact on the landscape which will reverse practices that have had a negative effect on nature. ""It will take years but once nature is allowed to get back to work, positive changes will follow."" Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

The technique measures the amount of chromosomes in ancient human cells ""more precisely"", said researchers. They have also identified the first prehistoric person with mosaic Turner syndrome, from about 2,500 years ago. The research was carried out by the University of York, the Francis Crick Institute, the University of Oxford and Oxford Archaeology. Down's syndrome, mosaic Turner syndrome and other conditions the researchers identified all stem from chromosomal abnormalities. Most cells in the human body have 23 pairs of chromosomes and the conditions occur when a person's cells have an extra or missing chromosome. Professor Ian Armit, from the University of York's Department of Archaeology, said: ""Ancient DNA samples decay over time and can often become contaminated. ""A new technique was needed to help researchers overcome these challenges so that we could see just how far back we can trace these conditions, and we now know that they have been part of human history for a considerable period of time - more than 2,000 years in some cases."" The individuals tested with the new technology lived across a range of time periods, from the Iron Age 2,500 years ago up to the Post-Medieval period, about 250 years ago. Klinefelter, Jacob's and mosaic Turner syndromes all involve abnormalities with sex chromosomes and the researchers found that the individuals with these conditions had delayed puberty. All were buried according to their society's customs although no possessions were found with them, the experts said. Pontus Skoglund, group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Crick, said: ""Our method is able to classify DNA contamination in many cases, and can help to analyse incomplete ancient DNA, so it could be applied to archaeological remains which have been difficult to analyse. ""Combining this data with burial context and possessions can allow for a historical perspective of how sex, gender and diversity were perceived in past societies.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67950749,Huge ring of galaxies challenges thinking on cosmos,"Scientists at the University of Central Lancashire have discovered a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space.",2024-01-12,"Scientists at the University of Central Lancashire have discovered a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space. It is 1.3bn light-years in diameter and appears to be roughly 15 times the size of the Moon in the night sky as seen from Earth. Named the Big Ring by the astronomers, it is made up of galaxies and galaxy clusters. They say that it is so big it challenges our understanding of the universe. It cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is really distant and identifying all the galaxies that make up the bigger structure has taken a lot of time and computing power. Such large structures should not exist according to one of the guiding principles of astronomy, called the cosmological principle. This states that all matter is spread smoothly across the Universe. Although stars, planets and galaxies are huge clumps of matter in our eyes, in the context of the size of the universe they are insignificant - and the theory is that much bigger patches of matter should not form. The Big Ring is by no means the first likely violation of the cosmological principle and so suggests that there is another, yet to be discovered, factor at play. According to Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society, the evidence for a rethink of what has been a central plank of astronomy is growing. ""This is the seventh large structure discovered in the universe that contradicts the idea that the cosmos is smooth on the largest scales. If these structures are real, then it's definitely food for thought for cosmologists and the accepted thinking on how the universe has evolved over time,"" he said. The Big Ring was identified by Alexia Lopez, a PhD student at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), who also discovered the Giant Arc - a structure spanning 3.3bn light-years of space. Asked how it felt to have made the discoveries, she said: ""It's really surreal. I do have to pinch myself, because I made these discoveries accidentally, they were serendipitous discoveries. But it is a big thing and I can't believe that I'm talking about it, I don't believe that it's me ""Neither of these two ultra-large structures is easy to explain in our current understanding of the universe,"" she said. ""And their ultra-large sizes, distinctive shapes, and cosmological proximity must surely be telling us something important - but what exactly?"" The giant arcs that may dwarf everything Both the Big Ring and the Giant Arc appear relatively close together, near the constellation of Bootes the Herdsman. Professor Don Pollacco, of the department of physics at the University of Warwick, said the likelihood of this occurring is vanishingly small so the two objects might be related and form an even larger structure. ""So the question is how do you make such large structures? ""It's incredibly hard to conceive of any mechanism that could produce these structures so instead the authors speculate that we are seeing a relic from the early universe where waves of high and low density material are 'frozen' in to extragalactic medium."" There are also similarly large structures discovered by other cosmologists - such as the Sloan Great Wall, which is around 1.5 billion light-years in length, and the South Pole Wall, which stretches 1.4 billion light-years across. But the biggest single entity scientists have identified is a supercluster of galaxies called the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is about 10 billion light-years wide. While the Big Ring appears as an almost perfect ring on the sky, analysis by Ms Lopez suggests it has more of a coil shape - like a corkscrew - with its face aligned with Earth. ""The Big Ring and the Giant Arc, both individually and together, gives us a big cosmological mystery as we work to understand the universe and its development."" The findings have been presented at the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in New Orleans.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27506885,Annie Nightingale obituary: Innovative DJ who always had the hottest tunes,"As the first female presenter on BBC Radio 1 and the station's longest-serving DJ, Annie Nightingale was one of the UK's most respected and influential broadcasters, with a passion for music that never dimmed.",2024-01-12,"As the first female presenter on BBC Radio 1 and the station's longest-serving DJ, Annie Nightingale was one of the UK's most respected and influential broadcasters, with a passion for music that never dimmed. She was famed for her enthusiasm for a wide spectrum of musical genres, from prog rock through punk to the dance and rap of the 21st Century. A former journalist, she also fronted The Old Grey Whistle Test for the BBC, and paved the way for the many female DJs who followed in her footsteps. Anne Avril Nightingale was born in Brentford, west London, on 1 April 1940. Her very first word was ""music"". Her father Basil had inherited a wallpaper business, but had no interest in it. Her mother Celia was frustrated by her own lack of a career. An only child, Annie became acutely aware that the marriage was unhappy. She was sent to a Catholic boarding school at the age of five, although it was not the family religion. She became fascinated by the images of the Virgin Mary on the walls, collecting copies of them as if they were pop stars. Later, Nightingale won a scholarship to the independent Lady Eleanor Holles School, but spent much of her time hanging out in coffee bars. Having exhausted the school's patience, she did a course in journalism at the Regent Street Polytechnic. ""I hated coming from the suburbs, but at least I could always get to London,"" she recalled. ""I could always get to the action."" At the age of 19, she began a relationship with a married newspaper reporter. Her parents tried to make her a ward of court, but the couple eloped to Brighton and later married. They had two children, but the relationship did not last. She got a job as the only female reporter on the Brighton Argus and began writing a music column called Spin with Me. All the big groups of the 1960s played Brighton, so Nightingale grabbed the opportunity to interview her idols. These included the Beatles, with whom she struck up a lasting friendship. She became a trusted member of the Fab Four's inner circle, always careful not to divulge too many of their secrets - she knew about John Lennon and Yoko Ono's relationship months before it was made public. Paul McCartney even proposed to her on one occasion. ""Well, sort of yes,"" she said when asked about it years later. ""But I don't think he was serious!"" Her break in radio came with the BBC, where she found herself doing features from an unmanned studio in Brighton. However, with her long blonde hair and Sixties-chick looks, it was inevitable that she would move into television. That's For Me, a short-lived pop programme on Rediffusion TV, brought Nightingale to a wider audience. It involved viewers writing in to request the appearance of a particular band, and getting to meet their heroes backstage. ""It's rather like being a fab fairy grandmother,"" she told Fabulous 208 Magazine in 1965. When the BBC launched Radio 1 in 1967, it became her ambition to join the station. But BBC managers stuck rigidly to their all-male line-up. ""They said radio DJs were 'husband substitutes',"" Nightingale recalled. ""I found that ridiculous."" Eventually the BBC relented, but she found it hard going. During her first broadcast, she hit the wrong button and the station ground to a halt. ""Nobody showed me the technical side,"" she said. ""All the men had learned on the pirate ships. It was terrifying. I had a lot to prove."" In fact, she felt that some wanted her to fail, complaining loudly in her headphones about the choice of music while she was on air. ""What the hell is it about radio that it has to be male?"" she later said. ""This was my battle."" However, she found a soulmate in John Peel, who was also famed for his refusal to adhere to BBC playlist protocol. Her knowledge and enthusiasm carried the day, but it would be another 12 years before Radio 1 employed Janice Long as a second female presenter. Nightingale started with a Sunday evening show before moving on to a late-night prog rock programme. She never wanted to be a mainstream daytime presenter and hated making the personal appearances that Radio 1 bosses encouraged. ""As a night-time DJ you aren't obliged to play the playlist,"" she said. ""You don't have to be an entertainer. You have to really know your music, but you can also experiment."" By the late 70s, she was presenting the Sunday Afternoon Request Show, which became essential listening for a generation of teenagers. Nightingale also embraced punk. ""It was very important, because by then rock music had become part of the establishment, so something had to come and blow it out of the water."" She brought her love of changing music styles to The Old Grey Whistle Test, which she began presenting in 1978. Out went the dependence on rock, blues and country that had dominated the programme during the years of ""Whispering"" Bob Harris. Nightingale ushered in punk and new wave. By the mid-90s, Nightingale was presenting The Chill Out Zone, in which she featured dance music in the small hours. She was also travelling the world making a series of music documentaries. During one of these trips, she was viciously mugged in Havana. The attack shattered her right leg and she had to be airlifted back to the UK for treatment. She also had a narrow escape after being slipped a dose of ""date-rape"" drug Rohypnol while she was working in Iraq. ""I've been mugged in Cuba, drugged in Baghdad and bugged in Russia,"" she once remarked to the Independent. With the coming of the internet, she found herself broadcasting to a worldwide audience. Nightingale's championing of the work of breakbeat artists such as the Freestylers and Meat Katie earned her the title Queen of Breaks. She was made an MBE in 2002 and was awarded a CBE in 2019, having clocked up half a century behind the turntables on Radio 1. ""It's the coolest big-up ever,"" she remarked. The fascination with new musical genres kept her broadcasting into her ninth decade. She may have been the oldest DJ on Radio 1, but she always sounded fresh. ""I'm totally committed to this,"" she said. ""It takes over your life and you can't pretend - what would be the point of that?""",,"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1211A/production/_113701047_annienightingalesinglehi017156069.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16F3A/production/_113701049_annienightingale1965gettyimages-56217785.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3AA2/production/_113701051_annienightingale1964gettyimages-3096801.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AFD2/production/_113701054_annienightingaler1gettyimages-84863064.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/34C6/production/_113701531_annienightingaleogwtgettyimages-98139040.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1695E/production/_113701529_annienightingaleguiness2010hi013415346.jpg']",,Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

The Lords' Day, which was published in 2007, is a tale about a security breach at the State Opening of Parliament. Its author, Michael Dobbs, told the BBC he was ""utterly surprised, overjoyed, very excited and rather deeply humbled"" that his thriller had been selected. He added that the move showed the Queen had ""a fantastic sense of humour"". In the book, the late Queen Elizabeth and the then-Prince Charles are among those held captive during a siege of the House of Lords. It was ""controversial"" when it first came out, Dobbs said, because it talked about possible security flaws in Parliament. But he said people eventually understood that he was not ""writing a manual for terrorists"". ""I was writing a novel which gave solutions on security, and it helped toughen up that security,"" he added. Dobbs, himself a member of the House of Lords, has also written other books including the original House of Cards. He sent a copy of The Lords' Day to the new King and Queen about a year ago ""for a chuckle"". ""I didn't expect them to read it, they are busy people,"" he added. He learned about the inclusion of his book on The Queen's Reading Room book list, as first reported by The Telegraph, about three weeks ago from his publisher. ""I was bowled over when I found out,"" he said. ""If you look at her previous choices, you have the likes of Dickens, Tolstoy, and some of the greatest modern authors on the list, and to have a Dobbs novel included was totally unexpected. ""The Queen is very serious about getting people to read, and opening up people's minds, which is what books do best,"" he added. The King carried out the State Opening of Parliament for the first time as monarch last November, accompanied by the Queen. The ceremony, dating back to the 15th Century, marks the start of a parliamentary session, bringing together the constituent parts of Parliament - the Crown, peers and MPs. The Queen's Reading Room launched as an online book club on Instagram, before becoming a charity last February. It includes a list of reading recommendations from the Queen herself. Other books on the list include Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo, and The Year of Eating Dangerously, by the Queen's son Tom Parker Bowles. The organisation also hosts an annual literary festival and has launched a new podcast.

The network has said the ploy was ""a misguided attempt"" to recognise on-air talent that were not eligible for certain categories. The awards won were reportedly re-engraved with the real names of the on-air personalities. The sports network has apologised. Details of the ploy were first uncovered in a report on Thursday by sports publication The Athletic. The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS), the organisation behind the Emmys, told The Athletic that it had ""identified a number of fictitious credits submitted by ESPN to multiple Sports Emmys competitions"". NATAS then notified ESPN's senior management of this finding, who has since apologised and reprimanded those who were responsible. The Athletic's report centred around ESPN's ""College GameDay"" programme, which nabbed eight Emmys for Outstanding Weekly Studio Show between 2008 and 2018. Until 2023, that category prohibited submissions from on-air talent in an effort to avoid duplicate wins for a single programme. On-air personalities could instead submit for other categories, like Outstanding Host or Emerging On-Air Talent. In a bid to secure awards for their on-air talent, the network reportedly circumvented eligibility rules by submitting entries with fake names credited for the programme. The fake names were similar to those of the on-air personalities, with the same initials but slightly altered. There is no evidence suggesting the on-air personalities were aware of the submissions or the ploy. In a statement to the BBC, ESPN spokesperson Julie McKay said the ploy involved award submissions that may date back as far back as 1997. ""This was a misguided attempt to recognize on-air individuals who were important members of our production team, "" Ms McKay said in an email.  ""Once current leadership was made aware, we apologized to [The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences] for violating guidelines."" Ms McKay said the network has brought in outside counsel to conduct ""a full and thorough investigation."" She added those who were responsible were disciplined by ESPN. Along with being forced to return the statuettes, NATAS said it has also imposed a one-year disqualification from award eligibility for the senior leadership of ""College GameDay"".","['United States', 'Emmy Awards']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15FB6/production/_132283009_gettyimages-1243175519.jpg'],"['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

""You know, not criticising others' choices, but for me to not take off my clothes in a movie or be vulnerable in physical ways is a choice that I guess I make for myself,"" she said. The actress, interviewed by Notting Hill writer and director Richard Curtis for British Vogue, also said she nearly didn't take the film's starring role. ""Honestly, one of the hardest things I've ever had to do was your movie, playing a movie actress,"" she told him. ""I was so uncomfortable! I mean, we've talked about this so many times, but I almost didn't take the part because it just seemed - oh, it just seemed so awkward. I didn't even know how to play that person."" The star was also asked if she chose roles that represented her views on feminism. ""It would be more to the point that the things I choose not to do are representative of me,"" she replied.

Roberts said she'd had a ""G-rated career"" - referring to the US film rating for movies suitable for a general audience. She had a body double for revealing scenes as a prostitute in 1990's Pretty Woman, and has previously spoken about asking for an explicit sex scene in 2009's Duplicity to be changed. ""It's not really what I do, so if you're going to ask me to do it, you have to expect it to be toned down. You know, as a mum of three, I feel like that,"" she was reported to have said at the time. She also once said: ""I wouldn't do nudity in films. To act with my clothes on is a performance. To act with my clothes off is a documentary."" During the new Vogue interview, Curtis said there was a ""tough side"" to Roberts. ""I think I speak very plainly,"" the Oscar winner responded. ""That's kind of how I see myself. I'm very forthright. ""There are a lot of personalities in the world that don't accept that easily, and it can seem really harsh, even if I feel like I'm just being honest about something and just saying, 'This is how I see it'. I never am trying to be unkind."" She recalled that she ""loathed"" a costume that had been chosen for her to wear in a key scene in Notting Hill, so decided to send her driver back to her flat to fetch her own clothes for her to wear instead. ""It was my own flip-flops and my cute little blue velvet skirt and a T-shirt and my cardigan."" Roberts also said young film stars have a more ""exhausting"" and ""chaotic"" time now compared with the late 1980s and early 90s, when she made her name. ""I don't know if it's better [today], because it's not my experience, but it just seems very different,"" she said. ""And in a way, it seems so cluttered. There are so many elements to being famous now, it just seems exhausting. ""Whereas I feel like, and again this is just my perception, because I don't really know - I'm not a young person starting out in show business in the 21st Century - but it seems to me that it was: you meet people, you read for parts, you try to get jobs, you get a job, you try to do a good job, and from that job, you might meet some new people who might suggest you to some other people and then you might get another job and you might get paid a little bit more for that job, and it might be a little bit of a better job.

The Golden Globe-nominated star said he felt ""fear and trepidation"" when he was asked to star in short film The After. ""I knew it would require cracking open my heart and just letting the world in somehow,"" he tells the BBC. But his fear was ""the reason I eventually felt I had to do it"", he says. The After follows Dayo, played by Oyelowo, who goes through an unexpected, catastrophic and brutal loss. In the blink of an eye, his entire life is changed forever and engulfed in grief. Oyelowo says he felt ""very safe"" in the hands of director and co-writer Misan Harriman. Harriman was the first black male photographer to shoot the cover of Vogue in its 104-year history in 2020, and was also chosen by Duke and Duchess of Sussex to photograph their daughter Lilibet for her first birthday. Having become a photographer a mere seven years ago (he used to be a City headhunter), Harriman has also taken pictures of celebrities including Rihanna, Stormzy, Olivia Colman, Princess Beatrice, Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tom Cruise. And he took one of the most arresting images of 2020's Black Lives Matters protests, of under-21 England hockey player Darcy Bourne outside the US Embassy. The photo went on to be widely shared by names including Vogue editor Edward Enninful, athlete Dina Asher-Smith, Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and activist Martin Luther King III. According to Vogue, the image led to him being asked to do the cover for its activism-themed September 2020 issue. London's newspaper The Standard called him ""the most talked about photographer of our times"" that year. Oyelowo said he was ""stopped in my tracks"" by Harriman's premise for his film. ""I had my own personal grief journey I was going through,"" he says. ""I had lost my mother in 2017 and then my dad in 2020."" Ultimately he found the role cathartic, having researched it by watching resources about grief, and seeing ""the commonality - that human existence is a shared experience"". ""The more you recognise that, and realise that beyond race, gender, culture, country - you feel connected to something,"" he adds. The actor was careful not to speak to other people about their experiences because ""it's so personal, and you never want to exacerbate someone's grief journey by it feeling like you're now using it to for an artistic endeavour that they are not necessarily connected to"". Harriman, who came up with the idea of the film, which written by John Julius Schwabach, talks about the ""mental health crisis"" after the Covid pandemic. He says he doesn't think it's over. ""I think we are still seeing the mental health repercussions of that. ""I wanted to make a film that allowed vulnerability to be seen, with no filters, so people could see pieces of their own journeys of grief and anxiety, and find pieces of themselves in that film, with a view to them having an understanding that they can build themselves back up."" He says he speaks a lot to young people who ""had so much taken away from them"", adding that ""chronic depression is of the highest it's ever been"". ""We are not OK,"" he says. ""I wanted to make a companion piece to all of that concern, to try and have people understand that it is OK not to be OK. And it's all right to sometimes to be sat on the floor and not have the answers. ""I think the stakes are that high right now."" In The After, we see Dayo trying to carry on with life through his grief, as a rideshare driver, where he is in close proximity to other people but is emotionally isolated. Oyelowo explains that ""one of the things we tried to do with the film is to show that loneliness is something that can happen when you're in a crowd"". The film is one of 15 to be shortlisted for best live action short at the Oscars, with the nominations announced on 23 January, including five contenders in that category. Oyelowo is no stranger to awards ceremonies. ""I've done this dance before... so for me, the fact that this is Misan's first film, to even be on the shortlist for the Oscars is kind of bonkers,"" he says. Harriman adds: ""I'm someone who suffers from pretty bad imposter syndrome, so this has been quite good for that."" Oyelowo starred in 2015's film Selma, about the marches led by Dr Martin Luther King as he tried to secure the right of African Americans to vote freely. That film was nominated for two Oscars, including best film, and won best original song, but was snubbed at the Baftas. Last year's Bafta film awards came under fire after all the winners at the ceremony were white, despite the fact it had a diverse set of nominees, with people belonging to ethnic minorities making up almost 40% of acting nominees. It came three years after an outcry and subsequent reforms when all 20 acting nominees were white. Does Oyelowo think Bafta has more work to do on diversity? He responds by saying simply: ""It speaks for itself."" Oyelowo says he hopes the film shows people ""the things they need to confront, or the things that they just need to accept. Ultimately where we tried to land is in a place of hope"". He adds: ""Even in my own grief journey, there is there is beauty. There is hope, there is love in many ways. ""Loss defines love and love defines loss. True loss can only exist if there was true love. And you know, I wouldn't swap having true love in my life."" The After is available to watch on Netflix.

Nightingale joined the station in 1970 and remained the only woman on the line-up for 12 years. She was known for her passion for a wide range of music, championing everything from prog rock and punk to acid house and grime. She remained on air until late last year with Annie Nightingale Presents. Nightingale was also known for co-hosting BBC Two music show The Old Grey Whistle Test. Tributes have been flooding in, with DJ Annie Mac saying Nightingale was ""a trailblazer, spirited, adventurous, fearless, hilarious, smart, and so good at her job"". Writing on Instagram, she added: ""This is the woman who changed the face and sound of British TV and radio broadcasting forever. You can't underestimate it."" BBC Radio 2 presenter Zoe Ball said she was ""heartbroken"" at the news, adding: ""She loved music like no other, she sought out the tunes and artists that shaped our lives, she interviewed them all, opening doors for musicians, DJs and broadcasters alike."" Fellow Radio 2 host Jo Whiley said Nightingale was ""the coolest woman who ever graced the airwaves"". She added: ""She blazed a trail for us all and never compromised. Her passion for music never diminished."" 6 Music DJ and Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne thanked Nightingale ""for opening the door and for showing us all what to do when we got through it"", adding: ""You will be missed so much."" The news of Nightingale's death was announced on BBC Radio 1, with presenter Mollie King saying she had ""really championed female talent"". ""I think I can say I speak for myself and other women in broadcasting when I say we owe her an immense amount of gratitude for everything she has done."" Tim Davie, director general of the BBC, called Nightingale a ""uniquely gifted broadcaster"". He continued: ""As well as being a trailblazer for new music, she was a champion for female broadcasters, supporting and encouraging other women to enter the industry. We will all miss her terribly."" A statement attributed to her family on Friday said she ""passed away yesterday at her home in London after a short illness"". ""Annie was a pioneer, trailblazer and an inspiration to many. Her impulse to share that enthusiasm with audiences remained undimmed after six decades of broadcasting on BBC TV and radio globally. ""Never underestimate the role model she became. Breaking down doors by refusing to bow down to sexual prejudice and male fear gave encouragement to generations of young women who, like Annie, only wanted to tell you about an amazing tune they had just heard. ""Watching Annie do this on television in the 1970s, most famously as a presenter on the BBC music show The Old Grey Whistle Test, or hearing her play the latest breakbeat techno on Radio One is testimony to someone who never stopped believing in the magic of rock 'n' roll."" They added that a celebration of her life would take place at a memorial service in the spring. Nightingale famously presented Radio 1's Request Show in the 1970s, 80s and 90s before moving to an overnight slot. She also hosted occasional shows on Radio 2, 5 Live and 6 Music, as well as a range of documentaries. ""Every week, in my job, is a new adventure. I enjoy it,"" she said last July. ""People don't understand. Most people get bored with pop music when they're a certain age. I go on being interested in where it's going, the twists and turns."" Radio 1's current boss Aled Haydn Jones said in a statement: ""All of us at Radio 1 are devastated to lose Annie, our thoughts are with her family and friends."" He added: ""She was the first female DJ on Radio 1 and over her 50 years on the station was a pioneer for women in the industry and in dance music. We have lost a broadcasting legend."" Radio 1 presenter Greg James wrote on X that Nightingale's life and achievements had been ""so extraordinary you couldn't possibly sum them up on here"". Glastonbury Festival co-organiser Emily Eavis said she had been ""an inspiration to so many women in music"" and a ""lovely human being"". She added: ""Goodbye dear Annie, a female trailblazer and true enthusiast."" Nightingale was last on air with a three-part ""best of 2023"" show on 19 December. After playing tracks by Dimitri Vegas, Daft Punk, Sam Smith and Bad Bunny she signed off by wishing listeners ""a brilliant Christmas"". Her final words on Radio 1 were, appropriately, ""lots of love, from me to you"".","['Radio', 'BBC', 'Music']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EA05/production/_132290995_6751dc93cf61f3bf1caa71f387ca4b2ec005f4a4.jpg'],"['By Ian Youngs & Noor Nanji', 'BBC News']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67957694,Poor Things: 'I don't mind they erased Glasgow from dad's book',The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend.,2024-01-12,"The film Poor Things has already won awards and been tipped for Oscar success despite only opening in cinemas around the UK this weekend. Based on a 1992 novel by Scots artist and writer Alasdair Gray, it's the fantastical tale of a woman who takes her own life and is revived by a Victorian surgeon who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos was blown away by the book which he first read in 2009. ""I completely fell in love with Bella Baxter - and it was obvious to me that somehow I had to bring her to life. ""I was surprised no one had made a film version."" In fact, there was a film version - written by Alasdair Gray and Sandy Johnson - just two years after the book was published. They envisaged a cast which included Robert Carlisle and Helena Bonham Carter but it was a project which didn't get off the ground. Lanthimos travelled to Glasgow in 2011 to meet Alasdair Gray, and was taken on a tour of the places mentioned in the book. A year later, Lanthimos acquired the film rights. A decade later, with a screenplay by Tony McNamara, the film began shooting on a set in Hungary, the Glasgow locations replaced with futuristic versions of Paris, Lisbon and London. It has led to a frenzied debate on social media about whether the loss of the location has lessened the film. But Alasdair Gray's son Andrew, who looks after the Gray estate, disagrees. He believes the production and its entire cast and crew treated the book with respect. ""When I met the cast, a lot of people had read the book so I was very impressed with that. ""My father didn't set any pre-conditions when he met Yorgos. The contract was drawn up, probably around 2012 and he was aware and in agreement with the circumstances of it. ""He wasn't a film director. He was happy for someone else to take on his work."" There's also more than a hint of Gray in the character of Baxter, played by Willem Dafoe. The Frankenstein patchwork of his face has echoes of Alasdair Gray's chiselled artwork and he uses the same gentle accent and singsong voice as Gray himself. ""I listened to tapes of Alasdair Gray,"" he said,"" and even though I wasn't trying to copy that accent I liked how he spoke and he had a wicked sense of humour and I think he put a lot of himself into the character of Baxter."" The film has been garnering awards since it first won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September. Last week it won two Golden Globes and is now being tipped for Bafta and Oscar success. ""It's very much like a fairy tale for me,"" says Andrew Gray, who's seen the film seven times, including a special screening at the Glasgow Film Theatre and another in his neighbourhood cinema in Connecticut where he's lived for the last 30 years. ""It's not often you get invited to red carpet events, I know the experience is temporary but it's been good fun."" Gray, who died in 2019 at the age of 85 was one of Scotland's greatest artists and writers. His first novel Lanark, published in 1981, is widely regarded as a landmark publication, responsible for a renaissance in Scottish writing. One of his artworks, in private hands since it was created in the 1950s, sold at auction last week for a record £42,700. Andrew Gray believes it's long overdue attention. ""I think Alasdair has been neglected over the years and I'm hoping this will being more international attention to his work,"" he said. ""The limelight that this film has shared onto his work is certainly going to promote his writing and his art. It's going to bring new readers back to the book."" And that's the hope they have at the National Library of Scotland which holds his literary archive. It includes handwritten notes, manuscripts, artworks and letters. There are three early versions of Poor Creatures, which would go on to become Poor Things. In the correspondence is a letter from Gray to Yorgos Lanthimos after his visit to Glasgow, wishing him the best for his film adaptation. Colin McIlroy, curator of modern literary manuscripts said: ""There are hundreds and hundreds of boxes. ""And it covers pretty much the working process for almost all of his written output: novels, short stories, dramas, radio adaptations, film scripts, diaries, and correspondence."" Some of the archive is available for consultation in the library's reading rooms but with 200 boxes, spanning a career of almost seven decades, the library is currently fundraising for a full time cataloguer. Chris Cassells, head of archives and manuscript collections at the library said: ""This is a collection of international significance - one of the biggest literary archives we have. ""We would very much hope that, given the amount of attention the film has received, given that it's really put Alasdair's name in the spotlight internationally, that people will watch the film before reading the book. ""And then they'll read other books and explore perhaps further into the hinterlands of Scottish literature.""","['Glasgow', 'Film', 'Literature']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17F1E/production/_132287089_poor2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/09E1/production/_132292520_poor.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A621/production/_132292524_961debfb11d4229fa7e8385e9fea8b0d00de70e2.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5801/production/_132292522_willem.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11B51/production/_132292527_4f766def-54a3-4e0b-8306-3d8239f52c67.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A3C9/production/_132292914_0ced4fed-a357-4985-8ab0-33d215f4f1fc.jpg']","['By Pauline McLean', 'BBC Scotland arts correspondent']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67937404,Party: The new-style nightclub that's only open in the day,"If you like a night out but are known to nod off at a bar when it gets late, the day-time nightclub may be for you.",2024-01-12,"If you like a night out but are known to nod off at a bar when it gets late, the day-time nightclub may be for you. Actress Vicky McClure and husband Jonny Owen have created a club night that's open in the day but shuts early so you can get a kebab, the last train and be home for some Saturday night telly. The idea is you'll be fresh to take the kids to their clubs the next morning. ""Instead of dancing the night away, this is dancing the afternoon away,"" joked Line of Duty star Vicky. As a nod to the Bee Gees' party classic Night Fever, the all-day discos are called Day Fever where its more ""all day long"" than ""all night long"". ""It's a nightclub in the afternoon for people of a certain age,"" said filmmaker Jonny, 52. ""I love meeting mates, having a few drinks, having a dance but also like getting a cheeky curry afterwards, not queuing hours for a taxi and being home early enough for Match of the Day - and then it also doesn't ruin your Sunday either. ""For me now, it's all about going out on a bit of an all-dayer - and I thought there's a real market for people with a similar vibe."" The discos are targeted at people over 30, where doors open at 14:00, last entry is 16:00 and party-goers are asked to be polite and encouraged to dress smart like they used to when they went on a night out clubbing. ""I'm really guilty for having a good dance in my kitchen alone - and I would much rather do it with my friends,"" Bafta winner Vicky said. ""Music is such a powerful thing for us all to have, it's one thing playing it in your headphones, your house or in your car but you're on a dance floor, with your mates it really does create a memory - and I'm all for music and memories as we do with our dementia choir."" DJs at their event can include Vicky herself, Jonny, and his daughter Radio 1 presenter Katie Owen who pick from classic party anthems chosen by DJ and Reverend and the Makers frontman Jon McClure. Their first day-time disco experiment in Sheffield City Hall last month sold out within 48 hours where Vicky and mum Carol led the dance floor charge. ""It started in a classic way where everybody stood round the edge of the dance floor,"" said the Trigger Point and Without Sin actress, who had recently been honoured by the King. ""But me and mum were the first two up dancing and it didn't take long before everybody followed - and it was completely packed."" Daytime dances have now been confirmed in London, Nottingham and south Wales as well as a return to Sheffield and organisers want to take their drop-in disco to towns and cities across the UK. ""We'd love to see it in different cities so everyone has access and we're getting loads of messages on our social media asking us to bring it to them,"" she added. ""And having it on your doorstep, close to your home is the whole point so you don't have to make late-night trips on the train, we want to make sure it's accessible to everybody. ""We've got to be really fair about ticket prices because we appreciate the world in which we live in and people want to be able to come and have a great time so we've got to make it affordable to everybody."" Vicky and Jonny's daytime disco includes a nostalgia fix on the big screens which includes clips from old school TV shows and films as well as retro television adverts. ""I'm terrible for scrolling down a nostalgia rabbit hole as we all love that once you get to a certain age,"" added Vicky, 40. An investigation by BBC Newsbeat found that more than half of all UK clubs shut down between 2005 and 2015 and Jonny wants to show that some people still want to dance and party, just a bit earlier than used to. Three of their next events - in Sheffield, Merthyr Tydfil and Nottingham - have already sold out while tickets for their day-time disco in London's Outernet in March are selling well, they said. ""It's better than going to the gym if we're going down the January new year's resolution route,"" said Vicky with a smile. ""And you don't stop moving as you're on your feet for hours.""","['Nottingham', 'Sheffield', 'Merthyr Tydfil', 'Nightclubs', 'Wales', 'London', 'Dance']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1370D/production/_132292697_dsc05651copy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15E1D/production/_132292698_dsc05790copy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/02D9/production/_132292700_dsc06326copy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/999/cpsprodpb/50F9/production/_132292702_dsc06036copy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/56AB/production/_132278122_dsc05702.jpg']","['By Peter Shuttleworth', 'BBC News']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

Cumming, who actually appeared in 1995 Bond film Goldeneye, says the  producers of the reality show wanted him to ""camp it up"" and host it as an over-the-top character.So he adopts an eccentric Scottish accent, quotes Shakespeare and pokes fun at the contestants - but Cumming says he is still heavily invested in the drama which he watches on live feeds in his dressing room.""I can see them. I do feel like a James Bond villain,"" he says while laughing and stroking an imaginary cat, mimicking one of 007's most famous adversaries Ernst Blofeld.In fact Cumming says that when he accepted the role, he suggested that he could bring his dog to stroke menacingly instead.The idea was not taken up for the first series because his dog Lala could not travel to Scotland for the filming. ""My dog's in the second one,"" Cumming says with a smile. Season two of the US version of The Traitors is currently airing, at the same time as the UK version - hosted by Claudia Winkleman on BBC One.Both are filmed at Ardross Castle in Easter Ross and involve ""faithful"" contestants trying to discover and eliminate the traitors in their midst.Cumming hosts the US version wearing increasingly flamboyant costumes, with accessories added as each episode progresses.He tells BBC Scotland's The Edit his exaggerated Scottish accent is ""me playing Moira Rose from Schitt's Creek playing Alan Cumming"". Cumming says the US version is also different because the contestants are all celebrities to some degree, generally reality TV stars. ""It heightens the drama, they understand how to do drama,"" he says. While UK viewers may not be familiar with many of the celebrities, there is one they might recognise.John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, is one of the more surprising contestants in the US show. Cumming says: ""It was fascinating to see what the Americans made of him because none of them knew who he was.""They thought he talked too much, and he did.""However, Cumming says: ""In the end, he became a team player."" He says he loved teasing Bercow during the filming of the show. ""It's hilarious, I loved bossing him about,"" Cumming says. ""Any opportunity to go, 'order, order, John,'."" Cumming, from Aberfeldy in Perthshire, made his acting debut in the 1980s and is perhaps best remembered in Scotland for the comedy series The High Life which he created with Forbes Masson.In the decades since he has appeared in dozens of films including Spy Kids and X-Men 2 as well as having a starring role in the US TV series The Good Wife.Now 58, Cumming is thinking more about ageing and it is the focus of his new solo tour, set to begin later this month, called Alan Cumming is Not Acting His Age.He describes the show as akin to an old-fashioned cabaret, featuring a performance filled with music and discussions covering a range of topics such as sex, death, and alcohol. Cumming says there are under-discussed positives to getting older.""You get wiser, you don't worry so much,"" he says. ""Wisdom is about realising life is a cyclical thing, the same things keep coming around. ""It's the same show with different costumes."" Cumming says realising this enables better decision-making later in life and being open to the possibility of new experiences.""We worship at the altar of youth,"" he says.""I talk about this in the show, why have we decided that something that is inevitable, inexorable, like ageing is the worst possible thing in the world? ""We need to find beauty in not just youth.""

She said other shows use the same landmarks so she ""banned all of that"" to showcase working class Bristol.

Nightingale joined the station in 1970 and remained the only woman on the line-up for 12 years. She was known for her passion for a wide range of music, championing everything from prog rock and punk to acid house and grime. She remained on air until late last year with Annie Nightingale Presents. Nightingale was also known for co-hosting BBC Two music show The Old Grey Whistle Test. Tributes have been flooding in, with DJ Annie Mac saying Nightingale was ""a trailblazer, spirited, adventurous, fearless, hilarious, smart, and so good at her job"". Writing on Instagram, she added: ""This is the woman who changed the face and sound of British TV and radio broadcasting forever. You can't underestimate it."" BBC Radio 2 presenter Zoe Ball said she was ""heartbroken"" at the news, adding: ""She loved music like no other, she sought out the tunes and artists that shaped our lives, she interviewed them all, opening doors for musicians, DJs and broadcasters alike."" Fellow Radio 2 host Jo Whiley said Nightingale was ""the coolest woman who ever graced the airwaves"". She added: ""She blazed a trail for us all and never compromised. Her passion for music never diminished."" 6 Music DJ and Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne thanked Nightingale ""for opening the door and for showing us all what to do when we got through it"", adding: ""You will be missed so much."" The news of Nightingale's death was announced on BBC Radio 1, with presenter Mollie King saying she had ""really championed female talent"". ""I think I can say I speak for myself and other women in broadcasting when I say we owe her an immense amount of gratitude for everything she has done."" Tim Davie, director general of the BBC, called Nightingale a ""uniquely gifted broadcaster"". He continued: ""As well as being a trailblazer for new music, she was a champion for female broadcasters, supporting and encouraging other women to enter the industry. We will all miss her terribly."" A statement attributed to her family on Friday said she ""passed away yesterday at her home in London after a short illness"". ""Annie was a pioneer, trailblazer and an inspiration to many. Her impulse to share that enthusiasm with audiences remained undimmed after six decades of broadcasting on BBC TV and radio globally. ""Never underestimate the role model she became. Breaking down doors by refusing to bow down to sexual prejudice and male fear gave encouragement to generations of young women who, like Annie, only wanted to tell you about an amazing tune they had just heard. ""Watching Annie do this on television in the 1970s, most famously as a presenter on the BBC music show The Old Grey Whistle Test, or hearing her play the latest breakbeat techno on Radio One is testimony to someone who never stopped believing in the magic of rock 'n' roll."" They added that a celebration of her life would take place at a memorial service in the spring. Nightingale famously presented Radio 1's Request Show in the 1970s, 80s and 90s before moving to an overnight slot. She also hosted occasional shows on Radio 2, 5 Live and 6 Music, as well as a range of documentaries. ""Every week, in my job, is a new adventure. I enjoy it,"" she said last July. ""People don't understand. Most people get bored with pop music when they're a certain age. I go on being interested in where it's going, the twists and turns."" Radio 1's current boss Aled Haydn Jones said in a statement: ""All of us at Radio 1 are devastated to lose Annie, our thoughts are with her family and friends."" He added: ""She was the first female DJ on Radio 1 and over her 50 years on the station was a pioneer for women in the industry and in dance music. We have lost a broadcasting legend."" Radio 1 presenter Greg James wrote on X that Nightingale's life and achievements had been ""so extraordinary you couldn't possibly sum them up on here"". Glastonbury Festival co-organiser Emily Eavis said she had been ""an inspiration to so many women in music"" and a ""lovely human being"". She added: ""Goodbye dear Annie, a female trailblazer and true enthusiast."" Nightingale was last on air with a three-part ""best of 2023"" show on 19 December. After playing tracks by Dimitri Vegas, Daft Punk, Sam Smith and Bad Bunny she signed off by wishing listeners ""a brilliant Christmas"". Her final words on Radio 1 were, appropriately, ""lots of love, from me to you"".","['Radio', 'BBC', 'Music']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EA05/production/_132290995_6751dc93cf61f3bf1caa71f387ca4b2ec005f4a4.jpg'],"['By Ian Youngs & Noor Nanji', 'BBC News']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

No other details were given of the buyer, but the auction house said competition had been fierce - with 219 pre-sale bids placed from all over the world.

The Lords' Day, which was published in 2007, is a tale about a security breach at the State Opening of Parliament. Its author, Michael Dobbs, told the BBC he was ""utterly surprised, overjoyed, very excited and rather deeply humbled"" that his thriller had been selected. He added that the move showed the Queen had ""a fantastic sense of humour"". In the book, the late Queen Elizabeth and the then-Prince Charles are among those held captive during a siege of the House of Lords. It was ""controversial"" when it first came out, Dobbs said, because it talked about possible security flaws in Parliament. But he said people eventually understood that he was not ""writing a manual for terrorists"". ""I was writing a novel which gave solutions on security, and it helped toughen up that security,"" he added. Dobbs, himself a member of the House of Lords, has also written other books including the original House of Cards. He sent a copy of The Lords' Day to the new King and Queen about a year ago ""for a chuckle"". ""I didn't expect them to read it, they are busy people,"" he added. He learned about the inclusion of his book on The Queen's Reading Room book list, as first reported by The Telegraph, about three weeks ago from his publisher. ""I was bowled over when I found out,"" he said. ""If you look at her previous choices, you have the likes of Dickens, Tolstoy, and some of the greatest modern authors on the list, and to have a Dobbs novel included was totally unexpected. ""The Queen is very serious about getting people to read, and opening up people's minds, which is what books do best,"" he added. The King carried out the State Opening of Parliament for the first time as monarch last November, accompanied by the Queen. The ceremony, dating back to the 15th Century, marks the start of a parliamentary session, bringing together the constituent parts of Parliament - the Crown, peers and MPs. The Queen's Reading Room launched as an online book club on Instagram, before becoming a charity last February. It includes a list of reading recommendations from the Queen herself. Other books on the list include Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo, and The Year of Eating Dangerously, by the Queen's son Tom Parker Bowles. The organisation also hosts an annual literary festival and has launched a new podcast.

The US comedian spent a few months based just outside Belfast, at the Culloden Hotel, last year. During his stay, he performed a number of gigs in the city - some of which were a surprise - at the Limelight venue and Lavery's bar. Lift is the second Netflix film to be shot in Northern Ireland following The School for Good and Evil in 2021. It was filmed in Harbour Studios and on location across Northern Ireland, with support from Northern Ireland Screen. Ulster University, Titanic Hotel, the Crown Liquor Saloon and Riddel's Warehouse in Belfast, Castle Ward near Strangford, Shackleton Barracks in Ballykelly, Ward Park in Bangor, Whitehead railway station and Ardglass harbour were among the locations used. Directed by F Gary Gray, Lift sees an international heist crew, led by Kevin Hart's character Cyrus Whitaker, try to take $500m (£393m) in gold from a passenger plane before it ends up in the wrong hands. Chief executive of Northern Ireland Screen Richard Williams said: ""The dedication and craftmanship of the local crew complemented the work of global players Kevin Hart and F Gary Gray to bring this eagerly anticipated film to life."" Last year the UK government said that screen productions in Northern Ireland have directly contributed more than £330m to the local economy since 2018. While filming in Belfast, Philadelphia native Hart did a number of comedy shows in venues around the city. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster Programme, local comedian Paddy McDonnell told the story of how this came about. ""I do know that he did think about doing a comedy set in Belfast because he had never done it and went down and watched comedy incognito and then [said], 'Maybe we'll approach these guys and do one without telling the audience' - and that's exactly what happened."" Hart made his surprise appearance in Lavery's on St Patrick's Day 2022 and went on to perform at other venues including the Limelight and the SSE arena. Mr Williams told the programme that the fact that Hart apparently had a good time while in Belfast would be good for Northern Ireland's entertainment industry. ""The development of a cultural scene, of a creative industry scene, is all about word of mouth. It's all about reputation: it's all about what people say about it.""","['Belfast', 'Kevin Hart']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A386/production/_116926814_gettyimages-1193044293.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8D6A/production/_127520263_belfastharbourstudios.jpg']",,Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

The network has said the ploy was ""a misguided attempt"" to recognise on-air talent that were not eligible for certain categories. The awards won were reportedly re-engraved with the real names of the on-air personalities. The sports network has apologised. Details of the ploy were first uncovered in a report on Thursday by sports publication The Athletic. The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS), the organisation behind the Emmys, told The Athletic that it had ""identified a number of fictitious credits submitted by ESPN to multiple Sports Emmys competitions"". NATAS then notified ESPN's senior management of this finding, who has since apologised and reprimanded those who were responsible. The Athletic's report centred around ESPN's ""College GameDay"" programme, which nabbed eight Emmys for Outstanding Weekly Studio Show between 2008 and 2018. Until 2023, that category prohibited submissions from on-air talent in an effort to avoid duplicate wins for a single programme. On-air personalities could instead submit for other categories, like Outstanding Host or Emerging On-Air Talent. In a bid to secure awards for their on-air talent, the network reportedly circumvented eligibility rules by submitting entries with fake names credited for the programme. The fake names were similar to those of the on-air personalities, with the same initials but slightly altered. There is no evidence suggesting the on-air personalities were aware of the submissions or the ploy. In a statement to the BBC, ESPN spokesperson Julie McKay said the ploy involved award submissions that may date back as far back as 1997. ""This was a misguided attempt to recognize on-air individuals who were important members of our production team, "" Ms McKay said in an email.  ""Once current leadership was made aware, we apologized to [The National Academy for Television Arts and Sciences] for violating guidelines."" Ms McKay said the network has brought in outside counsel to conduct ""a full and thorough investigation."" She added those who were responsible were disciplined by ESPN. Along with being forced to return the statuettes, NATAS said it has also imposed a one-year disqualification from award eligibility for the senior leadership of ""College GameDay"".","['United States', 'Emmy Awards']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15FB6/production/_132283009_gettyimages-1243175519.jpg'],"['By Nadine Yousif', 'BBC News']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67911167,Annapoorani: Netflix removes Nayanthara film after backlash from Hindu groups,"An Indian film that received backlash for ""hurting Hindu religious sentiments"" has been removed from Netflix, days after it began streaming.",2024-01-12,"An Indian film that received backlash for ""hurting Hindu religious sentiments"" has been removed from Netflix, days after it began streaming. Netflix said the Tamil-language film - Annapoorani: The Goddess of Food - was removed at its ""licensor's request"". The movie stars actor Nayanthara as a Hindu Brahmin woman who aspires to become a chef. She is shown going against her family's religious beliefs and eating meat and learning to cook it. Many Brahmins do not eat meat, in accordance with rigid caste rules. Members of hard-line Hindu organisations had objected to this and other scenes in the movie, including one where the actress is shown offering namaz, or Muslim prayers, before cooking biriyani. Some Hindus also took offence at a scene where a Muslim character says that Hindu god Ram ate meat. The film's producers have not officially commented on the issue yet. A police case has also been filed  in Madhya Pradesh state against Nayanthara and two others associated with the film. Supporters of hard-line Hindu groups have accused many films and shows in recent years of insulting religious sentiments. In 2021, the cast and crew of an Amazon Prime show, Tandav, apologised after being accused of mocking Hindu gods. Annapoorani released in theatres on 1 December and got mixed reviews from critics - it was praised for showing a woman from an orthodox family following her dreams, but some called it ""an-all-you-can-eat buffet of undercooked subplots"". It was cleared by India's Central Board of Film Certification - known as the censor board - which reviews movies for public exhibition. But the controversy began weeks later when people watched it on Netflix, where it began streaming on 29 December. Last week, a man named Ramesh Solanki filed a police complaint in Mumbai objecting to several scenes - a case hasn't been registered there yet. Mr Solanki describes himself as a ""proud Hindu Indian nationalist"" on X (formerly Twitter). Reuters reported that members of the hard-line Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) shouted slogans outside the Netflix office in Mumbai. On Thursday, Mr Solanki and a VHP spokesperson shared a letter of apology from Zee Entertainment Enterprises - the parent company of Zee Studios, which co-produced Annapoorani. ""We have no intentions as co-producers of the film to hurt the religious sentiments of the Hindus and Brahmins community,"" the letter said. It also said the producers would address the concerns about the film and were working with Netflix to remove the film from its platform ""until edited"". Zee did not respond to the BBC's email seeking comment. While some said they were happy at the movie being taken off Netflix, others have expressed dismay. Actress Parvathy Thiruvothu said this would set a ""dangerous precedent"". Additional reporting by Nikhila Henry in Delhi BBC News India is now on YouTube.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67943787,David Oyelowo on The After: I had to crack open my heart for this role,"Actors often trawl some of their deepest emotions for a role, but David Oyelowo's latest film was particularly painful because it meant revisiting his grief after losing both parents.",2024-01-12,"Actors often trawl some of their deepest emotions for a role, but David Oyelowo's latest film was particularly painful because it meant revisiting his grief after losing both parents. The Golden Globe-nominated star said he felt ""fear and trepidation"" when he was asked to star in short film The After. ""I knew it would require cracking open my heart and just letting the world in somehow,"" he tells the BBC. But his fear was ""the reason I eventually felt I had to do it"", he says. The After follows Dayo, played by Oyelowo, who goes through an unexpected, catastrophic and brutal loss. In the blink of an eye, his entire life is changed forever and engulfed in grief. Oyelowo says he felt ""very safe"" in the hands of director and co-writer Misan Harriman. Harriman was the first black male photographer to shoot the cover of Vogue in its 104-year history in 2020, and was also chosen by Duke and Duchess of Sussex to photograph their daughter Lilibet for her first birthday. Having become a photographer a mere seven years ago (he used to be a City headhunter), Harriman has also taken pictures of celebrities including Rihanna, Stormzy, Olivia Colman, Princess Beatrice, Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Tom Cruise. And he took one of the most arresting images of 2020's Black Lives Matters protests, of under-21 England hockey player Darcy Bourne outside the US Embassy. The photo went on to be widely shared by names including Vogue editor Edward Enninful, athlete Dina Asher-Smith, Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and activist Martin Luther King III. According to Vogue, the image led to him being asked to do the cover for its activism-themed September 2020 issue. London's newspaper The Standard called him ""the most talked about photographer of our times"" that year. Oyelowo said he was ""stopped in my tracks"" by Harriman's premise for his film. ""I had my own personal grief journey I was going through,"" he says. ""I had lost my mother in 2017 and then my dad in 2020."" Ultimately he found the role cathartic, having researched it by watching resources about grief, and seeing ""the commonality - that human existence is a shared experience"". ""The more you recognise that, and realise that beyond race, gender, culture, country - you feel connected to something,"" he adds. The actor was careful not to speak to other people about their experiences because ""it's so personal, and you never want to exacerbate someone's grief journey by it feeling like you're now using it to for an artistic endeavour that they are not necessarily connected to"". Harriman, who came up with the idea of the film, which written by John Julius Schwabach, talks about the ""mental health crisis"" after the Covid pandemic. He says he doesn't think it's over. ""I think we are still seeing the mental health repercussions of that. ""I wanted to make a film that allowed vulnerability to be seen, with no filters, so people could see pieces of their own journeys of grief and anxiety, and find pieces of themselves in that film, with a view to them having an understanding that they can build themselves back up."" He says he speaks a lot to young people who ""had so much taken away from them"", adding that ""chronic depression is of the highest it's ever been"". ""We are not OK,"" he says. ""I wanted to make a companion piece to all of that concern, to try and have people understand that it is OK not to be OK. And it's all right to sometimes to be sat on the floor and not have the answers. ""I think the stakes are that high right now."" In The After, we see Dayo trying to carry on with life through his grief, as a rideshare driver, where he is in close proximity to other people but is emotionally isolated. Oyelowo explains that ""one of the things we tried to do with the film is to show that loneliness is something that can happen when you're in a crowd"". The film is one of 15 to be shortlisted for best live action short at the Oscars, with the nominations announced on 23 January, including five contenders in that category. Oyelowo is no stranger to awards ceremonies. ""I've done this dance before... so for me, the fact that this is Misan's first film, to even be on the shortlist for the Oscars is kind of bonkers,"" he says. Harriman adds: ""I'm someone who suffers from pretty bad imposter syndrome, so this has been quite good for that."" Oyelowo starred in 2015's film Selma, about the marches led by Dr Martin Luther King as he tried to secure the right of African Americans to vote freely. That film was nominated for two Oscars, including best film, and won best original song, but was snubbed at the Baftas. Last year's Bafta film awards came under fire after all the winners at the ceremony were white, despite the fact it had a diverse set of nominees, with people belonging to ethnic minorities making up almost 40% of acting nominees. It came three years after an outcry and subsequent reforms when all 20 acting nominees were white. Does Oyelowo think Bafta has more work to do on diversity? He responds by saying simply: ""It speaks for itself."" Oyelowo says he hopes the film shows people ""the things they need to confront, or the things that they just need to accept. Ultimately where we tried to land is in a place of hope"". He adds: ""Even in my own grief journey, there is there is beauty. There is hope, there is love in many ways. ""Loss defines love and love defines loss. True loss can only exist if there was true love. And you know, I wouldn't swap having true love in my life."" The After is available to watch on Netflix.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67930651,'I drew abs on my stomach - now I'm a Gladiator',"What do a former firefighter, a professional sprinter and the UK's fittest man have in common?",2024-01-12,"What do a former firefighter, a professional sprinter and the UK's fittest man have in common? Unfortunately for contenders in the BBC's upcoming reboot of Gladiators, they stand united against those willing to take them on in a series of gruelling and sinew-straining events. Are you ready? The BBC will be hoping the show, returning to screens on Saturday, can replicate the success of the programme, which was first broadcast in the UK on ITV on 10 October 1992, before it ended in 2000. Twenty-four years later, three of the 16 Gladiators competing in the new series have spoken of their journeys. Gladiators Zack George, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Jamie Christian Johal are representing the East Midlands. With an impressive sporting background, the trio say most importantly, they are hoping to inspire the young generation. Zack - aka Steel - says his life has changed for the better, thanks to Gladiators, after growing up overweight as a child. Zack lives in Loughborough - the town that is home to Loughborough University, which has trained and played host to a number of legendary athletes, such as Paula Radcliffe, Lord Seb Coe and Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson. ""When I was a child, I had pretty much the opposite of what I have now,"" he told the BBC. ""I was very self-conscious of how I looked. I used to skip swimming lessons at school to not take my top off. ""I used to eat McDonald's and KFC four times a week and sweets every day, and hated to exercise. ""But I used to really look up to the Gladiators. I used to look up to these guys' physiques and I'd liked to pretend that I was going to be like that one day. ""I used to draw abs on my stomach - like drawing sticks on a pot belly."" Zack, whose strength has earned him the name Steel, won the title of the UK's Fittest Man in 2020, and he also ranked 26 out of 126,461 on the global CrossFit leaderboard. Swapping the burgers for a healthy diet and intense exercise, the 33-year-old says his mission as one of the Gladiators is to ""inspire and motivate the next generation watching the show"". This is, however, just one of the shared aims of the tough triumvirate. ""We're brought to this platform to entertain the show"", says Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who describes himself as an energetic competitor. Harry, a sprinter from Leicestershire, says he confronts contenders with a smile on his face. The 35-year-old has been leaving competitors in the dust from a young age, becoming the first athlete to win gold medals at both 100m and 200m at the World Youth Championships. In 2005, he won the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, aged 17, and said he was the fastest 14-year-old of all time in Europe. Harry went on to win four gold medals in the men's 100m European Championships and at the Commonwealth Games. It is this raw speed and fire that earned the Olympian the name Nitro in Gladiators. ""I was gifted from a young age,"" he added. Now wearing the electric blue costume alongside the two other Gladiators, he said: ""It's a celebration of what we are and what we've done."" While keeping the nostalgic '90s feel of the original show, the latest series will bring new games enhanced by effects and technology. ""With the advance of social media, I think you're going to know the Gladiators a lot more,"" Jamie Christian Johal said. Standing at 6ft 5in (1.95m), the former firefighter turned bodybuilder - known more accurately as Giant - said: ""It's really a cream of the crop in terms of athletic ability. ""The show was so iconic before, and we all watched it. The feeling I had watching it as a kid was of looking up to these seemingly-immortal characters at the time. ""Being young and obviously not experiencing anybody of that size before, I was just in awe of what they could do."" Jamie, 38, who served Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service for seven years, said Gladiators ""inspired the youth of yesterday"". He added: ""Now hopefully I can do the same and encourage the Gladiators of the future and children to get into fitness and just attack life - and be the best person they can be."" The series was filmed in June at the Utilita Arena in Sheffield, in front of an audience of 3,000 people. Soon, many more will witness the reignition of a competition that stayed with millions for decades. Gladiators starts on Saturday at 17:50 GMT on BBC One and iPlayer.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67884743,Post Office lied and threatened BBC over Horizon whistleblower,The Post Office threatened and lied to the BBC in a failed effort to suppress key evidence that helped clear postmasters in the Horizon scandal.,2024-01-12,"The Post Office threatened and lied to the BBC in a failed effort to suppress key evidence that helped clear postmasters in the Horizon scandal. Senior managers tried to smear postmasters before Panorama broadcast an interview in 2015 with a Fujitsu whistleblower. Former insider Richard Roll revealed accounts on the Horizon computer system could be secretly altered. The Post Office declined to comment while the public inquiry is ongoing. Mr Roll would go on to play a crucial part in a 2019 High Court case which ruled that bugs could cause errors in the Post Office computer system intended to keep track of transactions in local branches. Between 1999 and 2015, 700 sub-postmasters and postmistresses - self-employed people who run Post Office branches - were prosecuted for offences such as theft, fraud and false accounting, with some going to prison and others even taking their own lives. The BBC can reveal that in the period leading up to the broadcast of Trouble at the Post Office, the 2015 Panorama programme featuring the whistleblower testimony: The Post Office's false claims did not stop the programme, but they did cause the BBC to delay the broadcast by several weeks. Documents submitted to the ongoing public inquiry reveal how that small victory was celebrated by Post Office senior management. Then-chief executive Paula Vennells congratulated Mark Davies and his PR team on their ""extensive work"". This was just the latest in a long line of lobbying, misinformation and outright lies that had faced a small number of BBC journalists trying to uncover the truth about the Post Office scandal. It began in 2011, when then-BBC regional reporter Nick Wallis first interviewed Jo Hamilton, played by Monica Dolan in the ITV drama Mr Bates v The Post Office. She told him how the Horizon computer system had made money seem to vanish from the tills at her branch in Hampshire. The Post Office said there was ""no evidence pointing to any fault in the technology"". By 2014, Nick Wallis and producer Tim Robinson were investigating new claims - for BBC regional investigative programme Inside Out - that staff at Fujitsu were able to remotely tamper with Horizon accounts. They interviewed sub-postmaster Michael Rudkin, played by Shaun Dooley in the TV drama, who said he had seen Fujitsu staff tampering with accounts on a visit to the company's head office The Post Office told the BBC journalists at the time there was ""no functionality in Horizon for either a branch, Post Office or Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or remove transaction data"" and that it had found ""no evidence"" to suggest that convictions were unsafe. We now know that 18 months before this statement, a barrister had warned senior Post Office managers a number of prosecutions might be unsafe because of bugs in the system that had not been disclosed in court cases against the sub-postmasters. Rather than admit the truth, the Post Office continued to spread misinformation. And minutes of a Post Office meeting later uncovered in court show its PR boss Mark Davies directly lobbied senior BBC management to try to stop further negative coverage of the story. ""While we are able to withstand this current level of interest, it is resource intensive. We have made representations to the director of BBC News and Current Affairs,"" Mr Davies told colleagues. The Post Office cover-up was holding, but Alan Bates - the hero of the ITV drama - had another card to play. At a meeting in a garden centre tea room in Shrewsbury, he told Nick Wallis he had been contacted by a whistleblower from Fujitsu - who knew the truth about Horizon and remote access. That man was Richard Roll, who had worked for Fujitsu on the Post Office's Horizon computer system in the early 2000s. Mr Bates wanted Panorama to take on the story, so Nick introduced the whistleblower to the programme team. For the 2015 programme, he told Panorama reporter John Sweeney on camera how a team of Fujitsu staff had remote access to branch accounts and could make changes to them without the sub-postmasters' knowledge. It was explosive testimony that could call into question the convictions of more than 700 sub-postmasters prosecuted on the basis of Horizon evidence, as the denial of the possibility of remote access underpinned the Post Office's legal position. The Post Office was going to fight hard to stop the story from coming out - its misinformation campaign ramped up a gear. Panorama journalists Matt Bardo and Tim Robinson were invited to Post Office HQ for an on-the-record briefing about the Horizon system. Network manager Angela van den Bogerd joined PR boss Mark Davies and another senior manager, Patrick Bourke. Ms van den Bogerd insisted nobody could change the sub-postmasters' accounts without their knowledge. She said any alterations ""would leave a footprint. And that's the important bit."" Matt Bardo asked: ""So in sum, it is not now and never has been possible for anybody from Post Office or Fujitsu to interfere with transactions, without the clear knowledge of the sub-postmaster?"" Mr Bourke said: ""It is 100% true to say we can't change, alter, modify, existing transaction data, so the integrity is 100% preserved."" ""And that's true now and has been for the duration of the system?"" Mr Bardo asked. ""Yeah,"" said Ms van den Bogerd. That wasn't true. Not then, and not for the duration of the system. Since then, the Post Office has been forced to accept that Fujitsu staff could access and change accounts without the sub-postmasters' knowledge. One of the Post Office's lawyers suggested in 2019 that Angela van den Bogerd and her colleagues had denied remote access was possible because they did not know at the time. He told the High Court: ""It is a matter of enormous regret that the senior managers who dealt with Panorama were not aware that remote access to Horizon was possible."" But documents Panorama obtained for a follow-up programme in 2020 show the Post Office had known it was possible for years. A report by consultants Ernst and Young sent to Post Office directors in 2011 warned that Fujitsu staff had ""unrestricted access"" to sub-postmasters' accounts, that ""may lead to the processing of unauthorised or erroneous transactions"". The misleading on-the-record briefing was just the first step in the Post Office's onslaught to frustrate the 2015 Panorama investigation. When it learned the names of experts Panorama was interviewing, lawyers and senior managers sent them intimidating letters. Ian Henderson, from the independent forensic accountants Second Sight, had uncovered other evidence of miscarriages of justice at the Post Office. He was warned he did not have the legal expertise to comment on prosecutions and the Post Office threatened to sue him. ""If your statements go as far as to harm Post Office's reputation then we may have to take even more serious action in order to protect our brand,"" he was told. ""For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office does not condone you speaking to Panorama and all our legal rights are fully reserved."" To protect the whistleblower from similar correspondence, the Panorama team did not tell the Post Office Richard Roll's name. Instead, the journalists said they had spoken to a Fujitsu insider, and outlined the allegations he was making. From the Post Office's response, it was clear that the whistleblower's evidence which would be featured in the film was of particular concern. PR boss Mark Davies fired off complaints to ever more senior managers at the BBC, and expensive external lawyers were hired with public money to send letters threatening to sue Panorama. The programme team received hundreds of pages of correspondence and reports from the Post Office and their lawyers - but none of the paperwork admitted remote access was possible. At the time, Mr Davies told Panorama ""there is overwhelming evidence that the losses complained of were caused by user actions, including deliberate dishonest conduct"". The Post Office's lobbying did secure them a further meeting, this time an off-the-record briefing with the programme's then-editor. Such meetings are viewed with suspicion by many investigative journalists as they can be used as a tactic to hamper inquiries and publication. So it proved in this case. The Post Office took the opportunity to smear some of the sub-postmasters Panorama was planning to feature in its programme, hinting at potential motives to steal from the tills. In one case, it falsely claimed it had documents showing a postmaster was guilty of theft. But it said it would only show them to the programme team if they promised not to share them with anyone else - which meant Panorama would not even be able to discuss them with the postmaster who had been accused. Panorama refused. The team reviewed all the available evidence, which delayed the broadcast. But nothing was found that cast doubt on the sub-postmasters' stories and the film aired in August 2015. It can often be a struggle to get a Panorama to air. It's not unusual for big companies and wealthy individuals to mount intensive legal and lobbying efforts to protect their reputations. But for the programme team, this was a battle like few others - and it was a government-owned institution that was waging the war. The Post Office had failed to stop Richard Roll's story being told, but it still sought to reduce its impact. After the programme aired, the Post Office immediately published a statement on its website that said it would be complaining to the BBC about the ""unsubstantiated allegations that continue to be made"". Richard Roll's allegations were not picked up by the rest of the media and his testimony did not spark the national outrage that has followed ITV's drama. Post Office CEO Paula Vennells reported back to the government body which owns the Post Office that ""the programme contained no new information and received almost no pick-up from other media"". Mrs Vennells made no mention of the new information provided by the whistleblower. But all was not lost. Panorama from 2015 - Trouble at the Post Office The Post Office has prosecuted dozens of postmasters after their computers showed that money had gone missing. Reporter John Sweeney meets a whistleblower who says there were problems with the computer system. And he investigates claims that the Post Office charged some postmasters with theft even when the evidence didn't stack up. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) The programme had an impact on one important viewer, which would prove to be a pivotal moment in the story. Lawyer Patrick Green KC immediately realised the significance of Richard Roll's testimony. The barrister went on to lead the postmasters' legal case that showed Horizon could be to blame for unexpected shortfalls. Panorama's whistleblower appeared as a witness at the High Court in March 2019 and his account played a key part in discrediting the Post Office's insistence that remote access to the branch accounts was not possible. Mr Green later told Panorama how important the 2015 programme had been to their victory. He said: ""I'm not sure that this litigation would've happened as it did had Panorama not made that programme."" The postmasters' victory over the Post Office at the High Court was the turning of the legal tide and led to the overturning of convictions at the Court of Appeal. Lawyers for Mark Davies told Panorama he had acted at all times entirely in good faith and that his statements had been based on the information he was given at the time. ""Our client was doing his job… to ensure that any coverage of this matter was fair and accurate,"" they said. And Paula Vennells now says: ""I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system."" But for years, the Post Office tried to suppress crucial evidence. The Post Office knew in 2015 that there were bugs and errors in Horizon. It knew that remote access was possible. And it knew some of its convictions were unsafe. The evidence in Panorama's 2015 film was there for the government to see too. But it took several trials, more than 90 overturned convictions and a TV drama for the Post Office scandal to get the attention it has long deserved.

But in one west coast village a group of women, some in their 80s, have taken up the normally lively sport for the very first time.The Snowdrop Seniors, who are based in Lochgilphead, are developing their skills with the caman (stick) and ball while walking or even sitting in their chairs. They say it helps keep them physically and mentally healthy - and improves their social life. Heather Cameron, 89, is among those taking part at the sessions at Lochgilphead's Multiple Sclerosis Centre - better known as Snowdrop Argyll. The centre supports people affected by neurological and other long-term conditions, or who have been feeling the effects of social isolation.The former hotel manageress, who is originally from England and moved to Argyll 50 years ago, said she had not known about shinty until her grandsons started playing when they were pupils at the local high school.""We used to go along to egg them on, standing in the freezing cold shouting their names. They are in their 20s now and still play,"" she said.""Until I came here I didn't know about shinty at all. I didn't know anything about it until the boys started playing.""""It's great fun. Everybody can join in and it is a team game."" Former nurse of 40 years' service Barbara Millar is 80 and also trying out shinty for the first time.She said: ""There is no judgement of folks' capabilities. It's very good and everyone participates."" The women joked that the sessions could get competitive at times.The sessions are led by wellbeing development worker and shinty coach Laurene Cameron. She hopes to hold an outdoor session in the summer involving players from the local women's club.""They are very good at wanting to learn new skills and it is something a little different that they can talk about to their friends and family,"" she said. The coach said shinty was for all age groups and should not be limited to younger generations.She said: ""It's a great way to learn new skills, improve your hand-eye coordination, improves balance and more importantly it's fun and a great way to socialise.""We have been pleasantly surprised by the response we have had and hope to continue to build the group over the next few months.""The scheme has been working with Age Scotland and also Shinty Memories Scotland - a mental health project involving a network of groups set up in shinty-playing communities, including in Badenoch, Lochaber and Beauly.Social events are held to bring people together to look at archive images and videos of the sport. Shinty's governing body, the Camanachd Association, said it was thrilled the Snowdrop Seniors had embraced the ""spirit of shinty"".A spokesman said: ""It's heartening to see how our sport unites generations, proving that age is no barrier to the joy of shinty.

British Medical Association (BMA) members called it a last resort to stop more leaving due to pay erosion. Dr Emily Sams said they were offered less than England and Scotland, meaning they ""don't need to go halfway around the world to Australia for better pay"". Health Minister Eluned Morgan reassured people that urgent and life-threatening care will continue to be provided. ""We are disappointed junior doctors have voted for industrial action, but we understand the strength of feeling among BMA members,"" said Ms Morgan. ""We would like to address their pay restoration ambitions, but the pay award offer we have made is at the limits of the finances available to us and reflects the position reached with the other unions. ""We continue to press the UK government to pass on the funding necessary to provide full and fair pay rises for public sector workers."" Ms Morgan encouraged people who need to attend an emergency department to still do so throughout the strike action, and for others to consider ""the best option for them"", including using the 111 online or phone service, or go to their local pharmacy. She said non-emergency and elective appointments and treatments are expected to be stood down, with services resembling bank holiday staffing. All seven health boards said patients should still attend appointments unless they have been contacted directly not to. Cardiff and Vale Health Board said it plans to continue all urgent and emergency services throughout the strike. Aneurin Bevan and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boards said their emergency departments and critical care services will continue to be available for the most serious and urgent patients. Hywel Dda University and Swansea Bay health boards said they expects planned care services to be impacted and will ""prioritise patients with urgent care needs wherever possible"". There are about 4,000 junior doctors working in Wales, making up 40% of its total medical workforce, mainly in hospitals. Nearly a quarter work for Cardiff and Vale health board, which provides a large proportion of highly specialised treatment like neurosurgery and transplants. It means the impact on planned services will be significant. It is understood 75% of outpatient appointments and 80% of operations will not take place, to free up more senior staff to cover shifts around the clock. The BMA in Wales has planned a three-day strike from 07:00 GMT Monday January 15 until 07:00 the following Thursday in a dispute over pay. Its members have already been given a 5% rise by the Welsh government, which is below the 6% recommended by the independent remuneration body. In England, junior doctors have already been given 8.8%, but have rejected an additional offer worth 3% on average. In Scotland, an improved offer of 12.4% has been accepted, while in Northern Ireland a ballot is planned. Dr Sams is a general surgical trainee and a BMA Wales representative who graduated seven years ago and now works in south east Wales. She said of the colleagues she graduated alongside, 10 have since moved to Australia, many with the intention of staying a year or two, but have delayed plans to return while the pay disparity remains. Dr Sams said the pay increase for junior doctors in Wales represents the lowest rate of anywhere in the UK. ""We're at a point now in Wales where doctors don't need to go halfway around the world to Australia for better pay and better working conditions,"" she said. ""Doctors will look across the border to England and Scotland."" She said for a long time Wales had struggled to attract trainees with contracts on offer across the border. ""And the pay now is much worse than it is in England and Scotland,"" she added. ""It means we're not attracting the best doctors to Wales. It means there will be more rota gaps. Our patients deserve more, we deserve to have the best doctors working here."" Health bosses will not know exactly how many staff will take part in the industrial action until the day, but significant disruption is expected. Donna Coleman, regional director for health and social care body Llais in west Wales, said: ""People already know they're going to have sometimes very long waits for some kinds of surgery, so when they see this further disruption on top it's even more devastating for them. ""They just absolutely are at a loss with what to do and plan for their lives ahead."" Industrial action by junior doctors in England featured prominently during 2023, with six days of action at the start of this year, but this is the first time their colleagues in Wales will have taken to the picket lines. Junior doctor is the broad title given to anyone who has graduated from medical school but is yet to qualify as a consultant, and can include doctors with nine years or more experience.","['Wales', 'Doctors', 'Welsh government']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/484D/production/_132190581_26454c0914625932e62b048d1042a44c3b0a501b.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/15DF/production/_107899550_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/15DF/production/_107899550_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8988/production/_132280253_mediaitem132280252.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10526/production/_123745866_gettyimages-1237658203.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['By Jenny Rees', 'BBC Wales health correspondent']",Health,Health

Daisy Bull died in December after being diagnosed with cancer in her kidney three years ago. Hundreds of people stood by the side of roads in Retford in Nottinghamshire to pay their respects to Daisy. Part of the seven-mile route went past Daisy's school, where the children applauded as Daisy's coffin and the convoy went past. Daisy's mum, Sally Bull, said her daughter ""was something else"". ""She was a little bit different from your average 12-year-old,"" Mrs Bull said. ""She loved lorries and went everywhere with her dad in his lorry."" Daisy came from a family of lorry drivers, and her mum thinks she would have grown up to be a professional lorry driver too. Daisy was originally diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a type of kidney cancer found in children. She had her kidney removed and chemotherapy, and was given the all-clear. The cancer came back, but she was given the all-clear a second time after further chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the cancer then spread to her chest wall, and she died on 21 December. Nick Bull, Daisy's father, said she ""fought so hard and won the first two battles but wasn't strong enough to win the war"". Daisy's coffin was on the back of a green and white Scania 730, driven by her dad, who runs a haulage company. Daisy's uncle drove the lorry behind, and her cousin drove another lorry. Mrs Bull said the funeral convoy was ""very different but very nice"". ""We are a massive lorry family with crazy lorry friends,"" she said.

The trust has declined to comment further. The changes being made to senior management do not relate to the impending CQC inspection report, according to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), external.The trust had been rated outstanding, but that was withdrawn after ""significant disparities"" between the 2019 ranking and recent inspection findings. Sir Jim Mackey has been chief executive since the start of 2024, and more senior staff changes are coming up. Signs of issues at the hospitals became apparent in 2023, when inspectors issued a warning notice saying immediate action was needed to improve the quality and safety of care given to patients with mental health needs, autism, or learning disabilities.The RVI's maternity services were also rated as needing improvement.There were also problems with the IT system, which failed to send out 24,000 medical letters to GPs. Under the new leadership, there are also moves to work more closely with other hospitals with the launch of the Great North Care Alliance in April.It will mean closer working between Newcastle, Northumbria, Gateshead, and North Cumbria.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2qyy0q77ywo,Children’s hospital inundated with measles cases,,2024-01-12,"Birmingham Children’s Hospital has been inundated with the highest number in decades of youngsters with measles, health officials say.Within the last month, there have been more than 50 children in need of treatment, the highest it has seen in years.It comes as UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show the West Midlands had at least 167 laboratory confirmed cases with a further 88 likely cases.A low vaccination rate of about 5% has been attributed to the rise. The UKHSA has confirmed the West Midlands has seen the largest outbreak of the infection in the country outside of London.Across Europe, up to October last year there were 30,000 confirmed cases whereas the previous year there were just 941. Around 80% of cases have been seen in Birmingham, with about 10% in Coventry, with other local authority areas seeing a rise in cases.One school, the Frederick Bird Academy, in Coventry, has been holding measles vaccination clinics after two pupils were taken to hospital with the disease.Parts of Birmingham and the Black Country have among the lowest vaccination rates in the UK.Dr Naveed Syed a consultant in health protection for UKHSA believes “fake news” and fears surrounding vaccination prompted by the coronavirus are behind the reluctance to have the two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab. The main symptoms of measles include a high fever, sore and red watery eyes, coughing, sneezing and a rash that usually appears after initial symptoms.“In a typical winter we would see no cases of measles at all,” Dr Neil Bugg, deputy medical director at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said.He added: “It’s because it’s so contagious, if you put a child with measles in a room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine of them would catch it.”Among children under the age of five, the infection appears to be spreading the fastest, with 40% of those who test positive requiring hospital care. Dr Naveed Syad said that with the rise in cases coming in the wake of the pandemic, which ""has stirred up a lot if issues"".“Some of it goes back to the now debunked claims between MMR and autism, which isn't there,"" he said.“Some of the communities are still holding onto that sort of fake news around that.  ""It's a challenge to try and overturn some of those myths, which have become more embedded in some communities.”Measles vaccinations were introduced in the UK in 1968 and are estimated to have prevented 20 million cases and 4,500 deaths.The MMR jab, itself introduced nearly 30 years ago, is part of the routine NHS schedule of childhood vaccines. It is given in two doses, the first before age two and the second before age five.

James Atkinson, died from a peanut allergy after eating chicken tikka masala pizza from Dadyal in Newcastle, on 10 July 2020. A hearing has been told the restaurant's menus did not mention the dish contained peanut powder. There is no evidence to suggest the 23-year-old told staff about his allergy. The computer programmer,  who was originally from Leeds, had ordered a pizza from Dadyal via the Deliveroo app, but after eating less than a slice he immediately became unwell. The inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre heard that the Newcastle University graduate, who was living with flatmates in Jesmond, died at the city's Royal Victoria Infirmary under an hour. The cause of Mr Atkinson's death was anaphylaxis, caused by eating peanuts in the curry, the inquest has heard. The inquest previously heard that Mr Atkinson had used Google to find out if chicken tikka masala contained peanuts, but he did not call the restaurant to inform them of his allergy. On Friday, the hearing was told that the restaurant's menus mentioned coconut, almond and cashew in the ingredients of its chicken tikka masala, but not the peanut powder it actually contained. Gulfam Ulhaq, 58, who ran the restaurant for his brother who owned it, said it was up to customers to tell staff if they had an allergy. Speaking through an interpreter, he told the inquest: ""They could lose their life. ""It is the responsibility of the person who has the allergy to mention it,"" he added. At the end of his evidence, Mr Ulhaq addressed Mr Atkinson's family to express his condolences at the loss of their son. Dadyal restaurant in Howard Street has been closed for about two years.

They are among the almost 1,000 non-directed altruistic kidney donors  in the UK - the term for someone who has donated an organ to someone they have never met.There are currently 75 people in Surrey and 104 in Sussex on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. Paul Vandenbosch, a GP in Woking, donated a kidney in 2008 after a patient told him that receiving a transplant was like ""winning the lottery"". The patient then added: “No, better than that, because no amount of money could have made me feel well again.""Mr Vandenbosch, who is now 69, told BBC Radio Sussex: ""My first job as a junior doctor in hospital in the 70s was on a renal ward and while dialysis was obviously life saving it was also very clear that it was far from an ideal treatment."" Sarah Lovegrove, aged 65 and from Woking, donated her kidney in 2022, inspired by a man she knew who died waiting for a heart transplant, leaving behind a wife and two young children. ""I’ve known people who have received a kidney and I’ve seen what an amazing impact it has on their life – it basically gives them their life back,"" she said. Asked if he was concerned about the impact on his own health, Mr Vandenbosch said the procedure was not high risk. ""Looking back on it, it was amazingly easily,"" he said, adding that he was ""healthier than most people"" in their late sixties and ""still cycling regularly, still working"". Ms Lovegrove said she was not worried about the operation as the medical staff were ""very, very careful"" and ""very kind, helpful and encouraging"". ""They are not going to take your kidney away if they feel that you’re going to suffer for it,"" she said. Asked if he had met the person who received his kidney, Mr Vandenbosch said: ""I don’t think I’m very keen to meet them particularly and I think quite a lot of recipients aren’t necessarily keen to meet their donors.""However, he added that there were ""some very nice records of people who’ve met their donors and formed friendships with them"".

Aged just 18 and living away from home at university, she had never heard of the condition which could affect up to 50% of women during their lifetime. ""I noticed when I went to the toilet a bulge was coming out of my vagina,"" she said. ""I was also experiencing incontinence and pain during intercourse and a bulging feeling. ""I didn't really know what to think because I honestly knew nothing about my body at that time."" Natashja, now 24, says she did not know what her pelvic floor or her cervix were at the time. ""So I asked my friends 'Is this bulging lump sensation normal?',"" she said. ""They said, 'Maybe it's your G-spot. Maybe it's just a spot'."" Natashja, from Greenwich in London, didn't know what to think so she left it and hoped it would go away with time. But her symptoms got worse and after 18 months she finally confided in her mum who persuaded her to see a doctor. It was later confirmed she had uterine prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when the group of muscles and tissues that normally support the pelvic organs, called the pelvic floor, becomes weakened and cannot hold the organs firmly in place. It causes one or more of the organs to move down from their normal position, leading to a bulge that can be felt inside or outside the vagina. This can be the womb, bowel, bladder or top of the vagina. Many women are unaware they have a prolapse or only have mild symptoms, but for some it can have a real impact on their quality of life. Symptoms can include a heavy dragging sensation or feeling of something coming down the vagina - which is sometimes described like a feeling of 'sitting on a tennis ball' as well as bladder and bowel issues and discomfort during sex. Pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle changes can help to improve symptoms, but sometimes medical treatment is needed such as vaginal pessaries or surgery. Causes of prolapse include genetics, heavy lifting, constipation or a persistent cough. Pregnancy and childbirth increase the risk of prolapse, particularly after a difficult labour. Women are also more likely to develop prolapse as they get older, especially after the menopause. But Natashja is keen to make people aware it can affect younger people too. She is trying to lift the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse through social media and her blog 'Living With Prolapse'. ""There's still so much stigma around prolapse, around discussing your genitalia and that doesn't allow for people to go see a doctor,"" she said. ""I know that if there was less stigma I would've gone to a doctor much earlier."" The stories of women hoping to left the stigma around pelvic organ prolapse. Watch now on BBC iPlayer According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) one in 12 women report symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse but on examination it is present in up to 50% of all women. Research yet to be published by Stirling University indicates that embarrassment, lack of awareness and a fear that symptoms won't be taken seriously, all act as barriers to women seeking help for pelvic health problems. The study looked at papers from 24 countries including the UK over the past 20 years, taking in the views of more than 20,000 women. Researchers Clare Jouanny and Dr Purva Abhyankar said: ""There is a large body of evidence from the UK and similar countries across the world that women still face many barriers when it comes to seeking help for women's health issues like prolapse. ""We need to focus not only on increasing awareness and education among women and clinicians, but more importantly we need to work with clinicians to change women's perception that clinicians don't take them seriously with pelvic health symptoms."" Pelvic health physiotherapist Suzanne Vernazza is on a mission to educate women about their pelvic health. She is the founder of the not-for-profit company Know Your Floors and her daily 'SqueezeAlong' pelvic floor exercise tutorials have more than 600,000 followers on TikTok. She says it is important for people to raise pelvic health concerns with their GP. ""If you've been feeling something that at any point doesn't feel quite right, whether you're pregnant or postnatal, raise it and ask the question because more than likely, you're right that it's not right - and you can have support for you to be able to manage that,"" she said. The Royal College of GPs said its doctors are well trained to diagnose and care for people affected by prolapse. RCGP Scotland deputy chairman Dr Chris Williams said: ""GPs are aware of the embarrassment or stigma that can be associated with this condition and strive to ensure women feel comfortable and empowered to seek support if experiencing symptoms."" Sam Hindle experienced bladder prolapse after the birth of her son 24 years ago and has been incontinent ever since. ""It was that bad that my two-year-old son was having to go and fetch mummy clean pants, clean trousers,"" she said.  ""It was embarrassing to have your two-year-old run about and say ' Oh Mummy's had an accident, I need to help'.'"" The 47-year-old, from Edinburgh, was one of tens of thousands of women in the UK to have transvaginal mesh surgery to treat prolapse and incontinence. Its use was halted in the UK in 2018 due to the life-changing side-effects many women suffered. Sam said she had been left in constant pain and suffers from PTSD as a result of the procedure. She hopes to have her mesh removed by a specialist in the United States and is currently on a waiting list for assessment in Glasgow. She said it was important for people to talk about pelvic health. ""Just like menopause, it's a subject that we need to remove the stigma of and talk about and let people not feel embarrassed about this so they will go and seek help,"" she said. ""You look at other females in the family who are having children and you think, 'Oh I'd better warn them, I better make sure they know about pelvic floor exercises and they know how to avoid possibly getting into the mess I did with bladder prolapse."" Natashja said prolapse affects women of all ages and it does not discriminate. ""I noticed my symptoms when I was 18 and when I went on Google it was only telling me that elderly women were impacted,"" she said. ""The doctors were so shocked that someone of my age had prolapse and it made me feel very isolated."" Natashja said she is now feeling positive about the future. She has been working with a pelvic health physiotherapist and uses a vaginal pessary, a device that helps to support the vaginal walls and pelvic organs, which means she feels more confident doing exercise. She said the support and advice of the online community had also helped her to cope. ""If you have just been diagnosed with prolapse, it's important to know you do not have to go through this alone,"" she said. ""There is an army of women out there willing to support you and help you through your journey and they can understand what you're going through and help you through it.""","['Health', ""Women's health"", 'Women']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0B2E/production/_132126820_female_anatomy_2x_640-nc-002.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0253/production/_124659500_generic_banner_top.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/105E8/production/_132084076_index_promo_prolapse.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2BC/production/_124365754_generic_banner_bottom.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15020/production/_132084068_suzannepic1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/69A8/production/_132084072_sampic.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0030/production/_132084000_natasha2.jpg']","['By Hayley Jarvis', 'BBC Scotland reporter']",Health,Health

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-67916152,"Dog attacks: Victims double since pandemic, surgeon says",Surgeons at a plastic surgery unit in West Sussex say they are treating double the number of dog-attack victims since before the pandemic.,2024-01-12,"Surgeons at a plastic surgery unit in West Sussex say they are treating double the number of dog-attack victims since before the pandemic. The number of admissions at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead rose from 116 in 2019 to 237 in 2022. Siva Kumar, a consultant surgeon, said he had seen an increase in the number of bites as dog ownership rose during the pandemic. The government says it is working with police to prevent attacks. This article contains pictures and descriptions of dogs bites that some readers may find upsetting. Mr Kumar, whose trauma clinics treat patients from Kent, Surrey and Sussex, told BBC South East the specialist centre would often see the most severe cases. He said: ""We would get at least one, if not two patients that are dog bites every day. We have seen a doubling in the number of patients that have come through and in the last year we've seen double the number of children that have had dog bites. ""Children are probably the ones that affect you the most. Ones with multiple dog bites with scarring that they will carry through the rest of their lives."" National data from NHS Digital also shows there has been a steady increase in the number of hospital admissions for dog bites over the last 10 years. There were 9,277 in 2022-23, up 47% from 6,317 in 2012-13. There has been a much smaller increase in admissions for under-18s for dog bites, up by 8% to 1,740 in the same time period. Although these figures show a rise in admissions for dog bites, one bite can result in multiple admissions and it may not include all dog bites that resulted in hospital admission. Darren Davies, 53, suffered serious hand injuries in December after intervening when a dog he was walking was attacked by another, near to his home in Staplehurst. ""I didn't even see it,"" he said. ""I had the dog by the back of the neck with two hands, the dog managed to spin round so quickly, and bite me, that I didn't even see him do it, it was just so fast, and he bit me. ""I knew something was really bad. It goes right across the top of my hand."" He was treated at the Queen Victoria Hospital for his injuries. ""It's the worst injury I think I have ever had in my life,"" he added. Kerry Stevens from Eastbourne needed several operations at the Queen Victoria Hospital. She said she was still scarred psychologically after she was attacked by a cross between a pit bull and an American bulldog in 2014. ""I was delivering a package to a property when the dog came running out, knocked me to the floor and locked its jaw on me,"" she said. ""There were bits of my flesh on the floor, it was terrifying, I feared I could have died."" Kerry said that while the scars may heal, she still remembered the attack ""every so often"". ""There should be more muzzling brought into place for dogs that could be like that,"" she added. Last year a BBC investigation found the number of dog attacks recorded by police in England and Wales had risen by more than a third in the previous five years. The government says there have been 23 deaths caused by dog attacks since the start of 2021, with the bully XL breed ""being disproportionately involved in this rise"". The new rules for owning bully XL dogs are being introduced in England and Wales. They must now be kept on a lead and muzzled in public and from 1 February it will be illegal to own one without an exemption certificate. Charities are calling for a complete overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act, including tougher penalties for owners who fail to control their dogs. Dog behaviourist and trainer Pippa Apps from Kent suggested some dogs bought during the pandemic had not been properly socialised and that could be a factor in the number of dog bites. She said: ""The critical period of socialisation is up to four months of age and without socialising with dogs, and experiencing other dogs in a really positive way in that time, they are much less able to cope as well in a social setting as they get older."" A government spokesperson said:  ""We are focused on ensuring that the full range of existing powers to tackle dog control issues are effectively applied across all breeds of dog.

Some say they considered taking their own lives as they struggled to cope with civilian life or severe injury. The NHS is offering hope in the form of an expanded mental health support service tailor-made for military personnel.,2024-01-12,"Military veterans have opened up about the low points they hit after leaving the forces. Some say they considered taking their own lives as they struggled to cope with civilian life or severe injury. The NHS is offering hope in the form of an expanded mental health support service tailor-made for military personnel. Denis Mutisya, 36, served as a Bombardier in the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery for 13 years, before being discharged two years ago due to injury. He said the change was a ""shock"", and not something he had anticipated. At his lowest point he was able to turn to Op Courage, an NHS service aimed at serving and retired members of the armed forces. Former military dental officer, Debbie Cooper, said her encounter with Op Courage was ""the first glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel"". ""I joined up to pretty much do my full career in the military so being told that this is the end of my career was bittersweet,"" said Mr Mutisya. ""I was not physically able to carry on. I understand that, but I did struggle."" As his return to civvy street started becoming ""very difficult"", the veteran connected with Op Courage. ""At the time I wasn't even aware that I was struggling with my mental health,"" he continued. ""That one call - it changed my life. Set up by the NHS in 2017, the ""lifeline"" service Op Courage has seen more than 30,000 referrals with many self-referring veterans looking for help. ""Up to that point, I thought I'd reached the end, but they helped me realise it was just the beginning,"" Mr Mutisya added. Former dental officer for the Royal Air Force, Debbie Cooper, said life after serving was also a ""struggle"". ""Everywhere I turned, no one really understood,"" said the 55-year-old veteran. ""Ultimately, I found myself in hospital after trying to end my life - I had lost all hope"" she added. ""I was aware I needed help, and I tried, but it wasn't easy."" The turning point came when the Ms Cooper was searching for support online and came across Op Courage. ""It was the first glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said. ""Talking to them was a breath of fresh air - I felt like someone was finally listening and responding in a way that was helpful. ""They got where I was coming from and understood my experiences. ""It finally felt like someone cared,"" she added. The NHS is hoping its revamped scheme- which now includes addiction support - will attract more self-referrals for veterans grappling with their mental health. Dr Jonathan Leach, NHS England medical director for military and veterans' health, said staff were either ex-military or knew the ""military culture first-hand"". ""This sets them up to provide a non-judgemental service and build trust with those seeking help,"" he said.Johnny Mercer, Minister of State for Veterans' Affairs, urged anyone struggling ""to reach out"". ""I am determined to make this the best country in the world to be a veteran, but to do that we need veterans and the public to be aware of what support is already available to them,"" Mr Mercer said. Former Royal Marine, Invictus Games medallist and TV presenter JJ Chalmers, said having a service ""developed by veterans, for veterans"" was ""invaluable"". ""I remember how hard it was adjusting to life after the military, getting to grips with civvy street after everything I went through in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""I was wounded in service and I was literally broken from head-to-toe and that had its physical challenges, it had its mental challenges."" He added it can be ""so difficult"" asking for help and support ""when you need it most"". ""Recognising when you need to reach out is the first hurdle and fellow veterans can help so much with this, as they've been through it too,"" he said. ""They really get where you've come from,"" he added. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Healthwatch Suffolk surveyed 13,000 people aged between 11 and 19 - and up to 25 years for those with special educational needs or disabilities. The findings are part of an overall state of young people in the county. Chief executive Andy Yacoub said: ""There needs to be [not only] a whole school approach, but a whole system approach too"". The survey has been conducted for the last eight years alongside other professional groups and student bodies. It found an ""upturn"" in well-being for the first time since the pandemic, but still revealed ""cause for concern"". The survey showed that more than 2,100 young people had seen the ""sharing of images or videos of other students of a sexual nature"". Almost 3,900 had seen or heard people using homophobic language - and 1,768 had seen other ""unwanted sexual behaviour"". Mr Yacoub added: ""Because there are so many respondents, it really is difficult to ignore. ""There is a prevalence of peer on peer sexual harassment, and sexual violence, including online."" Fiona Ellis, the chief executive of Survivors in Transition, who were involved with the survey, said: ""We have seen the numbers of young people needing support around sexual violence, especially peer on peer abuse and harassment increasing year on year at alarming rates. ""Sadly, for many young women in particular, this is becoming a cultural norm, as was reported in Ofsted's 2021 rapid review of sexual abuse in schools. The survey also gauged the state of young people's well-being, including worries regarding the cost of living crisis and optimism for their future.

Dimple Bhatia, who has run Tollesbury Pharmacy, in Maldon, for 15 years, warned more businesses would not survive the mounting pressures. NHS data showed 21 pharmacies closed their doors in Essex between September 2016 and November 2023. The Department of Health and Social Care said it would provide £645m to the sector in additional funding. Mr Bhatia said 90% of his revenue came from the NHS, but while its funding for prescription medicines was falling, the prices he could dispense at were fixed. The pharmacist, who said he dealt with in excess of 400 prescriptions a day, called on the government to help save venues like his. ""I have never known a situation so bad in the 27 years I've been working as a pharmacist,"" he told BBC Essex. ""The way things are going, if they don't change, then we are under a lot of pressure."" ""It's hitting the big operators. It's only so long before smaller pharmacies are going to feel the pinch and say 'enough is enough, we can't physically survive'."" Mr Bhatia said if he closed down there would be a ""tremendous"" impact on the community he served, with the nearest alternative pharmacy located six miles away. ""The government needs to recognise that pharmacies provide a pivotal and valuable service. They need to back that up with a cash injection,"" he added. Last year the government launched the Pharmacy First scheme, which allowed pharmacists to supply some prescription medication without the need to visit a GP. It claimed the initiative would ease pressure on doctors. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said it would provide ""thousands more training places for pharmacists"" and had announced £645m in funding to support community pharmacies. The spokesman added that pharmacists ""play a vital role in our healthcare system"". Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67951158,Why parents are reliving their baby-loss nightmares,"A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) got under way this week into the deaths of three babies, all less than a day old, in Lanarkshire.",2024-01-12,"A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) got under way this week into the deaths of three babies, all less than a day old, in Lanarkshire. The death of a baby is an event no parent should endure, let alone in circumstances where - if there were different decisions, procedures, or knowledge - that baby may have survived. To then have the details of that personal tragedy made public is further trauma that no family would want. Mirabelle Bosch died at just 12 hours old on 2 July 2021 at Wishaw General Hospital. Ellie McCormick died at five hours old on 5 March 2019 at the same hospital. And Leo Lamont was two hours old when he died at Monklands Hospital on 15 February 2019. It is important that these deaths are not brushed off as isolated tragedies, and if there are common failings then they should be investigated to prevent anything like this from happening again. That is why three families who were anticipating a joyous turn in their lives are putting themselves through the distress of reliving their worst nightmare. This FAI was called by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service which has deemed it in the public interest for this inquiry to take place. Mirabelle, Leo and Ellie were all said to have died ""in circumstances giving rise to serious public concern"". The purpose of this FAI is not to apportion blame, but to establish what happened and prevent future deaths from happening in similar circumstances. A sheriff will hear evidence, and eventually issue a determination of their findings which can include recommendations. Sheriff Principle Aisha Anwar, who is leading this inquiry, is sensitive to the immense trauma suffered by each family. While there is no way to avoid the distressing detail of what happened, much of their evidence has been submitted as written affidavits to save them the ordeal of being questioned on it in court. All the parents were in court on the first day of the inquiry, but none have been there since. Although very little is known at this stage, it is clear that a key question families want answered is how and whether potential procedural or system errors contributed to their babies deaths. The inquiry is set out in three chapters, firstly looking at the circumstances around Mirabelle Bosch's death. Her father Eckhardt, told the inquiry they were ""led into a dark tunnel"" by ""misguided"" instructions which gave them a ""wrong sense of security"". They had believed everything with the pregnancy was normal, with antenatal checks suggesting the baby was healthy and developing as it should. But the court heard that despite a 31-week scan recording the baby as completely breech, three subsequent midwife examinations recorded it as being in a head down, cephalic position. This is the position that typically allows for the smoothest delivery. Even when Rozelle Bosch's waters broke suddenly on 30 June 2021 and she was examined in hospital, the midwife sent her home to wait for labour to advance. Mirabelle was considered a ""low-risk"" pregnancy and midwife Michelle Tannahill told the inquiry this week she saw ""no red flags"" upon her examination. ""Everything I had found that night was within the scope of my practice within midwifery. There wasn't anything concerning,"" she said. The details of what happened next are extremely distressing. Husband Eckhardt Bosch said he still feels the trauma in his body over the night of 1 July. After going into active labour at home, paramedics were called but a catalogue of delays ensued. It took five attempts to call the maternity unit at Wishaw General Hospital before anybody answered the phone, and paramedics were unable to deliver the baby themselves. Mirabelle's head was stuck and by the time mother and baby were taken to hospital, her chances of survival were very slim. She died hours later in her mother's arms. The post-mortem later noted that if the breech position had been recognised earlier in the pregnancy, then Rozelle would have likely been classified as a higher risk where a management plan for a hospital birth would have been arranged and the outcome may have been different. The pathologist also concluded if there had not been such a long delays transporting the patient to hospital, she may also have stood a chance of survival. Evidence has been heard from health professionals involved in Mirabelle's death, with expert witnesses who were not directly involved in the case to follow. The FAI will then examine the deaths of Ellie McCormick and Leo Lamont. At this point there is no indication that health professionals in Mirabelle's case had not followed the protocols or procedures in place at the time. However, there have been questions about whether software used to record details of the pregnancy may not have alerted those involved of potential risks, or may have some limitations in the information it can hold. Issues around the subjectivity of deciding whether a baby is engaged in early pregnancy, and how clear instructions are to mothers on when they come into hospital, have also been discussed. These areas are likely to be explored further when the inquiry examines the circumstances around the deaths of Leo and Ellie. Speaking to BBC Scotland News, the McCormick family lawyer said they believe Ellie's death was entirely avoidable. Darren Deery, a specialist in medical negligence law, said: ""The family's understanding is that there were potential defects in the system, in that certain risk factors weren't highlighted in the way they could, and should, have been. ""And had the subsequent midwifery and obstetrics staff been aware of those risks, a different course of action would have been taken and the outcome may well have been different."" Ultimately there will be no blame placed here, but it will look in detail at what happened in each case, considering whether systems were at fault, whether individual or collective errors were involved and it will establish what steps, if any, might be taken to prevent other children dying in similar circumstances.","['NHS Lanarkshire', 'Wishaw', 'Pregnancy']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15301/production/_132258768_gettyimages-640974708.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9399/production/_132258773_spin-babiesfaiglasgowsheriff-002.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D49C/production/_132282445_faibabyrantwithdepartures.1_frame_1057.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1BC2/production/_132260170_faibabydeathlawyer_frame_3989.jpg']","['By Lisa Summers', 'Scotland Health Correspondent']",Health,Health

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it had serious concerns that elderly residents at Ryland Residential Home, in Beeston, were not being properly cared for and were at risk of harm. It said the home would be kept under close review after it published its latest inspection report on Friday. The home has been contacted for comment. CQC officials carried out the inspection in October after they were informed of concerns about how medicines were managed, staffing levels and safety at the home. Greg Reilly, CQC deputy director of operations in the Midlands, said: ""When we inspected Ryland Residential Home, we found a home where leaders didn't have a good understanding of the issues it faced which had resulted in a poor standard of care being provided. ""We found serious concerns regarding people's needs not being met that leaders must urgently address to prevent people from being harmed."" Mr Reilly said it was unacceptable that some residents had been injured in falls because the home was unsafe. He said unfixed threshold strips in doorways and carpets presented a tripping hazard and when people had falls, staff did not complete the necessary checks or take action to prevent it happening again. The CQC found some hazardous items, like disinfectant, were accessible to residents and staff had not always properly supported people with mental health problems. A further inspection is planned and the CQC warned enforcement action could follow if improvements are not made. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Developers have submitted plans to the local authority to convert the Bridge House Dental Surgery in Durham into eight purpose-built student apartments.But the plans have been met with fierce opposition from local politicians. The firm which runs the dentist said they are currently looking for a new location for the practice. The proposal has been submitted by Hugo Wilkie-Smith, who the BBC have been unable to make contact with.Durham City Labour MP Mary Kelly Foy said: “Over the last year, hundreds of constituents have contacted me about their difficulties in accessing a dentist, and this application will do nothing to make this easier.“Durham was already in danger of becoming a ‘dental desert’ and it’s unacceptable that a vital service for the city will be lost for the sake of a studio development which in some cases won’t even meet the minimum acceptable space standards.”A recent report by Healthwatch County Durham found that 83% of dentists across County Durham were not accepting new NHS patients, external. “It is clearer than ever that more needs to be done to stop the decay of NHS dentistry,” Ms Foy added. Durham City Parish Council also warned the loss of such a facility would likely exacerbate the challenges for patients accessing dentistry services in the area. The parish council said: “The fact that this proposal would remove a much-needed primary healthcare provision for our city and offers no alternative provision at all will be deeply troubling for patients.” A spokesperson from Mydentist, which runs the dental surgery, said they wanted to reassure patients regarding the plans. They said: “We would like to reassure patients that although we may be moving practice location this year we are committed to continuing to provide dental care to the local community.”They added that they are currently looking for a new location and that they will keep patients updated. The latest proposal is the final phase of the redevelopment of the Bridge House building, which has taken place over the past seven years by Ridley Properties, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.The planning application is due to be considered by Durham County Council later this year.

Garden House Hospice Care in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, wanted to reduce the time patients spent in hospital and prevent stays altogether. The hospice has financed it through a £300,000 fundraising campaign. One of the first patients, Connie Yearley, 86, said it was ""an excellent idea"". Hospices traditionally help patients towards the end of their lives. However, the new service helps those living with long-term conditions that need medication, patients who have had falls, and helps people with urinary tract infections or who need care after becoming ill. Mrs Yearley, who used to be a midwife, was transferred from The Lister Hospital in Stevenage after contracting bacterial pneumonia. She is also on the waiting list for hernia repair. ""I've lost mobility and muscle tone, and getting back on my feet doing normal things is going to be a great help,"" she said. If it can attract funding, the hospice hopes to provide ongoing appointments to manage patients, reducing the need for GP visits. Mrs Yearley said it was ""very, very difficult to get a GP appointment"". She revealed ""she would sooner die than go to A&E again"" after a nine-hour wait on a separate occasion last year for a blocked stoma. In partnership with Lister Hospital, nurses from Garden House visit frailty wards and the emergency department every weekday to pick out patients to safely transfer to hospice beds. Garden House has a team of occupational therapists and physiotherapists for rehabilitation, but another patient, 81-year-old Robert King, said more should be done within the NHS to help patients. ""Years ago people would never go straight home - they'd go to a nursing home to rehabilitate. Somehow that's all disappeared."" He believed more ideas like this would ""give the NHS a better chance"". But a report by the County Councils network said that employing more physiotherapists to help the frail become mobile in their own homes was just as important as beds. Donations will fund Garden House's service until April. Health officials in Hertfordshire and west Essex said population data predicted in the 25 years up to 2043 there would be a 73% increase in people aged over 85. The local Integrated Care Board oversees healthcare. One of its clinical managers, Dr Mark Andrews, described the statistic as ""quite worrying"". He said: ""This older population with long-term conditions is going to need a lot more support."" When asked why the NHS was not funding the hospice scheme, he said the system was under ""huge financial pressure"". The hospice also runs weekly exercise groups, using them to identify those needing help. Irene Park, 87, said: ""I came here this morning and someone said 'you look really well' - it's because we come here. There's a guy here who's 100 and he can do more than I can."" Pat Lade, 85, who is recovering from a mini stroke, added: ""It gets me out, because I live on my own. ""You sit in a chair all day and you just stiffen up. It is important to keep yourself going, as I don't want to end up in a home or hospital."" Hospice chief executive Lisa Hunt believed there were thousands of local patients with long-term conditions who visited hospital about 15 times a year. ""By the age of 60, some of us can have as many as eight health conditions, including asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or heart failure, and often they do not know where to turn,"" she said. ""It is therefore an inevitable side-effect of a system where people with frailty are not being supported, that it's the frail often blamed for bed-blocking and filling up A&E every winter."" Garden House is the first hospice to provide a specific frailty service incorporating inpatient beds, exercise groups and ongoing care. The Hospice UK charity said frailty was a cause of death in older people, and those people were less likely to be helped by hospices than advanced cancer patients. It has been running smaller pilot projects across England to change that. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

But a floodlight? That's what Max Mckeown chose when he went under the needle. As you might expect, the inked tribute permanently etched on the 23-year-old's calf isn't just any old floodlight. It's the 150ft (45m) tall giant that sits at the north-eastern corner of Swansea Rugby Club's St Helens stadium. According to local legend, it's the tallest freestanding floodlight in Europe. And Max, who lives in Cardiff, says his love affair with the leviathan lantern started when it saved him on the way back to a mate's from a night out. He says he'd found himself lost and alone in Swansea with no phone, and made the ""rather silly decision"" to get back by himself despite not knowing the area. Then he remembered his destination was right next to the rugby club. ""I kept on wandering around until eventually towering above all the houses, much like the North Star, I saw the big light of St Helens ground,"" he says. ""Like the wise men to Bethlehem, it guided me home."" From then on, according to Max, the light became ""a bit of a personality trait"", one that he even made a key feature of his dating profile at the time. ""My girlfriend ended up swiping right on it and we've been dating for two-and-half years,"" he says. But while the light story became a useful icebreaker at parties, Max says he realised it might be time to ""put the joke to bed"" when his Instagram was ""pretty much filled with wall-to-wall lights content"". ""Frankly, I was bored of it,"" he says. ""I thought 'I need a punchline. I need a conclusion'. ""And what better punchline or conclusion than just to get it on me permanently?"" Max says he's ""not a fan of tattoos"" but decided to get the black-and-white design, showing the floodlight looming over rooftops inked in 2021. His decision was partly down to the impressive claim that the structure is ""Europe's tallest freestanding light"". But is that actually true? According to David Dow from Swansea RFC, the height would have been hard to beat when it was first erected in 1964. ""Whether this claim still stands is debatable, but it is possible because most newer floodlights do not emanate from a freestanding tower,"" he told Newsbeat. So, what will Max do if it turns out the light isn't quite the record-breaker he thought it was? He says: ""I'll probably get a tattoo on the other leg with a footnote, an asterisk or something that says 'one of the tallest'."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter.
