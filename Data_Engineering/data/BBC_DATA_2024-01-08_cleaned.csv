https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67905566,Al Jazeera bureau chief's son Hamza al-Dahdouh among journalists killed in Gaza,The eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief has been killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza.,2024-01-08,"The eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief has been killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza. Hamza al-Dahdouh, an Al Jazeera network journalist and cameraman, was driving in a car with other journalists along a road between Khan Younis and Rafah on Sunday when it was hit. Freelance journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed. A third journalist, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured. Four other members of bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh's family have been killed. His wife Amna, his grandchild Adam, his 15-year-old son Mahmoud and seven-year-old daughter Sham were killed in an Israeli strike in Nuseirat refugee camp in October. According to Al Jazeera correspondent Hisham Zaqout, Hamza al-Dahdouh and a group of journalists were en route to the Moraj area north-east of Rafah - which was designated a ""humanitarian zone"" by the Israeli army - but which had reportedly experienced recent bombings. Many displaced Gazans had fled to the area to escape the bombardment in other regions of the territory. Hamza had intended to report on the unfolding situation and the aftermath of the bombings in the area, according to Al Jazeera. In a statement to the BBC, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""An IDF aircraft identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops. ""We are aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit."" Live footage from Al Jazeera showed the aftermath of the strike on the car they had been travelling in. It also showed his father Wael al-Dahdouh in tears, holding his hand and standing next to his body in a morgue in Khan Younis. He was buried in the southern city of Rafah. ""Hamza was not just part of me. He was the whole of me. He was the soul of my soul. These are tears of sadness, of loss. These are tears of humanity,"" his father said at the funeral. ""I call on the world to look closely at what's happening in Gaza."" Wael al-Dahdouh was himself wounded and his cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa was killed in a separate strike while filming last month. Mr al-Dahdouh, who has eight children, continued reporting on the war in Gaza. Hamza al-Dahdouh had one million followers on Instagram. His final post before he was killed was about his father. ""You are steadfast and patient. Do not despair of God's mercy. Be certain that he will reward you,"" he said. The Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement that it ""strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces' targeting of Palestinian journalists' car"". ""The assassination of Mustafa and Hamza... whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty in the Gaza Strip, reaffirms the need to take immediate necessary legal measures against the occupation forces to ensure that there is no impunity,"" it added. It also alleged that the strike ""confirms without a doubt the Israeli forces' determination continue these brutal attacks against journalists and their families, aiming to discourage them from performing their mission, violating the principles of freedom of the press and undermines the right to life"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Hamza al-Dahdouh's death was ""an unimaginable tragedy"". He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the BBC's World This Weekend that ""Israel does not deliberately target journalists"". ""We're the only country in the Middle East that actually does have a free press. We're the only country in the entire region where the press can write bad things and criticise the leaders of government,"" he said. ""To say Israel deliberately targets the press is ridiculous, we're the only country that actually enshrines the free press."" More than 75 journalists have been killed since the war in Gaza started. More than 22,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Journalism', 'Israel']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1144C/production/_132223707_adsz.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11D52/production/_132224037_1f03380cd94ef2d723ab6cdb0c7c5106b848e362.jpg']",['Shaimaa Khalil'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67907336,Palestinians must be able to stay in Gaza - Blinken,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow.",2024-01-08,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow. Mr Blinken condemned statements by some Israeli ministers, who called for the resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere. The US official was in Qatar on his latest Middle East tour. His comments followed reports that up to 70 people were killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. Footage from Jabalia showed bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building - many of them women and children. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it ""acted against a military target in the strike"" and that it was ""not aware of the number of casualties mentioned"". ""In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,"" they said, adding that the IDF ""follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"". More than 60 Palestinians were reportedly also killed in the past day in the southern city of Khan Younis. Jabalia camp has been struck many times since Israel began its war against Hamas following the unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October. Some 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage in the Hamas raids. More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has reported at least 113 deaths over 24 hours of Israeli bombardment. ""Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,"" Mr Blinken said on Sunday. ""They cannot, they must not be pressed to leave Gaza."" Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"". And National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right politician, this week issued a call ""to encourage the migration of Gaza residents"" as a ""solution"" to the crisis. The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Health officials said even medical facilities including hospitals are now unsafe. Three international medical aid groups announced they were pulling out of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza after Israel issued evacuation orders. A representative of the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that they were ""hugely concerned by this development"". ""What it means is that a hospital that was already over-crowded and overloaded and well beyond its capacity is now without absolutely critical reinforcement to support it as it deals with an ever-increasing number of casualties,"" said Gemma Connell. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that more than 600 patients and health workers were forced to leave the hospital, according to its director. ""Their locations are not currently known,"" said Mr Tedros in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Mr Blinken's latest trip to the Middle East comes amid rising tensions in the region, with concerns that the war in Gaza could spread. Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas official, was assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement in Lebanon, described Arouri's assassination as a ""flagrant Israeli aggression"" that would not go unpunished. Hezbollah then fired rockets into Israel on Saturday as a ""preliminary response"" to the killing of Arouri. ""This is a moment of profound tension in the region. This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Mr Blinken said. Qatar's PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al -Thani said that the killing of Arouri had affected ""the complicated process"". Mr Blinken also said that the death of journalist Hamza al-Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza., was ""an unimaginable tragedy"". He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war. Mr Blinken arrived in Qatar following stops in Jordan, Turkey and Greece. He went on to Abu Dhabi late Sunday, and on Monday is due to travel to Saudi Arabia.","['Israel & the Palestinians', 'Antony Blinken', 'Hezbollah', 'Gaza', 'Israel-Gaza war', 'Hamas', 'Palestinian territories', 'Israel', 'Middle East']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16F00/production/_132225939_mediaitem132225938.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/60B8/production/_132206742_mediaitem132205151.jpg']",['George Wright'],Israel-Gaza war,Israel-Gaza war
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-62134399,How does the new Wales-wide 20mph speed limit law work?,Motorists in Wales now have to limit their speed to 20mph in built-up areas such as village and town centres.,2024-01-08,"Motorists in Wales now have to limit their speed to 20mph in built-up areas such as village and town centres. In 2022, the Senedd voted to make Wales the first nation in the UK to adopt 20mph as the default speed limit on restricted roads. It started on 17 September, and has proved controversial - but how does it work? Here we try our best to answer your queries. The 20mph limit has come into force for all restricted roads, which are defined as roads with lampposts placed not more than 200 yards (about 180m) apart. They are typically located in residential and built-up areas of high pedestrian activity. The 20mph limit began on 17 September 2023. The new law to make Wales the first nation to impose 20mph as the default on all restricted roads was passed by the Welsh Parliament in July 2022. The proposal was given the go-ahead by 39 votes to 15, after initial backing in the Senedd two years previously. The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 said it was not lawful to drive a on a restricted road at more than 30mph. That was later amended to 20mph. Enforcement began on 8 January, 2024, and roadside teams will use speed monitoring equipment to catch offending motorists. If you are pulled over doing more than 20mph in a built-up area in Wales you could, in theory, be fined a minimum £100 and get three penalty points. But police said their response will be proportionate and reasonable while drivers get used to the change as the focus for the first 12 months will be on education - as officers have a level of discretion. ""Where we find people driving above 20mph, we will stop drivers and speak to them about the dangers and risks about driving above the speed limit,"" said South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis. ""We won't be taking enforcement action against those people who are actually engaging with us and trying to bring their speed down - so they won't receive a fine. ""The people who will be fined will be those driving at the highest levels. Ultimately, if necessary, we will enforce - but that is always a last resort for us."" While police officers across Wales will initially be advised to use ""discretion"", all drivers will be fined if they are caught by a fixed speed camera. Receiving 12 or more points within three years may disqualify you from driving. If you are caught by a camera, depending on the speed, you will be sent an option for a speed awareness course, a fixed penalty notice or a letter telling you to go to court. If you are stopped by the police they can give you a verbal warning, send you a fixed penalty notice, offer a speed awareness course or order you to go to court. Instead of fines, speeding drivers will be offered the chance to watch a video about the dangers of speeding and the benefits of slowing down. Welsh government minister Lee Waters said there will be an ""education led"" approach to enforcement, as ""there's no incentive for us to fine because the money won't stay in Wales"". ""Police guidelines say enforcement will be targeted on drivers travelling 10% above the speed limit - plus 2mph,"" he said. ""For now this will be increased to 10% plus 4mph meaning we start to prosecute at 26mph in a 20mph limit."" As Mr Waters alluded to, the money collected from speeding fines in Wales goes to the UK government. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The money generated by 20mph speeding fines, as with all speeding fines, is directed to HM Treasury."" Speed limits in the Road Traffic Regulations and the Highway Code apply to motor vehicles only, and not to bicycles. But the Highway Code does state that cyclists should be considerate of other road users. The Welsh government has acknowledged the new lower limit is not appropriate everywhere and has said local authorities can make exceptions, though not outside schools. For example, Flintshire council identified 15 roads that could be exempt from the new policy. The Welsh government has produced an interactive map showing the status of current and proposed exemptions to the 20mph speed limit. There has been a pilot scheme running in eight areas of Wales since 2021. They are St Dogmaels in Pembrokeshire, St Brides Major in the Vale of Glamorgan, Llanelli (north), Buckley in Flintshire, Cardiff (north), Cilfrew in Neath Porth Talbot, Abergavenny and Severnside (Caerwent, Caldicot, Magor and Undy) in Monmouthshire. Interim data shows the number of drivers complying with the 20mph speed limit rose from 45% at the start of the trial to 64%. Many areas of London now have 20mph as the default speed for residential roads, while Scotland plans to follow Wales' lead and make the policy nationwide by 2025. Many cities and towns across the UK now have 20mph zones as the norm for residential areas even if the local authority does not have a blanket policy across the whole area. The cost of bringing it in has been estimated at £33m. The Welsh Government said the £32.5m price tag was ""outweighed"" by reduced impact on the NHS and emergency services, which one study said could save £92m a year. The Welsh government said the direct financial cost of the policy falls ""almost entirely"" on its shoulders, and it is funding the capital works carried out by the local authorities through grants. Latest police data from 2022 showed just over half - 51% - of the 4,442 people hurt in collisions in Wales happened on 30mph roads and in 23% of them, someone was killed or seriously injured. The total number of injuries fell by 23.5% compared to 2019. Campaigners argue the chances of someone surviving being hit by a car at 20mph rather than 30mph is seven times higher while stopping distances are almost halved. Ministers in the Senedd have been promoting sustainable travel - such as cycling or walking - after Wales declared a climate emergency in 2019 and aims to become carbon net zero by 2050. They think a lower limit might encourage a change in behaviour.","['Climate', 'Welsh government', 'Environment', 'Motoring', 'Road safety', 'Wales', 'Transport']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F697/production/_125872136_driving1gettyimages-660356594.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D752/production/_102022155_mediaitem102022154.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/101E3/production/_131091066_police_get.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/DD10/production/_125829565_bbc.graphic.png']","['Nicola Bryan', 'Natalie Grice']",Climate,Climate Change
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67911057,Ethiopia-Somaliland deal makes waves in Horn of Africa,The defence minister of the self-declared republic of Somaliland has become the latest casualty of the row over a controversial agreement that is causing ructions in the Horn of Africa.,2024-01-08,"The defence minister of the self-declared republic of Somaliland has become the latest casualty of the row over a controversial agreement that is causing ructions in the Horn of Africa. Abdiqani Mohamoud Ateye resigned saying that cabinet ministers should have been consulted over a deal that Somaliland struck with Ethiopia that could see it leasing part of its coastline to its landlocked neighbour. Somalia - which considers Somaliland to be part of its territory - reacted angrily to the 1 January deal, calling it an act of aggression. Both the US and the African Union have backed the territorial integrity of Somalia and urged all parties to cool tensions. The exact wording of the deal signed by the leaders of Ethiopia and Somalia has not been made public, which is a problem as there are differing versions of what the two sides agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). An MoU is a statement of intent rather than a legally binding agreement but what seems clear is that Somaliland is ready to grant Ethiopia access to the sea for commercial traffic through a port, although it is not clear which port that would be. There is also a military aspect. Somaliland has said it could lease a section of the coast to Ethiopia's navy, which has been confirmed by Addis Ababa. In return, Somaliland will get a share in Ethiopia Airlines, the country's successful national carrier. But where things get sticky is whether Ethiopia said it would recognise Somaliland as an independent state - something which no other country has done in the 30 years since the former British colony said it was leaving Somalia. On the day of the signing, Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi said the agreement included a section stating that Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland as an independent country at some point in the future. Ethiopia has not confirmed this. Instead, in its attempt to clarify what was in the MoU, the government on 3 January said the deal included ""provisions… to make an in-depth assessment towards taking a position regarding the efforts of Somaliland to gain recognition"". For Somalia, Somaliland is an integral part of its territory. Any suggestion that it could make a deal with another country or that bits of it could be leased without the approval of Mogadishu is highly problematic. The day after the MoU was signed, Somalia described the deal as an act of ""aggression"" that was an ""impediment to… peace and stability"". It also recalled its ambassador from Addis Ababa. On Sunday, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud stepped up the rhetoric saying: ""We will defend our country, we will defend it by all means necessary and seek the support of any ally willing to help us."" He also called on youths ""to prepare for the defence of our country"". Last week there were protests in Mogadishu against the deal with tens of thousands turning up to express their opposition. Somaliland, a former British protectorate, declared itself independent from Somalia in 1991 and has all the trappings of a country, including a working political system, regular elections, a police force and its own currency. Over the decades it has also escaped much of the chaos and violence that have hit Somalia. But its independence has not been recognised by any country. If, as Somaliland said, Ethiopia has agreed to recognise it at some point, it would have a profound impact on the Horn of Africa region. Prime Minister Abiy last year described access to the sea as an existential issue. Ethiopia lost its ports when Eritrea seceded in the early 1990s. With more than 100 million people, it is the most populous landlocked country in the world. Mr Abiy's statement raised fears that Ethiopia could try to achieve its goal by force. It has described the deal with Somaliland as historic, and emphasised that its intentions are peaceful. ""The position announced by the government is strongly rooted in a desire to not engage in war with anyone,"" Ethiopia's communications office said. But in an oblique reference to the controversy, Mr Abiy said on X on Sunday that ""if we expect things to happen in ways that we are used to or know or can predict, [opportunities] may pass us"". He added that some sometimes ""out of the box"" thinking was needed to achieve goals. On 3 January, African Union commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat called for calm and mutual respect ""to de-escalate the simmering tension"" between Ethiopia and Somalia. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller also said that his country was concerned by reports that Ethiopia would recognise Somaliland's independence. ""We join other partners in expressing our serious concern as well about the resulting spike in tensions in the Horn of Africa,"" he added in a press briefing. Turkey, which plays a significant role in Somalia, stated its ""commitment to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity"" of Somalia. And Egypt has also pledged support for Somalia. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi told his Somali counterpart that Egypt stood by Somalia and supported ""its security and stability"".","['Somalia', 'Somaliland', 'Ethiopia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6D44/production/_132227972_dba3b51e80e026e1ed7e924b84dba457e2cc0ebc8_78_4018_22611000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png']",['Damian Zane'],World,Africa
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67914673,Betta Edu: Nigerian poverty minister suspended over money in personal bank account,"Nigeria's president has suspended a minister over the alleged diversion of more than 585 million naira ($640,000: £500,000) of public money into a personal bank account.",2024-01-08,"Nigeria's president has suspended a minister over the alleged diversion of more than 585 million naira ($640,000: £500,000) of public money into a personal bank account. Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation Minister Betta Edu was suspended on Monday following public outrage over the scandal. A statement from President Bola Tinubu's office said he had ordered an investigation into Dr Edu's ministry. Dr Edu has denied any wrongdoing. Her office said she had approved the transfer into a personal account, which was not in her name, but said it was for the ""implementation of grants to vulnerable groups"". Dr Edu, 37, is the youngest minister in President Tinubu's cabinet and is seen as a close ally of the president. The suspension of a minister is a rare occurrence in Nigeria - Dr Edu is the first to lose their job since President Tinubu took office in May last year. His predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, sacked only two ministers during his eight-year tenure. Last week, local media reported on a leaked document that allegedly showed Dr Edu instructing a senior treasury official to transfer the money to the personal account of Bridget Oniyelu, the accountant for the government's Grants for Vulnerable Groups initiative. Reports that Dr Edu had asked for the funds be moved to a personal account, rather than a government one, caused outrage. Mr Tinubu called for an investigation into the transfer on Sunday. He asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for a ""thorough investigation into all aspects of the financial transactions involving the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation,"" said a statement released on Monday. Mr Tinubu asked Dr Edu to comply with the investigation. He also called for the reform of government institutions that run National Social Investments Programmes (NSIP) - initiatives like the Grant for Vulnerable Groups that aim to tackle poverty - stressing a need to ""win back lost public confidence"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67749215,"TB Joshua: Megachurch leader raped and tortured worshippers, BBC finds",Evidence of widespread abuse and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical churches has been uncovered by the BBC.,2024-01-08,"Evidence of widespread abuse and torture by the founder of one of the world's biggest Christian evangelical churches has been uncovered by the BBC. Dozens of ex-Synagogue Church of all Nations members - five British - allege atrocities, including rape and forced abortions, by Nigeria's late TB Joshua. The allegations of abuse in a secretive Lagos compound span almost 20 years. The Synagogue Church of All Nations did not respond to the allegations but said previous claims have been unfounded. TB Joshua, who died in 2021, was a charismatic and hugely successful preacher and televangelist who had an immense global following. The BBC's findings over a two-year investigation include: One of the victims, a British woman, called Rae, was 21 years old when she abandoned her degree at Brighton University in 2002 and was recruited into the church. She spent the next 12 years as one of Joshua's so-called ""disciples"" inside his maze-like concrete compound in Lagos. Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside UK) ""We all thought we were in heaven, but we were in hell, and in hell terrible things happen,"" she told the BBC. Rae says she was sexually assaulted by Joshua and subjected to a form of solitary confinement for two years. The abuse was so severe, she says she attempted suicide multiple times inside the compound. The Synagogue Church of All Nations [Scoan] has a global following, operating a Christian TV channel called Emmanuel TV and social media networks with millions of viewers. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, tens of thousands of pilgrims from Europe, the Americas, South East Asia and Africa travelled to the church in Nigeria to witness Joshua performing ""healing miracles"". At least 150 visitors lived with him as disciples inside his compound in Lagos, sometimes for decades. More than 25 former ""disciples"" spoke to the BBC - from the UK, Nigeria, US, South Africa, Ghana, Namibia and Germany - giving powerful corroborating testimony about their experiences within the church, with the most recent experiences in 2019. Many victims were in their teens when they first joined. In some of the British cases, their transport to Lagos was paid for by Joshua, in co-ordination with other UK churches. Rae and multiple other interviewees compared their experiences to being in a cult. Jessica Kaimu, from Namibia, says her ordeal lasted more than five years. She says she was 17 when Joshua first raped her, and that subsequent instances of rape by TB Joshua led to her having five forced abortions while there. ""These were backdoor type… medical treatments that we were going through… it could have killed us,"" she told the BBC. Other interviewees say they were stripped and beaten with electrical cables and horse whips, and routinely denied sleep. On his death in June 2021, TB Joshua was hailed as one of the most influential pastors in African history. Rising from poverty, he built an evangelical empire that counted dozens of political leaders, celebrities and international footballers among his associates. He did, however, attract some controversy during his lifetime when a guesthouse for church pilgrims collapsed in 2014, killing at least 116 people. The BBC's investigation, which was carried out with international media platform openDemocracy, is the first time multiple former church insiders have come forward to speak on the record. They say they've spent years trying to raise the alarm, but have effectively been silenced. A number of our witnesses in Nigeria claim they were physically attacked, and in one case shot at, after previously speaking out against the abuse and posting videos containing allegations on YouTube. A BBC crew that attempted to record footage of the church's Lagos compound from a public street in March 2022 was also fired at by the church's security, and was detained for a number of hours. The BBC contacted Scoan with the allegations in our investigation. It did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" it wrote. Four of the British citizens who spoke to the BBC say they reported the abuse to the UK authorities after escaping the church. They say no further action was taken. In addition, a British man and his wife emailed eyewitness accounts of their ordeal and video evidence - including recordings of being held at gunpoint by men describing themselves as police who are also members of Scoan - to the British High Commission in Nigeria in March 2010 after fleeing the church. In his email, the man said his wife had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped by Joshua. He warned the commission that other British nationals were still inside the compound facing atrocities. He also says no action was taken. The UK Foreign Office did not respond to these claims, but told the BBC that it takes all reports of crime, including sexual assault and violence against British nationals overseas, very seriously. Scoan continues to thrive today, under the leadership of Joshua's widow, Evelyn. In July 2023, she led a tour of Spain. Anneka, who left Derby in the UK to join Scoan at the age of 17, told the BBC she believes there are many other victims who have yet to speak out. She hopes further steps will be taken to uncover Joshua's actions. ""I believe the Synagogue Church of All Nations needs a thorough investigation into why this man was able to function for so long the way he did,"" she said.

Testimony from dozens of survivors suggests Joshua was abusing and raping young women from around the world several times a week for nearly 20 years. Warning: Contains accounts of torture, rape and self-harm In early 2002, in the depths of a grey English winter, 21-year-old Rae disappeared. The last time many of her friends saw her was at university in Brighton. She had been studying graphic design, living in a shared house 25 minutes from the sea. Rae was bright and popular. ""For me, it was like she died, but I couldn't grieve her,"" says Carla, Rae's best friend at the time. Carla knew where Rae had gone. But the truth of it was hard to explain to their friends. A few weeks previously, she and Rae had travelled to Nigeria together, in search of a mysterious man who could seemingly heal people with his hands. He was a Christian pastor, with a black beard, in white robes. His name was TB Joshua. His followers called him ""The Prophet"". Rae and Carla planned to visit his church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations [Scoan], for just one week. But Rae never came home. She had moved into Joshua's compound. ""I left her there,"" says Carla, tears flowing freely. ""Never will I ever forgive myself for that."" The church looms like a gothic temple over the Ikotun neighbourhood in Lagos, Africa's largest city. Joshua designed all 12 storeys of the compound adjoining it, where he lived alongside many of his followers. He oversaw the construction of the multiple staircases to his bedroom. The three doors to it, in and out. The hidden prayer room full of tiny mirrors. The ""clinic"" downstairs. We have interviewed many people who lived inside. They paint a picture of a concrete labyrinth: a nightmarish world where reality slipped away and horrors unfolded. Numerous women say they were sexually assaulted by Joshua, with a number claiming they were repeatedly raped behind closed doors. Some say they were forced to have abortions after becoming pregnant. Today, Rae is back in England, living in a beautiful hamlet in the countryside. She's smiley and laughs freely, but there's something restless about her. ""On the outside I look normal, but I'm not,"" she says. When Rae talks about her years in Lagos, her lips tighten. She talks breathlessly. At times, the colour visibly drains from her face. She spent 12 years inside Joshua's compound. ""This story is like a horror story. It's like something you watch in fiction, but it's true."" The two-year investigation, in collaboration with international media platform openDemocracy, has involved more than 15 BBC journalists across three continents. They gathered archive video recordings, documents, and hundreds of hours of interviews to corroborate Rae's testimony and uncover further harrowing stories. More than 25 eyewitnesses and alleged victims, from the UK, Nigeria, Ghana, US, South Africa and Germany, have provided accounts of what it was like inside Joshua's compound, with the most recent experiences in 2019. The Synagogue Church of All Nations did not respond to the allegations, but said previous claims have been unfounded. Former followers have previously tried to speak out about abuse, but say they have been silenced or discredited by Scoan, and two say they were physically assaulted. When the BBC's Africa Eye was filming outside the church, a security guard shot above the heads of the crew after they refused to hand over their material. Many of our interviewees have waived their legal right to anonymity, in most cases asking just their surnames be omitted. Others asked that their identities remain hidden for fear of reprisals. The man at the heart of Scoan is regarded as one of the most influential pastors in African history. He died, unexpectedly, in June 2021, just days after many of our first interviews were recorded. On the day of his funeral, Lagos ground to a halt as mourning crowds packed the streets. Some 50,000 people would attend Joshua's services every week, and the church became a top site for foreign visitors to Nigeria. His global television and social media empire was among the most successful Christian networks in the world, with millions of viewers spanning Europe, the Americas, South East Asia and Africa. His YouTube channel had hundreds of millions of views. The church is still popular today, led by his widow Evelyn and a new team of disciples. An interview with Nelson Mandela's daughter in 2013 shows a portrait of Joshua sitting on the former president of South Africa's desk. In his lifetime, Joshua attracted dozens of politicians and celebrities to his church, including sporting legends such as Chelsea FC striker Didier Drogba and at least nine African presidents. For support and information on sexual abuse, please consult this BBC Actionline within the UK. And for more information on cults, please see The Family Survival Trust Many of his followers were drawn by his philanthropy, but most came for his so-called miracles. Joshua systematically filmed spectacular ""healings"" throughout his career. After Joshua prayed for them, individuals on camera testified to being cured of ailments ranging from cancer and HIV/Aids, to chronic migraines and blindness. ""We'd never… seen anything like that before,"" says Solomon Ashoms, a journalist who covers African religion. ""The mysteries that he had, the secrets that he carried, [were] what people followed."" A number of Joshua's videos show men with severely infected genitals, which burst open and then miraculously heal when he raises his arm in prayer. Others show women struggling to give birth, who instantaneously deliver their children when Joshua approaches. After each event, those involved would testify to being saved. Video tapes of Joshua's healings were circulating among evangelical churches throughout Europe and Africa in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Rae, who had grown up with conservative Christian values, was inspired to travel to Lagos after watching these videos, shown to her by a South African acquaintance. ""I was gay and I didn't want to be,"" she says. ""I thought: 'Well, maybe this is the answer to my problems. Maybe this man can straighten me out. Like if he prays for me, I won't be gay any more.'"" Another British woman, Anneka, from Derby, in the Midlands, says she was also entranced by the videos. ""The whole room went completely still,"" she says, describing the moment her church congregation first encountered the tapes when she was 16. ""This is what Jesus would have done,"" she remembers thinking. She, too, went on to travel to Nigeria. Neither Rae nor Anneka, nor many of the young people who left their home countries to meet Joshua in the early 2000s, paid for their tickets. Church groups across England raised funds to send pilgrims to Lagos to witness these miracles - and Joshua contributed Scoan money himself, senior former church insiders say. Later, once the church was well established, he charged high prices for pilgrims to come and stay. Bisola, a Nigerian who spent 14 years inside the compound, says courting Westerners was a key tactic. ""He used the white people to market his brand,"" she says. Former insiders estimate Joshua made tens of millions of dollars from pilgrims and other money streams - fundraising, video sales, and stadium appearances abroad. He rose from poverty to become one of Africa's richest pastors. ""That guy [was] a genius,"" says Agomoh Paul, a man once regarded as Joshua's number two in the church, who left after 10 years in the compound. ""Everything… [he did was] planned out."" A major part of this planning was the faking of the ""miracles"" says Agomoh Paul, which he says he oversaw. He and other sources say that those ""cured"" had often been paid to perform or exaggerate their symptoms before their supposed healing took place. In some cases, they say, people had been unknowingly drugged or given medicine to improve their conditions while at the church, and later persuaded to give testimony about their recovery. Others were falsely told they had tested positive for HIV/Aids and that, thanks to Joshua's ministrations, they had now become virus-free. When Rae landed in the seething heat of Lagos, she saw miracles too. Dozens of people came and testified to having been healed of serious illnesses. ""I had a really involuntary reaction. I just broke down in floods of tears,"" she says. It was then that Rae was chosen. Joshua singled her out to become a ""disciple"" - an elite group of followers who served him and lived with him inside his compound. Rae thought she was going to study under Joshua, to ""cure"" her sexuality, to learn how to heal people. The reality was very different. ""We all thought we were in heaven, but we were in hell,"" she says. ""And in hell terrible things happen."" Disciples: The Cult of TB Joshua A shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse perpetrated by one of the most powerful religious figures of the 21st Century Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC Africa YouTube channel (outside UK) World of Secrets - The Disciples A nine-episode season - a shocking journey into a maze of manipulation and terrifying abuse Listen now on BBC Sounds Sixteen of the former disciples we interviewed, including Rae, provided first-hand testimony of sexual assault or rape by Joshua. Many say it happened frequently - as much as two to four times a week - for the duration of their time in the compound. Some described violent rapes which left them struggling to breath or bleeding. Many believed they were the only ones being assaulted and did not dare share what was happening to them with the other disciples, as they were all encouraged to report on each other. According to Victoria, who asked us to change her name for safety reasons, and who spent more than five years in the compound, other sexual assault victims were often hand picked by Joshua from the church congregation. She says she was picked out while attending the church's Sunday school, and says she was raped in Joshua's private quarters a few months later, after her parents entrusted her into his care. She was then recruited as a resident disciple. Victoria says Joshua ordered some of his most trusted Nigerian disciples to help identify new victims. The group was informally known as the ""fishing department"" and she says it ultimately coerced her into joining. Another disciple involved in similar recruitment was Bisola. ""TB Joshua asked me to recruit virgins for him… So that he could bring them into the disciple-fold and disvirgin them,"" she says. She participated because of both ""indoctrination"" and threats of violence, she says, adding she herself was repeatedly raped by Joshua. A number of women say they were under the age of legal of consent - which is 18 in Lagos state - when they were sexually assaulted or raped. This offence can lead to the death penalty in Nigeria. Jessica Kaimu, now a broadcast journalist in Namibia, says she was just 17 and a virgin when Joshua raped her in the bathroom of his penthouse, within weeks of her becoming a disciple. ""I was screaming and he was whispering in my ear that I should stop acting like a baby… I was so traumatised, I couldn't cry,"" she says. Jessica says this encounter was repeated again and again, throughout the five years she spent as a disciple. Her account mirrors that of other women who spoke to the BBC, and also of accounts by four of Joshua's male personal servants who were given the job of clearing up the physical evidence of this abuse. Many of the details of our interviewees' accounts are too graphic to publish. They include multiple first-hand accounts of women being stripped naked, and raped with objects - including one woman who says it happened to her twice before the age of 15. ""It was so painful, he violated me,"" the woman, who asked to remain anonymous, says. ""Words cannot properly express it. It scarred me for life."" A number of interviewees who say they were raped and became pregnant by Joshua, explain how they were also then given forced abortions inside the compound - in an area known as the ""medical department"" or ""clinic"". ""It would all be done in secrecy,"" says Sihle, a South African former disciple, who says she had three forced abortions in the church. ""You are given a concoction to drink and you get sick. Or they put these metal pieces in your vagina and they extract whatever. And you don't know whether they're [accidentally] pulling out your womb."" Sihle wept throughout her interview, as did Jessica who says she was given five forced abortions. Bisola says she witnessed ""dozens"" of abortions during her 14 years inside the church. At times, she says she would climb to the highest floor of the compound and cry, begging God to save her. The disciples served Joshua's every need. They gave him massages, helped him dress, sprayed perfume when he entered the room. They placed plastic gloves on his hands so he could eat his food without touching a crumb. Rather than call him by his name, they were all encouraged to address him as ""Daddy"". It's not uncommon for a Nigerian pastor in the Pentecostal tradition to be addressed this way, but the disciples say it was a term Joshua insisted on. ""My mind was like it had been shaken,"" says Anneka. ""There was no cognitive clarity at all... Reality was skewed completely."" The physical design of the compound deepened their disorientation. ""It was a maze of staircases,"" says Rae. In 2014, the construction cost lives. A six-storey guest house built for international guests collapsed, killing at least 116 people. A subsequent local government report found structural failure and shoddy building work to be the cause of the collapse. No-one has ever been prosecuted. Some of our interviewees told us they believe the death toll was significantly higher than reported, explaining that a number of Nigerian nationals who had been working on the guesthouse were not listed as victims, and that church members had botched rescue attempts and hidden bodies at night. They say Joshua also prevented the emergency services from assisting rescue efforts in the immediate aftermath, ever aware of his public profile. His grip on communication was always tight, our sources say. Rae says it was only after she left that she realised that her family and friends had been sending her emails. She had never received them. Joshua restricted disciples' access to phones and email accounts, our interviewees say. ""He wanted to control everybody, everything,"" says Agomoh Paul. ""What he was really scrambling for [was] the control of people's minds."" The disciples say they were made to work, without pay, for long hours each day - running all aspects of the megachurch. All say sleep deprivation was routine, with lights left on in the dormitories at night. Anneka says they never had more than four hours of sleep at a time. If anyone was caught napping without permission, or contravening any other of Joshua's rules, they would be punished. Nineteen former disciples described witnessing violent attacks or torture within the compound, carried out by Joshua or on his orders. Other disciples described being stripped and whipped themselves, with electrical cables and a horse whip known as a koboko. Among those allegedly targeted in this way were trainee disciples as young as seven. The compound in Lagos had 12ft-high [3.7m] walls and armed guards. But what really kept the disciples there was the fanatical loyalty he generated, and deep-rooted fears instilled by Joshua about what might happen to them if they did escape. ""It was a psychological prison,"" says Rae. ""It's extremely difficult to understand how somebody can go through psychological abuse to the extent that they lose their critical thinking."" ""Scoan fits the definition of a cult rather precisely,"" says Dr Alexandra Stein, an honorary fellow at the University of Sussex and member of The Family Survival Trust, which raises public awareness of cult groups. She has encountered multiple Scoan survivors, and says Joshua isolated his victims, putting them through ""coercively controlling processes of stress, fear, guilt and shame"". She adds this meant they became too frightened to leave. All the BBC interviewees spoke of ""brainwashing"", ""indoctrination"" and ""mind control"" - and many described life as a disciple under Joshua as like being in a ""cult"". Rae says for her, it is the psychological torture that has left the deepest scars. She says Joshua subjected her to a form of punishment known as ""adaba"" for two years, during which she was forbidden from leaving the compound, and nobody inside was allowed to talk to her. ""I was basically in total isolation… I had a complete breakdown,"" she says. ""I tried to commit suicide five times."" In being pushed to the brink, something cracked in Rae's mind. Twelve years of indoctrination began to unravel. ""He made a huge mistake, he lost control of me,"" she says. While travelling with the church on a tour to Mexico, Rae slipped away from the disciples. She never went back. Her life is now very different. But she has to live with the disappointment that there is no way to hold Joshua to account. ""TB Joshua dying before facing justice for the atrocities he committed, has been deeply frustrating. It's only added to the gross sense of injustice felt by all of us as his victims."" We contacted Scoan with the allegations in our investigation. They did not respond to them, but denied previous claims against TB Joshua. ""Making unfounded allegations against Prophet TB Joshua is not a new occurrence… None of the allegations was ever substantiated,"" they wrote.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67901064,Ousman Sonko: Gambian ex-minister goes on trial in Switzerland for murder,"A Gambian former interior minister has gone on trial in Switzerland, charged with crimes against humanity.",2024-01-08,"A Gambian former interior minister has gone on trial in Switzerland, charged with crimes against humanity. Ousman Sonko fled there in 2016, shortly before Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, accused of heading a repressive regime, lost power. Mr Sonko, 54, was arrested after non-governmental organisations presented evidence of his alleged involvement in killings, rape and torture. But his lawyer said that he was not responsible for what happened. Philippe Currat is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that The Gambia's National Intelligence Agency, which was ""never... under [his] authority"" was behind the alleged crimes. Switzerland is trying the case under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows countries to prosecute people on their territory, even though the events may have taken place elsewhere. Mr Sonko is the highest-ranking government official ever to be prosecuted under this principle in Europe. Human rights groups believe the trial, taking place in the southern Swiss city of Bellinzona, could be a warning to repressive governments everywhere that the arm of the law can be very long indeed. Switzerland's charge sheet against Mr Sonko is extensive. It includes the participation in, or ordering of, killings, torture and rape - all targeting political opponents. These could constitute crimes against humanity under Swiss law. Swiss investigators travelled to The Gambia and interviewed dozens of alleged victims and witnesses - nine will be in court to testify. From 1996 until 2016, The Gambia was ruled by President Yahya Jammeh, whose time in office, according to Human Rights Watch, was characterised by ""widespread abuses, including forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings"". Mr Sonko was Mr Jammeh's right-hand man, his role as interior minister putting him in charge of the security services, including, allegedly, a sinister paramilitary group known as ""the Junglers"". But in 2016, shortly before Mr Jammeh himself lost power, Mr Sonko fled to Switzerland, where he claimed asylum. Within months he was arrested, after an NGO, Trial International, gave the Swiss authorities details of abuses he was allegedly involved in. After six trips to The Gambia and 40 interviews with complainants, the Swiss attorney general drew up the charge sheet. This is only the second time that Switzerland has ever tried someone under universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity. The first case, in June 2023, saw former Liberian militia leader Alieu Kosiah sentenced to 20 years for crimes including rape, murder, and cannibalism. Other countries are also bringing cases against former members of Mr Jammeh's regime. In October, Germany handed a life sentence for crimes against humanity to Bai Lowe, a one-time member of ""the Junglers"". Later this year, a court in the US state of Colorado will begin the trial of an alleged former member of the same group. Although The Gambia has created its own transitional justice process to address abuses committed under Mr Jammeh's rule, human rights groups say its work has so far been very slow. Even in the Swiss trial against Mr Sonko, one of the plaintiffs who had been scheduled to testify died before the case came to court. But for those who do testify, ""being invited before a court of law, to tell their stories, is a way for them to heal. And if the federal court does reach a guilty verdict, it will be an enormous relief for them. They will get the answers they have been waiting for for many years,"" Trial International's Benoit Meystre said. The court case is expected to last a month with a verdict coming in March.","['Yahya Jammeh', 'The Gambia', 'Switzerland']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/153BC/production/_132227968_8e1fd363c4f1a059b829c42729afff567f8b6b9620_603_6828_38431000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1ED6/production/_107249870_afp.jpg']",['Imogen Foulkes'],World,Africa

Despite its relative stability, the region has endured armed conflict, and grabbed the world headlines with an upsurge in pirate attacks on international shipping in the Indian Ocean. Puntland is a destination for many Somalis displaced by violence in the south. Unlike its neighbour, breakaway Somaliland, Puntland says it does not seek recognition as an independent entity, wishing instead to be part of a federal Somalia. The territory takes its name from the Land of Punt, a centre of trade for the ancient Egyptians and a place shrouded in legend. President:  Said Abdullahi Dani Said Abdullahi Dani, won a second four-year term in January 2024, making him the first regional leader to win re-election since the state declared autonomy in 1998. The former federal planning minister, was first elected president in January 2019. In his victory speech, he urged Somalis ""to forget the past and open a new page for peace, development and unity"". Former Somali foreign affairs minister Abshir Omar Jama, who was backed by the federal government, finished third. Deni faces huge challenges in his second term, including insecurity, political wrangling with the federal government and tensions with the newly-declared Khatumo state as well as the breakaway region of Somaliland.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29234245,Nigeria's disgraced televangelist TB Joshua,"Before his death in 2021 at the age of 57, TB Joshua was one of Africa's most influential televangelists.",2024-01-08,"Before his death in 2021 at the age of 57, TB Joshua was one of Africa's most influential televangelists. The Christian preacher attracted followers from all over the world by claiming to perform miracles, like curing blindness and HIV. However, an investigation by the BBC has uncovered more than a decade of allegations of rape and torture by him inside his compound in Lagos. Joshua amassed great wealth throughout his career, possessing a fleet of cars and travelling via private jet. But his beginnings were far more humble. Born Temitope Balogun Joshua to a poor family on 12 June 1963, he was raised by a Muslim uncle after his Christian father died. One of the claims he made was that he had been in his mother's womb for 15 months. He also said that during his early days, he experienced a three-day trance in which he was called to serve God. ""I am your God. I am giving you a divine commission to go and carry out the work of the heavenly father,"" Joshua declared. It was then that he started the Synagogue, Church of All Nations (Scoan), with eight members. Joshua and Scoan rose to prominence in the late 1990s, amid an explosion of ""miracle"" programmes performed by pastors on Nigerian TV. Tens of thousands of followers from Nigeria and around the world would regularly attend his services in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, in an attempt to be healed and hear the preacher's ""prophecies"". Joshua also took his ministry on tour, visiting other African countries, the UK, US, and nations in South America. In testament to his vast reach, the Lagos state government turned to Joshua in an effort to control the spread of Ebola during the 2014 outbreak in other West African countries. Officials asked Joshua to tell infected followers in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - the worst affected countries - not to travel to Joshua's Lagos church for healing. He agreed to suspend some of the church's healing programmes but is also said to have sent 4,000 bottles of ""anointing water"" to Sierra Leone, falsely claiming they could cure the disease. Joshua's anointing water was always in high demand - in 2013 a rush for the bottles at his church in Ghana led to the death of four people in a stampede. Many criticised the preacher following the incident but police in Ghana said it was difficult to apportion blame. In an even deadlier case the following year, one of Joshua's churches collapsed in Lagos, killing at least 116 people. The preacher never faced charges, despite a coroner in a Lagos court saying that ""the church was culpable because of criminal negligence"". Although thousands packed his churches, Joshua always struggled to be accepted by his peers. Ostracised by both the Christian Association of Nigeria (Can) and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), he was described as an ""impostor"" who belonged to a group of ""occults"" that had infiltrated Christianity. ""He was rough. He was crude. His methods were unorthodox,"" Abimbola Adelakun, assistant professor in the African Studies Department at the University of Texas, told the BBC in 2021. While the growth of the internet and social media helped him spread his message, it also revealed increasing opposition to Joshua and other wealthy mega-church pastors. Some critics took issue with Joshua - known as ""the prophet"" by his followers - claiming to have predicted numerous events, from the death of Michael Jackson, to the disappearance of the Malaysian plane MH370 in 2014. Before Jackson's death in 2009, TB Joshua told his congregation : ""In his own area he is famous. He is known everywhere. Great. Too great. Because I see something will begin to happen to that star and that will likely end in him to pack his load and go to the journey of no return but I don't know when that journey [is]."" Six months later, Joshua used the star's shock death as proof that he could supposedly see the future. Despite making such outlandish claims, Joshua had numerous high-profile followers. South African politician Julius Malema, Malawi's former President Joyce Banda, long-time Zimbabwe opposition leader, the late Morgan Tsvangirai and the former president of Ghana, the late John Atta Mills, are among the prominent Africans who paid homage to Joshua while he was alive. Joshua career really took off when he began preaching on Emmanuel TV, a television station run by Scoan. Along with being a platform for his sermons, the station broadcast accounts of people who said their lives were changed for the better because of the preacher's ministry. Testimonies included stories about financial prosperity, inexplicable recoveries from illness and even people supposedly being awakened from the dead. Joshua was also known for his charity work, for which Nigeria's former president, the late Umaru Yar'Adua, awarded him the Order of the Federal Republic, one of the country's highest honours. When the preacher died - of a cause that was never made public - mourners travelled from across the globe to Lagos for his burial service. His wife, Evelyn Joshua, took over as head of the the church. They had three children. But that legacy now lies in tatters. Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

This marks the first Golden Globe win for a non-English animated feature. Billed as Mr Miyazaki's final feature, it was up against Disney productions such as Wish and Elemental in the animated feature category. The film centres on a young boy who meets a mysterious speaking heron after losing his mother during World War Two. It echoes parts of Mr Miyazaki's life story. Like the boy, his own family was evacuated to the countryside during the war. Mr Miyazaki also had a deep bond with his own mother, who was said to have had a large influence on his work and the strong female characters in his films. The Golden Globes have traditionally been seen as a bellwether for the Oscars. Mr Miyazaki's 2001 feature, Spirited Away, won an Oscar in the animated feature category. Mr Miyazaki came out of retirement to make The Boy and the Heron, and spent seven years on the production. He directed and wrote the original screenplay for the film. The film was reportedly the first original anime film to top the North American box office after it was released there in December. It first premiered in Japan in June and has been a box office hit in many countries, grossing more than $136m (£107m) worldwide. Producer Toshio Suzuki said last year that it was one of the most expensive Japanese films ever made. While the filmmakers were not present in Los Angeles to accept the award, Mr Suzuki said on Monday: ""This is the first Golden Globe awarded to a Studio Ghibli film and it is a very special feeling."" Alongside Mr Miyazaki, he is one of several co-founders of Studio Ghibli. ""Since the beginning of this year, Japan has been hit by a series of tragic earthquakes and accidents... In such a situation, I hope the bright news of winning an award can bring a smile to everyone's face, even if only a little,"" he added.","['Golden Globes', 'Film', 'Asia', 'Japan', 'Animation']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1A06/production/_132226660_aff2dca5dd97775824f8281b1eff8cf1e4bcf82a0_0_4592_34241000x746.jpg'],['Kelly Ng'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67909061,India summons Maldives envoy over ministers' remarks,India summoned the high commissioner of Maldives after a row broke out over derogatory posts made by three officials about PM Narendra Modi.,2024-01-08,"India summoned the high commissioner of Maldives after a row broke out over derogatory posts made by three officials about PM Narendra Modi. The deputy ministers, who have been suspended, called Mr Modi a ""clown"", ""terrorist"" and a ""puppet of Israel"". A foreign ministry spokesperson said the comments were personal and did not represent the views of the government. Male's response came after the remarks set off an uproar and boycott calls on Indian social media . ""All government officials responsible for the comments have been suspended from their posts effective immediately"", a spokesperson for President Mohamed Muizzu's office told the BBC. There is already tension between India and the island nation after Mr Muizzu asked a contingent of about 75 Indian troops to leave the country after he came to power last year. The three suspended ministers are Malsha Shareef, Mariyam Shiuna and Abdulla Mahzoom Majid. Despite strong calls for their sacking, Maldivian media noted the three officials have been only suspended. The trio made the controversial comments in response to Mr Modi's post on X (formerly Twitter) which included photos promoting tourism to the Indian island chain of Lakshadweep. Ms Shiuna also compared India with cow dung. This sparked outrage on Indian social media and got hashtags such as #BoycottMaldives and #ExploreIndianIslands trending. Some said they would cancel their holidays to the Maldives - Indians were among the largest group of tourists who visited the Maldives last year. The CEO of Indian ticket-booking site EaseMyTrip said his company had suspended all flight bookings to the Maldives. The archipelago is famous for its silver sand beaches, resorts and coral islands. Prominent Indians, including Bollywood star Akshay Kumar as well as some cricketers, expressed dismay over the comments. Former Maldivian president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih strongly condemned what he termed as ""hateful language against India"" by the three officials. ""India has always been a good friend to Maldives, and we must not allow such callous remarks to negatively impact the age-old friendship between our two countries"", he said on X. Another former president Mohamed Nasheed called the language in the social media posts ""appalling"". The controversial posts were deleted following the uproar. On Monday, the Maldives's high commissioner to India, Ibrahim Shaheeb, was seen leaving the Indian foreign ministry's office in Delhi. India's envoy to Maldives also visited the country's foreign ministry on Monday but the country's High Commission said it was for a ""pre-arranged meeting"" to discuss bilateral issues. The controversy comes ahead of Mr Muizzu making a five-day state visit to India's rival China beginning Monday. Mr Muizzu's trip to Beijing is considered a high-profile snub to India as previous Maldivian leaders first visited India after being elected. He chose Turkey as his first international port of call after he took over in November. This will be seen as a diplomatic setback for Delhi, which is trying to match China's growing footprint in the Indian Ocean region. ""It is for them to decide where they go and how they go about their international relations,"" Indian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last week in response to questions on Mr Muizzu's visit to Beijing. He also said there was no update on the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Maldives. India says its security personnel are in the Maldives to maintain three maritime rescue and surveillance aircraft it had donated to the country. The Indian Ocean archipelago has long been under India's sphere of influence and Mr Muizzu wants to change that. In December, the Maldivian government said it was terminating a bilateral agreement with India that permitted Delhi to collaborate in mapping the seabed in Maldivian territorial waters. A Maldivian government spokesman said the deal, set to expire in June next year, would not be renewed. Soon after he won the elections in October last year, Mr Muizzu told the BBC he would review all the bilateral agreements signed with India by the previous administration of Mr Solih, who had adopted an India First policy. Delhi and Beijing are competing for a foothold in the strategically located islands.

Efforts are continuing to find more than 100 people who remain missing a week later. But bad weather is hampering rescuers- with heavy rain and snow triggering warnings of landslides and building collapses. The 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the remote Noto peninsula - toppling buildings and sparking a major fire. The majority of the deaths have happened in the hard-hit cities of Wajima and Suzu. Meanwhile, the number of people missing has dropped from 195 to just over 100. The death toll has jumped from the 120 reported on Sunday. More than 2,000 people are reportedly still cut off due to massive damage to roads. Several others are living in emergency shelters. The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday that it had sent nearly 6,000 troops out to help with the relief mission. They added that they believe there are still people alive who need rescue and vowed to continue their lifesaving operations despite the ending of a critical 72 hour window to find survivors. Stories of miraculous recoveries have been emerging. A woman in her 90s was found alive under rubble five days in Suzu. Those in the worst-affected areas are being urged to keep their guard up as they continue to experience further quakes. As of early Monday local time, more than 1,200 tremors had been recorded since New Year's Day, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reports. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and activity has been increasing around Noto since the end of 2020.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67889387,Bangladesh election: PM Sheikh Hasina wins fourth term in controversial vote,Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has secured her fourth straight term in a controversial election.,2024-01-08,"Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has secured her fourth straight term in a controversial election. Ms Hasina will serve another five years in office after her party the Awami League and its allies won 223 of 300 parliamentary seats contested. With the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party boycotting the poll, Ms Hasina's party and allies are expected to win the remaining seats as well. The BNP alleged the poll was a sham. Sunday's result comes after mass arrests of BNP leaders and supporters. Official figures suggested a low voter turnout of about 40%, though critics say even those numbers may be inflated. In comparison, the last election in 2018 had a voter turnout of more than 80%. Political analyst Badiul Alam Majumder told the BBC that the election commission was inflating the voter turnout. ""From different sources and media reports, we have seen that the turnout (provided by the election commission) doesn't match with the reality,"" he said. Independents, almost all of them from the Awami League itself, won 45 seats and the Jatiya Party won eight seats. Results are expected to be announced officially later on Monday. It is the fifth term in total for Ms Hasina, who first became prime minister in 1996 and was re-elected in 2009, remaining in power since. ""I am trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country,"" she told reporters as she cast her vote. Awami League general secretary Obaidul Quader told reporters that Ms Hasina had instructed party leaders and supporters not to hold victory processions or indulge in celebrations. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimates that nearly 10,000 activists were arrested after an opposition rally on 28 October turned violent, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 people and injuring more than 5,500. It accused the government of ""filling prisons with the ruling Awami League's political opponents"". The Awami League has denied these accusations. Fears have been raised that this new victory for the Awami League could lead to de-facto one party rule. Very few expect the government to relax its crackdown - particularly if opposition parties and civil society groups continue to raise questions over the legitimacy of the government. The BNP boycotted the election after the Awami League rejected their demands for an independent caretaker government to preside over the polls. Until then, ""our peaceful and non-violent movement will vigorously continue,"" Tarique Rahman, the acting chairman of the BNP, told the BBC by email from London where he has lived since 2008. Mr Rahman, who is the son of Ms Hasina's bitter rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, also denied accusations that BNP party workers were involved in arson attacks in the run up to the poll. Ms Zia is currently under house arrest on charges of corruption. In 2018 Mr Rahman was convicted in absentia of orchestrating a grenade attack on a campaign rally for Ms Hasina in 2004 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Ms Hasina was injured and at least 20 others were killed in that incident. ""All allegations against me are baseless and rooted in political vengeance,"" he said. The BNP also called on people to not cast their votes. But Ms Hasina's supporters insist she has provided much-needed political stability for Bangladesh. ""We have continued the democratic process which has given this political stability. I think the world should credit Sheikh Hasina for that,"" says Law Minister Anisul Huq. Ms Hasina's single biggest achievement in the past 15 years ""is the confidence that she has ushered in in the minds of the people of Bangladesh. They have come to believe in themselves,"" he added. Bangladesh under Ms Hasina presents a contrasting picture. The Muslim-majority nation, once one of the world's poorest, has achieved credible economic success under her leadership since 2009. It's now one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, even surpassing its giant neighbour India. Its per capita income has tripled in the last decade and the World Bank estimates that more than 25 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 20 years. It is also the world's second largest garment producer after China. But the economy spun into turmoil in mid-2022 following the pandemic and a global economic slowdown. With rising inflation and conditions for an IMF loan it took earlier kicking in, the government may struggle to tackle public fallout. International pressure is also kicking in. In September, Washington began imposing visa restrictions on Bangladeshi officials found culpable of undermining the country's democratic election process. The UN and other international organisations have also expressed alarm over human rights abuses and the stifling of dissent. But Ms Hasina is aware that as long as India backs her, any threat of major sanctions by the West can be countered. Developed countries are also aware that any withdrawal of concessions to Bangladesh's garment industry would hit millions of workers, most of whom are women. Ms Hasina first became the country's prime minister in 1996. She was re-elected in 2009 and has stayed in power since, making her the longest-serving leader in Bangladesh's history. By the end of her term as prime minister, she will be 81. Who will succeed her is a big question for many in Bangladesh, including supporters of the Awami League. As some analysts say, ""the election result was clear, but the future looks uncertain"".","['Sheikh Hasina', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8BCE/production/_132209753_547e8bfd25f3c15ff38bf91c8b424eccbe492b530_0_4099_24641000x601.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1280E/production/_132209757_gettyimages-1553913077.jpg']","['Ethirajan Anbarasan', 'Kelly Ng']",World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67891869,Taiwan election: China sows doubt about US with disinformation,"The rumour was old, but effective: the Taiwanese were being fed ""poisonous"" pork imported from the US.",2024-01-08,"The rumour was old, but effective: the Taiwanese were being fed ""poisonous"" pork imported from the US. The weeks-old claim followed another: the Taiwanese government was secretly harvesting blood from citizens and giving it to the US to make a bioweapon to attack China. Both were swiftly debunked. But this is a narrative that has been blooming in Taiwan ahead of Saturday's presidential and legislative elections. ""Yimeilun"" or US scepticism, questions the faithfulness of Taiwan's biggest ally, portraying the island as a pawn exploited by America. Its ultimate goal, say analysts, is to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the US - and push the Taiwanese into the welcoming arms of China. ""There seems to be this narrative that the US will not support Taiwan, or will abandon it if there's a war, or the situation is not advantageous to the US,"" said Kuang-shun Yang, a disinformation researcher who coined the term in 2018. Disinformation experts say China has a hand in spreading this message, and may even be creating it. Their evidence also points to Taiwanese close to Beijing. It's not always conspiracy theories - most of the time it's a highlighting of news that shows the US in a bad light, or points to it as an untrustworthy superpower. ""For China, this is a battle for public opinion,"" said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese expert in Chinese disinformation and Democratic Progressive Party's legislature nominee. ""To persuade everyone that China is the better country is more difficult, but to persuade everyone that America is problematic is relatively easier… to China that would be considered a success."" When Taiwanese chip giant TSMC expanded in the US, it was described as American coercion and a ""hollowing out"" of Taiwan's resources. And the US' arms sale to Taiwan was deemed as ""cheating"" the island of its money by sending it unreliable weapons. These were among 84 types of US scepticism narratives discovered by think tank IORG between 2021 and 2023 on Chinese-language media outlets, social media, online forum PTT and messaging platform LINE. Chinese provincial governments' propaganda departments and state media outlets amplified these narratives and in some cases were even the first-known sources. But most of the sources were Taiwanese politicians and media organisations friendly to China. There has long been suspicion of Chinese state influence and a 2019 Reuters report found evidence of mainland officials paying Taiwanese outlets for coverage. The bioweapons rumour first surfaced in an unsubstantiated Taiwanese newspaper report which some suggested involved Beijing. The US pork rumour began with online posts claiming, with no evidence, that the government was secretly passing off US pork as Taiwanese. Weeks later, others made the claim about poisonous US pork products that was traced to an old debunked report by a pro-China Hong Kong newspaper. The idea that US pork could be unsafe has dogged discussions in Taiwan for years. But it has returned right in time for what appears to be a tight presidential race. Mr Shen estimates that any disinformation campaign would only need to convince about 3% of voters to affect the outcome of the election. In the lead-up to the last election, in 2020, Taiwan saw a massive wave of anti-DPP disinformation that was believed to have come from China. Though it eventually failed - President Tsai Ing-wen won her second term by a landslide - it deeply alarmed many Taiwanese. But the political landscape has since changed. For one, tensions with China have spiked - Beijing has repeatedly reinforced unification as a goal, offering peace while not ruling out the use of force. And two, faith in the US is dwindling. Polls show the Taiwanese public still trusts the US far more than China. But the annual American Portrait survey conducted by Taiwanese academics found that last year only 34% of Taiwanese believe the US is a trustworthy country, compared to 45% in 2021. Another survey by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation found that 51% of Taiwanese in their early 20s identify with US scepticism narratives, the highest among all age groups. The polling organisation said one possible reason was because younger Taiwanese were more likely to be sent to the frontlines of any possible war. Most of this could be chalked up to America's own actions. The disastrous troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and a divided Congress' reluctance to continue funding Ukraine in its war, have contributed to Taiwanese fears that America would abandon it or fail to intervene if China attacks, say analysts. In 2021 Jaw Shaw-kong, the Kuomintang's vice-presidential candidate who has called for closer ties with China and promoted US scepticism, warned that ""if Taiwan does not want to become a second Afghanistan, then it has to think clearly if it wants war or peace"". US scepticism has also played a role in ""seeding"" doubt, said Chihhao Yu, the author of the IORG study. ""And then when the US makes a mistake, it would confirm previous suspicions."" Like other propaganda and disinformation, US scepticism too thrives on fear, whether it is about food safety or the threat of war. But it also mines something fundamental in the Taiwanese psyche: a decades-long insecurity about their relationship with America. This stems from Taiwan's ""orphan mentality"",  Mr Yang said. ""Taiwan was a colony of many empires, transferred again and again by its previous rulers. That historical perspective has always resided in the collective memory. ""But the most direct trigger was in 1979."" That was the year the US stunned the world and dismayed Taiwan when it formalised diplomatic relations with China after months of secret negotiations. By switching recognition from Taipei to Beijing, the US severed official ties with the island. But it also passed a law stating it must help Taiwan defend itself. To this day it maintains close informal relations with the island and sells it arms. But the diplomatic break-up planted the notion ""that Taiwan could be abandoned by the US again"", Mr Yang said. Such was the depth of hurt that it spawned a hit 1980s Taiwanese song called Orphan of Asia - it speaks of an ""orphan crying in the wind"" as ""the Western wind sings a sad song in the East"". This is why US scepticism often works in tandem with pro-China narratives as ""push and pull forces"" - encouraging Taiwan to engage more with China to guarantee peace, Mr Yang added. ""If Taiwan is an orphan, then it should be a prodigal son coming home to the great nation [of China], rather than remain as the subsidiary of the US."" American reassurances are the best antidotes to US scepticism, say analysts. ""If our ally can be more aware of the dangers of US scepticism and come out to reiterate the good aspects of our partnership… people would see that this [relationship] is good for us,"" Mr Yu said. ""China does this all the time, they talk about all the benefits Taiwan gets from China. But you don't see it that much in US policy messaging."" The island has bolstered its anti-disinformation defences with public education campaigns, reporting hotlines, and even AI chatbots that point out fake news. Taiwan's parliament also mulled anti-disinformation laws, though this sparked concerns of curbs on press freedom. But Taiwan is already estimated to be the most targeted place in the world for false information spread by foreign governments. Years of propaganda and disinformation have polarised society and created greater distrust of facts, according to Wei-ping Li, a researcher with anti-disinformation group Taiwan Factcheck Center. ""The problem is not so much the disinformation, it's people's attitude to information now… they will ask, can you even trust this? They will make a judgment about the credibility of the information based on their party affiliation or political views,"" she said. As Taiwan gets better at defending itself, so will China get better at influencing discourse with more sophisticated methods, Mr Shen warned.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67909348,Bilkis Bano: India Supreme Court cancels release of 2002 riots rapists,"Eleven men freed early after being found guilty of gang raping a pregnant Muslim woman must be returned to prison, India's Supreme Court has said.",2024-01-08,"Eleven men freed early after being found guilty of gang raping a pregnant Muslim woman must be returned to prison, India's Supreme Court has said. Part of a Hindu mob, the men were serving life terms for the attack on Bilkis Bano, as well as the murder of 14 of her family members, during anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat state in 2002. However, they were released in August 2022 by order of Gujarat's government. The order, and the celebrations as they left prison, caused global outrage. The article contains details that some readers may find disturbing Ms Bano said she had ""wept tears of relief"" on hearing that the decision to free her attackers had been overturned. She thanked the Supreme Court ""for giving me, my children and women everywhere this vindication and hope in the promise of equal justice for all"". She had petitioned the court after men were released. The two-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice BV Nagarathna, ruled that the state of Gujarat was ""not competent"" to pass the remission order in the case since the men had been tried and convicted in a court in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra. The bench added that since the government's remission order had been nullified, the 11 convicts must return to prison within two weeks. ""Justice encompasses not just the rights of the convicts but also the rights of the victims"" and the ""primary duty"" of the court is to uphold justice and rule of law, Justice Nagarathna said, adding that the ""rule of law must be preserved unmindful of the ripples of the consequences"". The landmark judgement is expected to create ripples, especially in Gujarat where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister at the time of the riots and was criticised for not doing enough to prevent the carnage. He has always denied wrongdoing and has not apologised for what happened in the riots. Gujarat's state government had sought the federal government's approval to release the men sentenced for attacking Ms Bano and her family. It was granted by the home ministry, led by Mr Modi's close aide Amit Shah. State officials said in court that the 11 men - first convicted by a trial court in 2008 - had spent more than 14 years in jail and were released after factors such as their age and good behaviour in prison were taken into consideration. When the men were freed in 2022 they were given a heroes' welcome as they left the jail in Godhra, with relatives giving them sweets and touching their feet to show respect. Federal prosecutors had argued they should not be ""released prematurely and no leniency may be shown"" to them as their crime was ""heinous, grave and serious"". After her attackers were freed, Bilkis Bano said the decision to release them had ""shaken her faith in justice"". ""How can justice for any woman end like this? I trusted the highest courts in our land. I trusted the system, and I was learning slowly to live with my trauma,"" she wrote, appealing to the Gujarat government to ""undo this harm"". The attack on Ms Bano and her family was one of the most horrific crimes during the riots, which began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a fire on a passenger train in the town of Godhra. Blaming Muslims for starting the fire, Hindu mobs attacked Muslim neighbourhoods. Over three days, more than 1,000 people died, most of them Muslims. The morning after the train fire, Ms Bano - then 19 and pregnant with her second child - was visiting her parents in a village called Randhikpur near Godhra with her three-year-old daughter. When rioters attacked the village and started setting Muslim homes on fire, she and 16 relatives went on the run, she told the BBC in 2017. Over the next few days, they sought shelter in mosques or subsisting on the kindness of Hindu neighbours. On the morning of 3 March 2002, a group of men attacked them ""with swords and sticks"". ""One of them snatched my daughter from my lap and threw her on the ground, bashing her head into a rock."" Her attackers were her neighbours, men she had seen almost daily while growing up. They tore off her clothes and several of them raped her, ignoring her pleas for mercy. Her cousin, who had given birth two days earlier, was raped and murdered and her newborn baby was killed too. Bilkis Bano survived because she lost consciousness and her attackers left, believing she was dead. Two boys - seven and four - were the only other survivors of the massacre. Her fight for justice has been long and nightmarish. It has been well documented that some police and state officials tried to intimidate her, evidence was destroyed and the dead were buried without post-mortem exams. The doctors who examined her said she hadn't been raped, and she received death threats. The first arrests in the case were made only in 2004 after India's Supreme Court handed over the case to federal investigators and transferred her case to Mumbai saying that courts in Gujarat could not deliver justice to her. Over the years, the courts have convicted dozens of people for involvement in the riots, but some high-profile accused won bail or were exonerated by higher courts. This included Maya Kodnani, an ex-minister in Mr Modi's Gujarat cabinet, whom a trial court had called ""a kingpin of the riots"" that took place in one area. In 2013, a Supreme Court panel ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Modi, who became prime minister the following year. But critics have continued to blame him for the riots happening on his watch.","['India', 'Asia']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15E42/production/_95966698_gettyimages-680237412.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E912/production/_95966695_gettyimages-98083379.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CDBA/production/_95966625_gettyimages-52003110.jpg']",['Geeta Pandey'],World,Asia

It is a longstanding policy of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to hold a referendum on becoming a republic. But a minister has told local media that such a vote is ""not a priority"" and there is ""no timeline"" for it. The government last week said it was expecting a visit from the king ""later this year"". The prime minister enjoyed a ""warm relationship"" with Charles, a government spokesperson said in a statement to The Australian. Buckingham Palace is yet to confirm the trip. The comments follow last year's defeat for the government in a separate referendum, in which Australians overwhelmingly rejected a plan to give greater political rights to Indigenous people. All six states voted against a proposal to amend the constitution to recognise First Nations people. Proponents said this would have ushered in a new era, but opponents called it divisive. Asked over the weekend about the government's plans for another referendum - on becoming a republic - a government minister told The Australian the issue was currently ""not a priority"". Pressed further on the topic on ABC on Monday, Assistant Minister for the Republic Matt Thistlethwaite said there was ""no timeline"". He instead highlighted the need to tackle cost-of-living issues. Like people in other nations, Australians have been suffering the effects of high inflation and rising interest rates. But Mr Thistlethwaite said he was ""not giving up"", and it was still the plan of the governing Labor Party for Australia to break away from the UK Royal Family ""longer term"". The country voted against cutting ties with the monarchy in a referendum in 1999. Calls have continued in the quarter-century since for another ballot. Mr Albanese has previously said an Australian republic is ""inevitable"" and appointed Mr Thistlethwaite as the country's first-ever minister dedicated to such a mission. Australian actor Hugh Jackman told the BBC last year that he, too, believed a break with the UK's Royal Family would be a natural part of his country's ""evolution"". But the X-Men star added that he held ""no ill-will"" towards King Charles and wished the family ""all the best"". New Zealand's former PM and current leader of the opposition, Chris Hipkins, has said he is also a republican who believes his own country will ""ideally"" leave the monarchy one day. Barbados became the world's newest republic in 2021, after removing Elizabeth II as its head of state - though it opted to remain in the Commonwealth. In a speech during the official ceremony, Charles - then the Prince of Wales - acknowledged the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"" the Caribbean island suffered during British colonial rule. Before Barbados, the last nation to remove the British monarch as head of state was Mauritius in 1992.","['King Charles III', 'Australia']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13B22/production/_132247608_3aa634ff4ee933140fe3223d7df48e57fc0a58700_184_3000_16871000x563.jpg'],['James FitzGerald'],World,Asia

The reptiles had an estimated market value of A$1.2m (£633,000: $805,000), according to New South Wales Police. Three men and a woman have been arrested in Sydney. Some 257 lizards and three snakes were seized by police after allegedly being kept in poor conditions. They have been treated and returned to the wild. Police set up a taskforce to investigate the alleged smugglers in September after 59 live lizards were intercepted in nine small containers on their way to Hong Kong. Officers have conducted a series of raids in New South Wales in the past few weeks. At one home in Sydney they seized 118 lizards, three snakes, eight eggs and 25 dead lizards. A search of a property in rural Grenfell turned up four lizards hidden in bags. The four suspects - all aged between 31 and 59 - have been charged with offences including exporting native reptiles, dealing with the proceeds of crime and participating in a criminal group, If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison. Two of the men were refused bail after appearing in court over the weekend. In recent decades, Hong Kong has grown to dominate the international trade in a range of exotic animals, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). In 2021, a study published by the ADM Capital Foundation found that over a five-year period, four million live animals from at least 84 countries were imported into the city.","['Wildlife trade', 'Hong Kong', 'Australia', 'Reptiles']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10272/production/_132226166_sfwhyaratta10.jpg'],['Hannah Ritchie'],World,Asia

Her refusal to acknowledge ""The 1992 consensus"", the vaguely-worded agreement which says Taiwan is part of ""One China"", led Beijing to label her a separatist. She has also said China needs to show Taiwan respect and that Taipei will not bow to pressure. The 67-year-old's strong stance has won her admirers and detractors in equal measure. With three presidential candidates vying to replace Ms Tsai in Saturday's election, and Beijing keeping a watchful eye on proceedings, the question of how to deal with China remains a key issue at the ballot box. Yet China has not been the only threat to her years in office, with other policy decisions leaving some wondering if she would be a one-term president. Attempts to promote green energy ended with her being accused of nearly causing an electricity shortage, while the offer of two days off a week for all workers was rejected amid allegations of hurting, rather than increasing, workers' earnings and holidays. Making Taiwan the first Asian society where gay marriage is legal - a move which earned her plaudits around the world - also damaged her popularity at home. Whether she would even run for a second term was uncertain, with a former subordinate challenging for her party's nomination and - at one point - her approval rating hitting the 15% mark. But it seems that her biggest headache - China - was the very thing that helped her decisively win another four years in office in the January 2020 elections. Ms Tsai positioned herself as a defender of Taiwan's sovereignty against China's view that the island must one day be unified with the mainland. Her main rival from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, Han Kuo-yu, pushed for closer relations with China. But as anti-China protests swept Hong Kong in 2019, fears of what it could mean for Taiwan's future began to rise - as, it seems, did Ms Tsai's fortunes. Her campaign pushed the notion that her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would stand up to Beijing and keep Taiwan a liberal democracy. ""Choosing Tsai Ing-wen... means we choose our future and choose to stand with democracy and stand with freedom,"" Ms Tsai told reporters the day before the country went to the polls. In a landslide victory she took just over 57% of the ballot - more than eight million votes - with Mr Han trailing on 38%. Ms Tsai is the youngest of 11 children, born in a coastal village in the south of Taiwan. She moved to the capital Taipei when she was 11. Her mixed ethnicity - Hakka father and Taiwanese mother - has been cited as one of the traits that helped her connect to supporters. She also has a grandmother who is from one of the non-Chinese indigenous groups in Taiwan. A law graduate of the National Taiwan University, Ms Tsai completed her master's degree at Cornell University Law School in 1980 and went on to earn a doctorate from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1984. In the 1990s, she was a negotiator for Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization. She was then asked to serve on the National Security Council as an adviser to former President Lee Teng-hui. Ms Tsai joined the DPP in 2004 and rose quickly to become its chairwoman four years later, when the party suffered a heavy defeat in the presidential elections. Her predecessor, Chen Shui-bian, lost to Ma Ying-jeou at the polls in 2008, and was later jailed for corruption. It was her style and bearing when she appeared on the political scene which set her apart from the rest of the DPP ""old guard"", something that has worked to her advantage in attracting younger voters. Despite splits and factionalism in the party, Ms Tsai was able to rally the support she needed to rejuvenate the DPP. Under her leadership, it has performed much better in local elections. Her first attempt at running for president failed in 2012, but she continued to build on her successes. Four years later, she was elected. Her first term in office saw Taiwan's minimum wage, investments and stocks rise. Social services, including childcare and elderly care, and public housing also received a boost. But her second term saw Ms Tsai face a range of challenges. In November 2022,  she resigned as party chair after the DPP's poor showing in local elections centred on municipal issues. This was followed by economic annual growth figures in 2023 projecting annual growth at just 1.42% - the lowest since 2009. The government's statistics bureau cited a larger-than-expected decrease in exports and investment. Through it all, Beijing has loomed large, with Chinese President Xi Jinping repeatedly saying that Taiwan's ""reunification"" with China is inevitable. It has been more than just words. In August 2022, Beijing staged huge military drills around Taiwan in a protest against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island. It has also repeatedly rehearsed encircling the island with fighter jets and navy ships, while Chinese military aircraft probe the edge of Taiwan's airspace on an almost daily basis. As she leaves office, China remains one of the biggest issues on the ballot - but, as it has been throughout her tenure, not the only one. Rising costs, unaffordable housing and shrinking opportunities have also driven dissatisfaction against the DPP - and sent young voters into the arms of the Taiwan People's Party and its populist candidate, Ko Wen-je. Whoever becomes the next president of Taiwan will have his work cut out dealing with these various issues. But there is no doubt that, for better or for worse, Ms Tsai's policies have changed the conversation around China - perhaps permanently.","['Asia', 'Taiwan']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2B26/production/_110464011_0ddf946f-421d-4ce5-8e10-3db8f76c60e5.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7946/production/_110464013_6a9a7bfa-4662-4c1c-85ca-2d272b998856.jpg']",['N/A'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-67914611,"MI6 spy detained in China, authorities claim","Chinese authorities say they have detained an individual alleged to be spying for Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6.",2024-01-08,"Chinese authorities say they have detained an individual alleged to be spying for Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6. China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) said the individual was a foreigner and was trying to collect information inside the country. It is the latest arrest in a campaign by Chinese security to clamp down on foreign spying. The British government has not commented on the claims. The news of the arrest came in a statement issued in a post from the MSS on the WeChat social network. It said the alleged spy was named ""Huang"" and came from a ""third country,"" implying they were neither British nor Chinese. It said consular visits had been arranged following the arrest but did not say from which country. China has increasingly been publicising cases of alleged espionage by Western countries. Previous cases have focused on alleged activity by the US's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) - so accusing Britain's MI6 is more unusual. Beijing has also launched public campaigns to raise awareness of foreign spying and calling on people to report any activity. In this latest case, the MSS alleged that in 2015, MI6 recruited the foreign national to create what was described as an ""intelligence cooperation relationship"". It said that after their recruitment, MI6 instructed them to go to China on multiple occasions and use their job as cover to collect intelligence and recruit other individuals. It claimed that they were provided with professional intelligence training in the UK and other locations and also equipped with specialist spy equipment to communicate. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the claims. The UK government has a policy of neither confirming nor denying claims relating to intelligence issues. The statement said the individual who had been detained was the head of a consulting agency overseas. China has been engaged in a crackdown on foreign business consultants operating in the country. It has accused some firms of trying to obtain information about Chinese businesses and gathering information which is sensitive or related to national security. Last year there were reports of raids, visits and arrests linked to companies like the US consulting firm Bain & Company. That led some companies to change the way they operate in China. Last July, a new anti-espionage law also came into effect which broadened the type of information that is covered and the types of activity which people could be prosecuted over. China said that official assessments indicated the arrested individual had provided MI6 with nine pieces of information considered secret and five considered confidential as well as three other pieces of intelligence. The MSS statement said the case had been uncovered ""recently"" after a ""meticulous investigation"" and that ""criminal enforcement measures"" had been taken under the law. The US has regularly accused China of spying and stealing business secrets. In 2022 an MSS officer was, for the first time, sentenced to jail in the US after having been arrested in Belgium. The UK has also become more vocal about Chinese intelligence activities. In October, Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, the UK's domestic security service, described a ""pretty epic"" campaign of Chinese espionage. Speaking to the BBC at an event in the US designed to highlight concerns over China, he said more than 20,000 people in the UK had been approached covertly online by Chinese spies. MI5 has also accused China of trying to interfere in parliament and political life, issuing an ""interference alert"" two years ago.",['Spying'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/609E/production/_132243742_chinauk.png'],['Gordon Corera'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538,What's behind China-Taiwan tensions?,At the heart of the issue is China's claim over self-governed Taiwan.,2024-01-08,"At the heart of the issue is China's claim over self-governed Taiwan. Beijing sees the island as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. Taiwan's first known settlers were Austronesian tribal people, believed to have come from modern day southern China. Chinese records appear to first mention the island in AD239, when an emperor dispatched an expeditionary force to it - a fact Beijing uses to back its territorial claim. After a relatively brief spell as a Dutch colony, Taiwan was administered by China's Qing dynasty, before it was ceded to Tokyo after Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War. After World War Two, Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China. Afterwards, Taiwan was officially considered occupied by the Republic of China (ROC), which began ruling with the consent of its allies, the US and UK. But in the next few years a civil war broke out in China, and then-leader Chiang Kai-shek's troops were defeated by Mao Zedong's Communist army. Chiang, the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government and their supporters - about 1.5m people -  fled to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang established a dictatorship that ruled Taiwan until the 1980s. Following his death, Taiwan began a transition to democracy and held its first elections in 1996. There is disagreement about the status of Taiwan. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang's ROC government-in-exile at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. But by the 1970s some countries began to argue that the Taipei government could no longer be considered a genuine representative of the people living in mainland China. In 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.  Once China began opening up its economy in 1978, the US recognised opportunities for trade and the need to develop relations. It formally established diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1979. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government has fallen drastically with only 12 countries recognising the island today. China exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan. Relations started improving in the 1980s as Taiwan relaxed rules on visits to and investment in China. In 1991, the ROC proclaimed that the war with the People's Republic of China was over. China proposed the so-called ""one country, two systems"" option, which it said would allow Taiwan significant autonomy if it agreed to come under Beijing's control. This system underpinned Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 and the manner in which it was governed until recently, when Beijing has sought to increase its influence. Taiwan rejected the offer, leading Beijing to insist the Taiwan's ROC government was illegitimate - but unofficial representatives from China and Taiwan still held limited talks. Then in 2000, Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian as president, much to Beijing's alarm. Mr Chen and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had openly backed Taiwan ""independence"". A year after Mr Chen was re-elected in 2004, China passed a so-called anti-secession law, declaring China's right to use ""non-peaceful means"" against Taiwan if it tried to ""secede"" from China. Mr Chen was later succeeded by the KMT, which favours closer relations with the PRC. In 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, from the DPP, was elected to the presidency. Under her, cross-strait relations have soured. China also cut off official communications with Taiwan after Ms Tsai took over, saying it was because of her refusal to endorse the concept of a single Chinese nation. Ms Tsai has never said she will formally declare Taiwan's independence, insisting that it is already independent. And now, relations with China are on the line again - and the world will be watching as Taiwan heads to the polls on 13th January. Many believe the results of the vote will push the island further towards - or away - from Beijing. Most Taiwanese people do not actually support immediate formal independence or unification with the PRC - but support some form of maintaining the status quo. Chinese President Xi has reiterated the message that China will ""surely be reunified"" with Taiwan, and has set 2049 as a target date for ""achieving the Chinese dream"". The US maintains official ties with Beijing, and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" - but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and US President Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily - breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. The island has long been one of the most contentious issue in US-China relations, with Beijing condemning any perceived support from Washington for Taipei. In 2022, after a visit to Taiwan by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi, China responded with an unprecedented show of force, carrying out military exercises around Taiwan in retaliation. Under President Xi, China has ramped up this ""grey zone warfare"" - sending record numbers of Chinese fighter jets near Taiwan and holding military drills in response to political exchanges between the US and Taiwan. In 2022, China's warplane incursions into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) nearly doubled. The results of the elections will shape the course of US-China relations - and no matter who walks away the winner, will have an indelible impact on the delicate relationship between the US, China and Taiwan.",['Taiwan'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0566/production/_105028310_2b415d5f-0c2d-4cf5-91e0-03757db4f1dd.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14907/production/_86513248_taiwan.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1AA8/production/_86542860_f66cb468-70c1-4c09-adbe-c1850adfb74e.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A1A6/production/_105028314_deb2b8ef-22a8-4e0f-8c0c-cda59ce9df4f.jpg']",['N/A'],World,Asia

Poverty is widespread, but Bangladesh has in recent years reduced population growth and improved health and education. Formerly East Pakistan, Bangladesh came into being only in 1971, when the two parts of Pakistan split after a bitter war which drew in neighbouring India. Bangladesh spent 15 years under military rule and, although democracy was restored in 1990, the political scene remains volatile. Islamist extremism has also been rising in the traditionally tolerant country. Bangladesh is low-lying and vulnerable to flooding and cyclones. It stands to be badly affected by any rise in sea levels. President: Mohammed Shahabuddin Mohammed Shahabuddin was elected unopposed in the 2023 presidential election. He was nominated by the ruling Awami League. Before being elected to the largely ceremonial post, he had served as a judge and as a  commissioner of the Anti-Corruption Commission. Prime minister: Sheikh Hasina Sheikh Hasina has secured her fourth straight term as prime minister in a controversial election in January 2024 - she has been prime minister since 1996. Her Awami League party and its allies won 223 of 300 parliamentary seats contested, amid a boycott by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and followed mass arrests of BNP leaders and supporters. Official figures suggested a low voter turnout of about 40%, though critics said even those numbers might have been inflated. In comparison, the last election in 2018 had a voter turnout of more than 80%. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimated that nearly 10,000 activists were arrested after an opposition rally on 28 October 2023 turned violent, resulting in the deaths of at least 16 people and injuring more than 5,500. It accused the government of ""filling prisons with the ruling Awami League's political opponents"". Fears have been raised that this new victory for the Awami League could lead to de-facto one party rule. Few observers expect the government to relax its crackdown - particularly if opposition parties and civil society groups continue to raise questions over the legitimacy of the government. The BNP boycotted the election after the Awami League rejected their demands for an independent caretaker government to preside over the polls. TV is the leading medium. State-run BTV has national terrestrial coverage and privately-owned satellite channels are widely watched. Media tend to be polarised, aligning themselves with one or other of the main political factions.

The announcement comes as Taiwan prepares to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 13 January. US weapons sales to Taiwan are a frequent source of tension between Beijing and Washington. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, a claim Taiwan's government rejects. Last month, the US State Department approved a $300m (£236m) sale of equipment to help maintain Taiwan's tactical information systems. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that the sanctions were ""In response to these gravely wrong actions taken by the US"". It also said the recent arms sales ""seriously harm China's sovereignty and security interests, undermine the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"". The companies being sanctioned were named as BAE Systems Land and Armament, Alliant Techsystems Operation, AeroVironment, ViaSat and Data Link Solutions. China will freeze the assets of the companies and ban people and organisations in China from engaging them, the Foreign Ministry said. The BBC has contacted the US embassy in Beijing for comment. Beijing has ramped up its pressure on Taiwan ahead of the elections that could redefine the island's relationship with China. In his annual New Year's Eve address, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his claim that Taiwan would ""surely be reunified"" with China. He also struck a stronger tone than last year's message, when he spoke about Taiwan being part of the ""same family"". China sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control. Taiwan considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.","['Arms trade', 'Taiwan', 'BAE Systems']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D522/production/_132226545_gettyimages-1246025923.jpg'],['Peter Hoskins'],World,Asia
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59900139,China and Taiwan: A really simple guide,China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island.,2024-01-08,"China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. Taiwan has strong links to China, its biggest trading partner. And many Taiwanese have business and family connections across the strait. But over time, polls show that the number of people who identify as Taiwanese, as opposed to Chinese, has gone up. The island, which is roughly 100 miles from the coast of south-east China, has been home to various indigenous tribes for centuries. Historical sources suggest it first came under the full control of a Chinese empire in the 17th Century. It became a Japanese colony in 1895, after the Qing empire lost the first Sino-Japanese war. Then in 1945, after Japan lost World War Two, China took the island but now a nationalist government, led by General Chiang Kai-shek, was in power. This was at the height of a decades-long conflict between Chiang's forces and Mao Zedong's Communist Party. When the communists won in 1949, Chiang and what was left of the nationalist party, known as the Kuomintang or KMT, fled to Taiwan, where they ruled for several decades. They called this the Republic of China, a name Taiwan has retained. The Chinese Communist Party points to this history to claim Taiwan. But the Taiwanese point to the same history to argue that they were not part of the modern Chinese state that was first formed after the revolution in 1911 - or the People's Republic of China that was established under Mao in 1949. Today, only 12 countries (plus the Vatican) officially recognise Taiwan. The US decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Beijing to Taipei in 1979 was the turning point. And a richer, more powerful China exerts pressure so more countries do not recognise Taiwan or lend it support. But America remains the island's strongest ally, sells arms to it and has vowed to help in case of a Chinese attack. China has spoken of ""peaceful reunification"" - a long-term goal to win over the island's population through soft power and CCP-sponsored messaging that shows unification in a positive light. But Beijing has also used threats. President Xi Jinping has said ""reunification"" with the island must be fulfilled and is believed to have a deadline. In a military confrontation, China's armed forces would dwarf those of Taiwan. China is the second-biggest spender on defence after the US and could draw on a huge range of capabilities, from naval power to missile technology, aircraft and cyber attacks. Some Western experts predict that Taiwan could at best aim to slow a Chinese attack, try to prevent a shore landing by amphibious forces, and mount guerrilla strikes while waiting for outside help. And that help could come from the US. But for decades Washington has walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Taipei - and has been deliberately unclear about whether or how it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack. US-China ties have, however, soured in recent years. And Beijing often accuses the US of reneging on its ""One-China"" policy, which recognises only one Chinese government, in Beijing. But Washington denies this, saying the status quo has not changed. Taiwan sits in the so-called ""first island chain"", which includes a list of US-friendly territories that are crucial to Washington's foreign policy in the region. China's increasingly aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea has also made Taiwan more significant to US calculations. Taiwan's economy is another factor. Much of the world's electronics - from phones to electric cars - are powered by computer chips made in Taiwan. By one measure, a single Taiwanese company - the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC - has over half of the world's market. So if China takes the island, it could be freer to project power in the western Pacific and rival the US. Beijing would also have control over an industry that drive the global economy. But China insists that its intentions are peaceful - and accuses the US of encircling it with military bases that stretch from Australia in the south to Japan in the north.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67914273,Sahra Wagenknecht: German politician launches 'left-wing conservative' party,German politician Sahra Wagenknecht has launched a party which she says will appeal to culturally conservative and economically left-wing voters.,2024-01-08,"German politician Sahra Wagenknecht has launched a party which she says will appeal to culturally conservative and economically left-wing voters. The BSW supports a higher minimum wage as well as an end to net-zero policies and weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Mrs Wagenknecht is one of the best-known figures in German politics and the launch represents a significant change to the political landscape. The 54-year-old said people were losing faith in mainstream parties. She was born in communist East Germany, to a German mother and Iranian father, and joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) in 1989, a few months before the fall of the Berlin Wall. After German reunification, she joined the successor party to the SED, which eventually merged into the left-wing Die Linke. Elected first to the European Parliament and then the Bundestag, the German parliament, she grew increasingly strident in her criticism of immigration, particularly after 2015, when about a million people from Syria and other countries arrived in Germany. ""She established a strong reputation and credibility for her anti-immigration positions and cultural conservatism,"" says Sarah Wagner, a lecturer at Queen's University Belfast. Mrs Wagenknecht's high profile helped her develop personal support, particularly in eastern Germany. In October, she quit Die Linke, saying: ""the way things are going… our country will be unrecognisable in 10 years."" Political scientist Cas Mudde says electoral research shows that there is a ""significant"" electorate with left-wing conservative views. But he adds that ""most of these voters care more about their right-wing cultural views than their left-wing economic views"". The pitch from the BSW - or Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht - will be tested first in the European elections in July. However, three state elections in eastern Germany in September are likely to provide a stronger indication of how the new party will fare. Ms Wagner told the BBC that the emergence of the BSW could tempt voters away from the AfD, jeopardising the far-right party's hopes of coming first in a state election for the first time. ""The AfD is going to be in quite a bit of trouble if this project is successful,"" Ms Wagner says. The far-right party has been hitting record highs in the polls, consistently scoring above some mainstream parties. The BSW has some €1.4m ($1.5m: £1.2m) funding available at launch, according to its treasurer. Parties strongly associated with individuals have a poor record in German politics. In 2000, Ronald Schill, a judge, set up an insurgent party, which garnered significant support in Hamburg before collapsing a few years later. But at least for the foreseeable future, politics in the EU's largest economy looks to be even further fractured, with voters having the choice between an unprecedented eight major parties.",['Germany'],['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3BC7/production/_132230351_a7e97cb3da95f9b900e4e7993c0a150fce77007f.jpg'],['Ido Vock'],World,Europe

There are also reported blockages in Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Bavaria. The subsidy cuts were designed to fix a budget crisis after a court ruled the government's 2024 budget was illegal. But the cuts have backfired and there are fears the ensuing row could feed the far right's popularity. Reacting to the blockades, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned that stopping people from going to work, school or to see a doctor ""will cause anger and disagreement."" But farmers are enraged and their association, DBV, has called on the government to scrap all plans for cutting farmer's subsidies. ""Otherwise the supply of high quality food stuffs is jeopardised,"" warned DBV head Joachim Rukwied in a radio interview. Ministers have been scrambling to plug a financial blackhole of tens of billions of euros after a bombshell ruling in November by Germany's constitutional court, which declared the government's budget illegal. However subsequent proposals to end farmers' tax breaks on agricultural diesel have already been watered down, with the change now set to be phased in over time. The government also dropped plans to abolish preferential treatment in vehicle tax. But it hasn't assuaged farmers' anger and, in heated scenes, a group of protesters even prevented the Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck from disembarking from a ferry last week. The demonstration drew widespread condemnation and sparked fresh fears about the radicalisation of political debate in Germany. But the co-leader of the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Alice Weidel, said that the episode showed that the vice chancellor was ""no longer taken seriously"". ""And instead of seeking dialogue, he'd rather flee on a ferry,"" she wrote. The AfD has been hitting record highs in the polls, consistently scoring above the three governing parties. There are frequent reports of infighting and barely-disguised tensions within Germany's ruling traffic light coalition of Social Democrats, the Greens and Free Democrats. Crucial regional elections later this year will test at least part of the country's mood with three eastern states - Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia - going to the polls. Planned train drivers strikes will also pile further pressure on the coalition later this week. Germany's GDL union said on Sunday that it would call on members to walk out from Wednesday as part of a wage dispute with rail operator Deutsche Bahn. As the tractors pull up in central Berlin, it is an inauspicious start to the year for Chancellor Scholz's government and comes alongside predictions of lacklustre economic growth for a country often described as the EU's ""powerhouse"".","['Alternative for Germany (AfD)', 'Germany']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ED0A/production/_132228606_gettyimages-1916691000.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9594/production/_132229283_45bd9f3440334c03b938f201961368effd58d4e50_0_5114_33881000x662.jpg']","['Jessica Parker', 'Berlin correspondent']",World,Europe

Her resignation comes with President Emmanuel Macron widely expected to reshuffle his top team ahead of European elections due later this year. In a statement, Mr Macron said Ms Borne had shown ""courage, commitment and determination"" during her time in office. It is not yet known who will be appointed as her successor. Ms Borne will remain in post until a new prime minister takes over, a statement from the Élysée Palace said. She was France's second female prime minister and longest serving, outlasting Édith Cresson who served in the role under François Mitterrand from 1991-92. Reports of an overhaul of the government have been rife in recent weeks as Mr Macron looks to boost his political fortunes ahead of June's election and in a year when France will be centre stage when it hosts the Olympic Games. With three years left of his presidency, commentators have said an overhaul is necessary to revive his government's political impetus after a series of protests over controversial policies and legislative defeats. His government  suffered a significant defeat on a key piece of immigration legislation in December, which was widely seen as a moment of crisis. The law eventually passed after concessions were made to right-wing opposition groups but Mr Macron's party is still expected to face a strong challenge in the European poll. Ms Borne's departure will be seen as the beginning of that overhaul, with several key figures in government tipped to replace her. The 34-year-old education minister Gabriel Attal is considered the frontrunner for the job. He would become France's youngest and first openly gay prime minister. Armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu - who at 37, would also be the youngest person to hold the post - and ex-agriculture minister Julien Denormandie have been tipped as potential alternatives. An announcement on a new prime minister is not expected until Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Élysée Palace told the BBC. France's prime minister is expected to manage the day-to-day business of the government and heads the Council of Ministers. Mr Macron's party lost its parliamentary majority in 2022, meaning the new prime minister will face an uphill struggle to turn the President's policies into law. When appointed, the new prime minister will become the fourth to hold office since Mr Macron was first elected as President in 2017.","['Emmanuel Macron', 'France']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1379E/production/_132247797_def0b262138695fa18402f0d077ba533b35d9c1e0_0_5352_35681000x667.jpg'],['Sean Seddon'],World,Europe

Mr Tate is being investigated in the country over allegations of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. On Monday, Bucharest's Court of Appeal ordered a new trial over the held assets, which includes luxury cars. Mr Tate's brother Tristan and two associated companies were also parties to the successful appeal. The brothers appealed a December 2023 court ruling which upheld the legality of the seizure of their assets. A ruling handed down by a higher court on Monday said it overturned the earlier ruling and referred it for a retrial. The decision means the Tate brothers will be able to return to court and mount a new legal effort to reclaim their seized assets. Two companies, SC Ground Breaking Development SRL and The Cannon Run Limited, were listed alongside the Tate brothers as parties in the appeal. In a post on his official Twitter account, Andrew Tate said a court will now have to demonstrate the wealth was acquired illegally in order to justify the ongoing seizure, adding: ""They won't prove a thing because it never happened."" Court documents released in June indicated the brothers had amassed millions of euros and acquired expensive assets and properties via their business activities, which included adult content and online self-help courses. Both Tate brothers deny charges levelled by Romanian investigators that they exploited women via their adult content business, which prosecutors allege operated as a criminal group. Two female Romanian associates were also named alongside the British-American brothers in an indictment published in June, and seven alleged victims were identified. The brothers were first arrested in December 2022 and spent time in prison before being place under house arrest. While they are no long under detention, the brothers are prohibited from leaving Romania while the investigation progresses. In January 2023, expensive cars were seen being removed from a property associated with the Tates near Bucharest. Watches worth millions of euros were also confiscated during the raids.","['Romania', 'Andrew Tate']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13940/production/_132129108_3f89c252109fafb943fa37ac3927b27ba82e0e75.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0509/production/_128298210_annotation2023-01-14143816.jpg']",['Sean Seddon'],World,Europe

Anders Breivik, who killed eight people with a car bomb in Oslo and shot dead 69 people at a summer youth camp, says his conditions breach his human rights. Norway's justice ministry says he must be kept separate from the prison population over security concerns. Breivik's lawyers told a court on Monday the 44-year-old no longer wishes to live. ""He has been isolated for about 12 years... He lives in a completely locked world,"" his lawyer, Oeystein Storrvik, told a court hearing on Monday. ""He does not wish to be alive anymore,"" he added. Breivik is also asking the court to lift restrictions on his correspondence with the outside world. Breivik was sentenced to 21 years - the maximum penalty a court in Norway can impose, though it can be extended for as long as he is deemed a threat - for carrying out the attacks on 22 July 2011. He has challenged the terms of his sentence before, winning part of his human rights case against the Norwegian state in 2016 before it was overturned the following year. The 44-year-old currently spends his time in a dedicated section of Ringerike prison - located on the shores of the lake that surrounds the island of Utoeya, where he shot dead 69 people. Many of those killed on Utoeya were teenagers involved with the Norwegian Labour Party's youth wing, the AUF. The attacks remain Norway's worst peacetime atrocity. At the prison, Breivik has access to a training room, kitchen, TV room and a bathroom, which pictures from a visit last month by Norwegian news agency NTB showed. Lawyers for the justice ministry argue Breivik enjoys ""a wide range of activities"" such as cooking, games, walks, basketball and studies. They also say his isolation is ""relative"" as he has contact with guards, a priest, health professionals and, until recently, a volunteer who Breivik no longer wishes to see. He also sees two inmates for an hour every other week, the lawyers said. ""An extraordinarily dangerous inmate requires extraordinary measures,"" Andreas Hjetland told the court on Monday. ""He is still proud of what he has done. He still holds the same ideological views,"" Hjetland said. The judge will deliver a verdict in the coming weeks. There is no jury. Ingrid Kragh Swang, whose eldest son survived the attack on Utoeya, told Norweigan broadcaster NRK she was ""sick and tired of this being brought up again and again"". ""It wears us down and tears something up in us,"" she added. Breivik unsuccessfully applied for parole in 2022, with the court ruling he had not changed and remained a risk to society.","['Norway', 'Anders Behring Breivik']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14AFE/production/_132243748_andersbreivik.png'],['James Gregory'],World,Europe
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17907947,Serbia country profile,Serbia became a stand-alone sovereign republic in the summer of 2006 after Montenegro voted in a referendum for independence from the Union of Serbia and Montenegro.,2024-01-08,"Serbia became a stand-alone sovereign republic in the summer of 2006 after Montenegro voted in a referendum for independence from the Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The end of the Union marked the closing chapter in the separation of the six republics of the old Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, which was proclaimed in 1945 and comprised Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. Yugoslavia's communist leader, Josip Broz Tito, kept the lid on ethnic tensions. The federation lasted for over 10 years after his death in 1980, but under Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic it fell apart through the 1990s. The secession of Slovenia and Macedonia came relatively peacefully, but there were devastating wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia and Montenegro together formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2003 before forming a looser union. In 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence. In recent years the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has steadily eroded political rights and civil liberties, putting pressure on independent media, the political opposition, and civil society organizations, says the democracy advocacy group Freedom House. President: Aleksandar Vucic President Aleksandar Vucic claimed a re-election victory in the country's snap December 2023 elections, with his Serbian Progressive Party, or SNS, winning some 47% of the vote. Opposition parties under the Serbia Against Violence (SPN) banner were well behind with around 23%. The vote was almost immediately marred by accusations of irregularities. The International Election Observation Mission said in a statement that ""serious irregularities, including vote-buying and ballot box stuffing were observed"". The SNS has been in power since 2012 but there have been three elections  since 2020. Opposition figures accused the SNS of using public resources for political purposes and election monitor CRTA complained before the vote of a ""chronic lack of pluralism"" in Serbia. In 2021, Amnesty International characterised his mandate as one of human rights violations, restrictions on freedom of expression and campaigns of harassment against the opposition figures, journalists and media outlets. Serbia is a candidate to become a member of the European Union, and President Vucic is under pressure from both the EU and the US to normalise relations with Kosovo. Kosovo declared unilateral independence from Serbia in 2008, and while it is recognised by more than 100 UN members, Serbia has refused to do so - backed by allies like Russia, China and five EU members. Prime minister: Ana Brnabic Ana Brnabic made history as the first female and first openly gay prime minister of Serbia when she took office in June 2017. Ms Brnabic is non-party, and has a background in local government development. She has described herself as a pro-European and technocratic prime minister. Some critics have argued that it is Vukic, as president, who wields effective power in Serbia. Television is, by far, the main source of news and information. The flagship public network, RTS1, is among a handful of outlets that dominate the market. There are more than 90 TV channels and the average viewer spends more than five hours a day watching television, the highest figure in Europe. Six TV stations are licensed to broadcast nationally: 30 have regional licences. The national TV broadcasters attract around 70% of the audience. RTS1 is the most popular channel in Serbia, attracting up to a quarter of the audience and providing strong competition for commercial stations, including leading commercial network TV Pink. Some key dates in Serbia's history: 1389 - Serb nobility decimated in battle of Kosovo Polje as Ottoman Empire expands. 15th - 18th Centuries - Serbia absorbed by Ottoman Empire. 1817 - Serbia becomes autonomous principality. 1878 - Serbian independence recognised by international treaties. 1918 - Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes - later Yugoslavia - formed after World War One. 1945 - Together with Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro, Serbia becomes one of republics in new Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito. 1980 - Tito dies. 1989 - Slobodan Milosevic becomes President of Serbia. 1991 - Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia break away from Yugoslavia. 1992 - Montenegro and Serbia form Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Rising nationalist and independence aspirations bring bloody conflict with Croats and Bosnian Muslims. UN imposes sanctions. 1995 - Dayton accords bring end to Bosnian war.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67912235,Adolfo Macías Villamar: Curfew in Ecuador after infamous gang leader 'Fito' vanishes from cell,A 60-day state of emergency has begun in Ecuador after a convicted gang leader vanished from his prison cell.,2024-01-08,"A 60-day state of emergency has begun in Ecuador after a convicted gang leader vanished from his prison cell. Adolfo Macías Villamar, better known as ""Fito"", is the leader of Los Choneros, a powerful gang which is thought to have been behind some of the deadly prison riots in recent months. He was being held in the maximum security wing of a jail in Guayaquil. The emergency measures include the suspension of the right of assembly and a nightly curfew. They were announced in a decree issued by President Daniel Noboa, who took office less than two months ago as the second-youngest holder of the post in Ecuadorean history. He won the election after a campaign overshadowed by unprecedented levels of violence, including the assassination of another candidate, Fernando Villavicencio. President Noboa said the emergency would allow the military and police to take control of the country's prisons at a national level. Los Choneros control much of the compound at La Regional prison, where Fito was being held. ""These narco-terrorist groups intend to intimidate us and they think we will give in to their demands,"" the president said. But he added: ""We will not negotiate with terrorists and we will not rest until we have restored peace."" Fito is a notorious criminal suspected of having played a role in last year's killing of Villavicencio, whom he had sent death threats. Police said they had noticed his absence early on Sunday and could not find him anywhere in the prison wing. He often defies the authorities, most recently by releasing a ""narcocorrido"", a slick music video glorifying his criminal exploits, which was partly recorded inside the jail. The video shows the Mariachi Bravo duo singing along with Fito's daughter, known as Queen Michelle, and praising the ""man of honour"" they say the criminal is. ""I take my hat off to you, Fito, my dad,"" his daughter croons, claiming that ""through his veins good blood flows"". The video shows Fito caressing a fighting cockerel and freely chatting to fellow inmates. The fact that the video could be recorded behind bars suggests that the ban on electronic devices inside the jail had been breached. It is still not clear if Fito managed to leave the prison compound in the port city or if he may be hiding somewhere inside. A police commander said he could ""neither confirm nor deny"" an escape, nor could he say for how long the convict had been missing. He said hundreds of officers were searching the prison. La Regional jail is located in a large prison compound which houses a total of five penitentiaries and more than 12,000 inmates. Fito has spent much of his past 12 years behind bars there. In August, he was briefly transferred to La Roca, a smaller jail in the same compound, which is considered safer because of the lower number of inmates. It took thousands of soldiers to move him. But the convict's lawyer appealed against the decision to transfer him and won, and Fito was moved back to La Regional after just a month. Fito has escaped from the prison compound before. In 2013, he and 17 other inmates broke out of La Roca and fled in boats on the River Daule, which borders the compound. The fugitive was captured along with his brother, a fellow member of Los Choneros, four months later at their mother's home in the city of Manta. Fito has been in prison ever since. After the killing in December 2020 of the Jorge Luis Zambrano, he took over the leadership of Los Choneros. The gang, which is named after its power base in the town of Chone, mainly engages in drug trafficking and extortion and has forged links with Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel.","['Ecuador', 'Prison escapes']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B2E0/production/_132229754_e1df984390b4288f72f57d2e93d2c8d56f5c03e90_0_3801_21391000x563.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12810/production/_132229757_gettyimages-1599149353.jpg']","['Vanessa Buschschlüter', 'Robert Plummer']",World,Latin America

Sheldon Morfoot, 31, from west Cumbria, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis last year. He spent £50,000 travelling to Mexico for treatments which should help halt the progress of his symptoms. He initially borrowed the money and his friends have been helping him pay it back. Mr Morfoot, from Thornhill, near Egremont, was told last August that he had developed the same condition which claimed the life of his mother in 2015. He began to research potential treatments and travelled to a clinic in Mexico for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation late last year. The procedure is designed to reset the immune system and stop it attacking the central nervous system using stem cells taken from the patient's own bone marrow. Mr Morfoot, who spent 28 days in Mexico, said the same treatment was only available under the NHS to patients who meet certain requirements. He said he wanted the treatment quickly. ""It stops the progression dead, but it won't reverse symptoms,"" he said, adding: ""The quicker you go, with no disability, the better you're going to be."" Initially Mr Morfoot borrowed the money to get to Mexico, promising friends and family he would pay them back, including by selling his house in Thornhill which will soon go on the market. But friends have also launched fundraising campaigns to help him. Last week, some of them completed the Dave Goggins challenge in Egremont, running four miles every four hours for two days, contributing at least £5,000 to a total fundraising effort which now stands at £25,000. ""I have no words for what friends have done for me,"" Mr Morfoot said. ""The amount of support I've had is ridiculous, I cannot thank them enough."" It will be a few months before Mr Morfoot, a Sellafield motor mechanic, will discover if the treatment has worked, but he remains optimistic. ""I've got that glimmer of hope, haven't I? ""I've got MS, and I'll always have MS, but if this is stopped for five years, 10 years, that's a winner in my eyes,"" he said. Follow BBC Cumbria on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67914727,Suspected Israeli strike in Lebanon kills senior Hezbollah commander,The Lebanese group Hezbollah says one of its commanders has been killed in a strike in southern Lebanon believed to have been carried out by Israel.,2024-01-08,"The Lebanese group Hezbollah says one of its commanders has been killed in a strike in southern Lebanon believed to have been carried out by Israel. Wissam Tawil was reportedly a member of the group's elite Radwan Force, and one of the most prominent Hezbollah figures to be killed in the current violence. Israel's military did not comment, but it did say it had hit Hezbollah targets in response to cross-border attacks. The clashes have raised fears of a wider regional conflict. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed group that wields considerable military and political power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers. Its fighters have exchanged fire with Israeli forces almost every day along the border since the start of the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip on 7 October. Israel's prime minister told soldiers stationed on the border with Lebanon on Monday that he was determined to ""do everything necessary to restore security to the north"". Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that two people - whom it did not name - were killed in an Israeli air strike that targeted a car in the al-Dabsha area of Khirbet Selim at around 10:15 (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The strike caused the vehicle to veer off the road and catch fire, it added. Pictures from the scene showed the burned-out wreck of a car on a roadside. Lebanese security sources said one of those killed in the strike was Wissam Tawil and that the other was also a Hezbollah fighter. Three sources told Reuters news agency that Tawil was the deputy head of a unit within Hezbollah's Radwan Force, whose well-trained members are considered the group's special forces. AFP news agency meanwhile cited another source as saying that Tawil ""had a leading role in managing Hezbollah's operations in the south"" of Lebanon. Later, Hezbollah issued a statement announcing Tawil's death and describing him as a ""commander"". It did not confirm that he was killed in a strike, saying only that he ""rose as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem"". The statement provided no details about Tawil's role in Hezbollah, but the group published photos showing him shaking hands with its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and sitting next the late Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US strike in Iraq in 2020. The group also announced that its fighters had fired at Israeli forces in the Shtoula area of northern Israel and in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area in the occupied Golan Heights. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it would not comment on foreign media reports about Tawil's death. However, not long after the incident in Khirbet Selim it put out a statement saying that it ""struck a number of areas in Lebanese territory"" after an anti-tank missile was launched towards the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. ""Additionally, [Israeli Air Force] fighter jets struck a series of Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon, including military sites in which Hezbollah terrorists operated,"" it added. On Monday afternoon, the IDF said a jet carried out another series of strikes after an aerial defence array intercepted a ""suspicious aerial target"" that crossed from Lebanon, triggering sirens in the Kfar Blum area. An Israeli soldier was also lightly injured by an anti-tank missile that was fired towards Mount Dov, it added. Over the weekend, the IDF's chief spokesman said it had targeted significant military assets of Hezbollah and carried out ""damaging"" strikes on the Radwan Force in an effort to drive them away from the border. It came after a rocket and missile barrage launched from Lebanon damaged an air traffic control base on Mount Meron. The cross-border violence over the past three months has already killed dozens of Hezbollah fighters, as well as several Israeli soldiers and Israeli and Lebanese civilians. But so far, Hezbollah has calibrated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel. Last week, reacting to a suspected Israeli strike that killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri and six other people in Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut, Hassan Nasrallah warned Israeli authorities against starting a conflict. ""Whoever thinks of war with us... he will regret it,"" he said. However, crucially, there was no threat from Hezbollah's leader to escalate its actions. Many in Lebanon still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 and, with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is no public support for any military confrontation. Miscalculation, however, is always a risk. And, in Israel, some senior figures have touted a potential larger offensive against Hezbollah to reduce the threat posed by the group and allow the return of thousands of residents who have been evacuated because of constant attacks. ""We'll create a completely different reality [in the north], or we'll get to another war,"" IDF chief of staff Lt Gen Herzl Halevi said on Sunday. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told soldiers at a base in Kiryat Shmona that he wanted to ""send a message to Hezbollah"". ""Hezbollah made a big mistake with us in 2006 and it is also doing so now. It thought that we were like 'spider's cobwebs'. Suddenly, it sees what kind of 'spider'. It sees great force here, the unity of the people, the determination to do everything necessary to restore security to the north,"" he said. ""Of course, we prefer that this be done without a wide-ranging campaign, but that will not stop us,"" he added. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who has been meeting Arab leaders on his latest regional tour, has been trying to de-escalate tensions. He is also expected to call for Israel to reduce the intensity of its fighting in Gaza amid reports of dozens of Palestinians killed in the latest air strikes.","['Israel-Gaza war', 'Lebanon', 'Hezbollah', 'Israel']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E8F3/production/_132253695_mediaitem132253694.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/129D5/production/_132254267_israel_lebanon_map_v5_2x640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16CA1/production/_132254339_gettyimages-1899081081.jpg']","['Hugo Bachega', 'David Gritten']",World,Middle East
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67911825,Antony Blinken: On the US mission to stop Gaza igniting wider war,"Of all the priorities for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his fourth visit to the Middle East in three months, there is one message above all others that he wants to deliver.",2024-01-08,"Of all the priorities for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on his fourth visit to the Middle East in three months, there is one message above all others that he wants to deliver. His main mission on this trip is to ensure the Israel-Gaza war does not spread into a regional conflict. As he flies between destinations in southwest Asia - a packed schedule that includes stops in Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Israel - there is ample evidence, however, that the cauldron of tensions in the region is on the verge of boiling over. Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched repeated missile and drone attacks on civilian shipping in the Red Sea, bringing traffic through that key international waterway to a near halt. The US has warned that it will defend its interests. If the rebels persist, and the disruption to global commerce continues, an American military response may be inevitable - a development that would unnerve some key American Arab allies. ""We never see a military action as a resolution,"" said the Qatari prime minister in a joint press conference with Mr Blinken in Doha on Sunday. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said his biggest worry was that such action would ""keep us in a loop that will never end and will create a real tension in the entire region"". On Saturday, Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon fired a barrage of rocket attacks on northern Israel in reprisal for what appeared to be an Israeli-planned bomb attack that killed a key Hamas leader in Beirut. Israel responded with air strikes targeting Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. An escalation there, Mr Blinken said later that day, was a ""real concern"". He called on regional powers with influence over Hezbollah - in other words Iran and, to a lesser extent, Turkey - to use their influence to ""try to keep things in check"". That may be difficult. As the Washington Post reported, American officials are concerned that Israel may be considering a more expansive offensive against Hezbollah. ""We prefer the path of an agreed-upon diplomatic settlement, but we are getting close to the point where the hourglass will turn over,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Friday. Meanwhile, US military installations have been hit by rocket and drone attacks from militants in Iraq and Syria, where more than 3,000 American soldiers are stationed. In late October, a drone breached US defences and struck a barracks but did not detonate, according to a Reuters report, narrowly avoiding what might have been significant American casualties. The US has responded with military action, including an air strike in Baghdad last week that killed Mushtaq Taleb al-Saidi, an Iran-backed militia leader. Each of these episodes, taken individually, presents a threat to regional stability. When viewed as a whole, it suggests a Middle East teetering on the brink of wider war. In Qatar on Sunday, Mr Blinken said the US has a plan to address the growing instability - and it hinges on winding down the Israeli military campaign in Gaza and working with Arab nations and the Israelis to establish a ""durable"" peace for the Palestinians. ""The United States has a vision for how to get there, a regional approach that delivers lasting security for Israel and a state for the Palestinian people,"" he said. ""And my takeaway from the discussions so far ... is that our partners are willing to have these difficult conversations and to make hard decisions."" Therein lies the rub. After meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, Mr Blinken said he's seen a willingness to help stabilise and revitalise a post-war Gaza among all the leaders he's spoken with so far. But the US has to get Israel on board. The timing of Mr Blinken's latest Middle East trip may give hints of the American strategy in this latest round of shuttle diplomacy. His early visits to Turkey and Arab nations before two days in Israel have allowed the secretary to take the temperature of regional players before sitting down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet. Then the ball, as Americans like to say, is in the Israeli court. ""I'll have an opportunity to share with Israeli leaders everything I've heard thus far on this trip,"" he said on Monday. ""I'm convinced that there is a future path that can actually bring lasting peace and security for Israel."" Behind all this is an American gamble - that resolving, or at least winding down, the Gaza War will cool tensions throughout the region. It is a bet that the various mini-crises - in the Red Sea, in Lebanon, and in Iraq and Syria - have not taken on a momentum of their own. There is no peace in the region without a legitimate, peaceful solution to the Palestinian conflict, the Qatari prime minister said on Sunday. The question is, will there be peace with such a resolution? During his November trip to the Middle East, Mr Blinken told reporters gathered on the tarmac in Ankara, Turkey, that countries across the region do not want war - and are working to prevent the conflict from spreading. ""Sometimes the absence of something bad happening may not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is,"" the US secretary said. Since then, there has been ample evidence that while a wider war may not be wanted, the prospects for one has increased - despite the stated intentions and efforts of Mr Blinken and the Americans.","['Antony Blinken', 'United States', 'Qatar', 'United Arab Emirates']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4710/production/_132229181_blinken_976getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/929F/production/_132253573_houthis_976getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/447F/production/_132253571_funeral_976.jpg']",['Anthony Zurcher'],World,Middle East

Inspections began after a section of the fuselage fell from an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 on Friday. United Airlines said ""installation issues"" relating to door plugs would be ""remedied"" before the aircraft type would return to service. Some 171 planes of the same type remain grounded by the US regulator. In its statement, United said: ""Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug - for example, bolts that needed additional tightening."" The door plug is a piece of fuselage with a window that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. It was this part of the Alaska Airlines plane which dramatically fell off mid-flight over the US state of Oregon, eventually landing in a teacher's back garden. The plane made an emergency landing and none of the passengers were injured. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s used in the US are operated by United Airlines and Alaska, while Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico have also grounded jets of the same model for inspections. United said it had cancelled 200 flights as of Monday and expected significant cancellations on Tuesday. ""We have been able to operate some planned flights by switching to other aircraft types, avoiding about 30 cancellations each on Monday and Tuesday,"" United added. Meanwhile on Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which regulates air travel in the US, said it had provided a checklist for operators to adhere to during inspections. In a statement, the FAA said all 737 Max 9 aircraft would remain grounded until operators ""complete enhanced inspections which include both left and right cabin door exit plugs, door components, and fasteners"". ""Operators must also complete corrective action requirements based on findings from the inspections prior to bringing any aircraft back into service,"" the statement added. Flight 1282 reached 16,000ft (4.8km) when it began its emergency descent on Friday evening, according to flight tracking data. Images shared online - and later by investigators - showed a wide hole in the side of the craft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. Passengers were quoted by The Oregonian newspaper as saying that a young boy seated near the affected area had his shirt ripped off by the force of the decompression. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is leading an investigation into the incident, said pilots had reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made by the specific Alaska Airlines Max 9 involved in the incident. The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water so that the plane ""could return very quickly to an airport"" in the event the warnings happened again, NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy said. It is not clear if there is a link between the issues that led to those warnings, and the issue that caused the blowout on 5 January. Alaska Airlines said in its most recent statement: ""While we await the airworthiness directive (AD) inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections of the mid exit door plugs on our 737-9 Max fleet. ""The 737-9 Max grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have cancelled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected."" Boeing said in a statement: ""Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers."" The company's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues. In late 2018 and early 2019, two of its aircraft were lost in near identical incidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots.","['United Airlines', 'United States', 'Boeing']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BE7/production/_132255279_gdwafwjaqaedplt-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/71CF/production/_132253192_alaska_door_diagram_640-nc-2x-nc.png']",['James Gregory'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67913855,Lloyd Austin: Scrutiny grows on US defence secretary over hospital secrecy,"Criticism of US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is growing, after it emerged his deputy was unaware that he was in hospital despite assuming some of his responsibilities.",2024-01-08,"Criticism of US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is growing, after it emerged his deputy was unaware that he was in hospital despite assuming some of his responsibilities. Kathleen Hicks was not informed until 4 January that Mr Austin was in intensive care, four days after he entered hospital, US media reported. Mr Austin, 70, resumed his full duties on Friday evening, the Pentagon said. But questions are swirling around the secrecy of his medical situation. The defence secretary sits just below the president in the chain of command for the US military and the Pentagon's failure to disclose Mr Austin's illness has raised concerns about a lack of transparency. For three days, senior defence officials and even the White House were not aware of Mr Austin's hospital visit. Members of both parties have expressed alarm over the secrecy of the hospital stay, but the Biden administration has so far backed Mr Austin. The White House on Monday said it would review what happened with the communications process. ""We'll do what's akin to a hot wash and try to see if processes and procedures need to be changed at all or modified so that we can learn from this,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. President Joe Biden, who spoke with Mr Austin on Saturday, has ""no plans for anything other than Secretary Austin to stay in the job"", Mr Kirby also told reporters. ""The president's number one focus is on his health and recovery, and he's looking forward to having him back at the Pentagon as soon as possible,"" he said. Defence officials also told US media that notifications were delayed because Mr Austin's chief of staff was out sick. On Sunday, a Pentagon spokesman revealed Mr Austin had undergone an elective medical procedure on 22 December and returned home the next day. But he began experiencing ""severe pain"" on the evening of 1 January and was admitted to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington DC, Air Force Maj Gen Pat Ryder said. Mr Ryder added that the defence secretary's medical needs required a stay in the intensive care unit and he ""then remained in that location in part due to hospital space considerations and privacy"". Even as he assumes his full duties, Mr Austin is believed to still be at Walter Reed and officials have not disclosed when he will be discharged. In a statement on Saturday, he said: ""I am very glad to be on the mend and look forward to returning to the Pentagon soon. ""I recognise I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better,"" he added. ""But this is important to say: this was my medical procedure, and I take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure."" The failure to notify key officials within the chain of command, however, has drawn increasing scrutiny. The United States has a civilian controlled military, and while the president is the commander in chief, his secretary of defence sits directly below him in the chain of command for the military. The armed forces take their direction from their political masters, and they need to know who is and who is not running things at any one time. NSC spokesperson John Kirby has told reporters there was an expectation that ""any hospitalisation"" would be notified up the chain of command, and not informing the White House for three days is clearly not timely. Officials told CNN that Kathleen Hicks, the Pentagon's second-in-command, began assuming some of her boss's responsibilities last Monday but was in the dark about her boss's whereabouts until Thursday. Mr Ryder has said that Mr Austin's chief of staff Kelly Magsamen was ill and ""unable to make notifications before then"". ""She made those notifications on Thursday to the deputy secretary and national security adviser,"" he said. He told CNN that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had been notified on Tuesday. Gen CQ Brown, however, is a subordinate advisor who does not fall in the chain of command. Military service secretaries who sit in the chain of command were not notified until Friday, Mr Ryder conceded. Leading Republicans and senior Democrats, including some allies of the administration, have expressed alarm over the incident. ""The most disturbing thing I heard is that neither President Biden nor members of the National Security Council were informed he was hospitalised until Thursday,"" Leon Panetta, who served as defence secretary in the Obama administration, told CNN on Sunday. ""That's not acceptable. We've got to be able to make sure that the chain of command remains solid and people responsible for protecting our national defence are in place."" Democratic Congressman Adam Smith, the ranking member of the House armed services committee, wrote in a joint statement with a Republican colleagues that Mr Austin must provide ""additional details on his health and the decision-making process that occurred in the past week as soon as possible"". Some Republicans have called for Mr Austin to be sacked. Former President Donald Trump said the secretary ""should be fired immediately for improper professional conduct and dereliction of duty"", while Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton called for ""consequences for this shocking breakdown"". Off the record assurances that Mr Biden isn't considering firing Mr Austin will do little to quiet the questions over what is undoubtedly a serious lapse in judgement. Pressure will now grow on the secretary of defence to disclose more about his health problems and whether he is up to a demanding role, which sees the US deeply involved in two current theatres of conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine.","['United States', 'US Armed Forces']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/172E/production/_132243950_gettyimages-1857842179-1.jpg'],"['Sam Cabral', 'Gary O’Donoghue']",World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67916669,Trump moves to dismiss Georgia election case,"Donald Trump has asked a Georgia judge to throw out the election fraud case against him, arguing that he is protected by presidential immunity.",2024-01-08,"Donald Trump has asked a Georgia judge to throw out the election fraud case against him, arguing that he is protected by presidential immunity. Mr Trump is among 19 people charged with a conspiracy to overturn the state's 2020 election results. But his lawyers said ""no President ever faced criminal prosecution for acts committed while in office"". If the judge accepts the claim, it would mark a massive expansion of the president's powers of immunity. ""From 1789 to 2023, no President ever faced criminal prosecution for acts committed while in office,"" Mr Trump's lawyers wrote in the Monday filing. ""That unbroken historic tradition of presidential immunity is rooted in the separation of powers and the text of the Constitution."" On Tuesday, a federal appeals court hearing in DC will hear arguments over the same presidential immunity claims as Mr Trump tries to throw out a separate election interference case brought forward by special counsel Jack Smith. Mr Trump is expected to attend the hearing before the three judge panel. The former president has for years cited presidential immunity in his efforts to thwart civil and criminal cases brought against him. But this defence was already ""convincingly and comprehensively"" rejected by US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in December, University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias told the BBC. Ms Chutkan wrote that the presidency does not ""confer a lifelong 'get-out-of-jail-free' pass"" on past holders of the office. Mr Trump's lawyers also argued the Georgia criminal case should be tossed out on grounds of double jeopardy - that he was already tried and acquitted on similar charges in the US Senate following the Capitol riot in 2021. Finally, in a separate motion, Mr Trump's lawyers argued that the case violates his due process and First Amendment rights. ""President Trump did not have fair warning that his alleged conduct, pure political speech and expressive conduct challenging an election, could be criminalized,"" the filing says. Georgia's Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis brought the charges against Mr Trump and 18 others last year, in a 41-count indictment for alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. Mr Trump was charged with 13 criminal counts including an alleged violation of Georgia's Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico). His other charges include solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiring to commit impersonating a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery, conspiring to commit false statements, and writing and conspiring to file false documents. Prosecutors have suggested an August 2024 trial date, which would disrupt Mr Trump's general campaign if he is chosen as the Republican presidential nominee. Four of Mr Trump's co-accused have pleaded guilty in the case.","['United States', 'Indictments of Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/75C1/production/_132254103_gettyimages-1913446477.jpg'],['Chloe Kim'],World,US & Canada

Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic says its Peregrine spacecraft has a faulty propulsion system that's lost ""critical"" amounts of fuel. The issue has already made it difficult for the craft to point its solar panels at the Sun to generate electricity and may now scupper the planned touch-down. Astrobotic has begun talking about reassessing its mission goals. In other words, it's thinking about what can be salvaged from its original objectives. The 1.2-tonne lander was launched early on Monday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a Vulcan rocket. Its aim was to become the first American mission in half a century to make a controlled landing on the Moon and the first ever commercial endeavour to achieve the feat. The US space agency (Nasa) had purchased capacity on the lander for five instruments to study the lunar surface environment ahead of sending astronauts there later this decade. Peregrine's problems emerged shortly after communications had been established with ground controllers, following its release from the top of the Vulcan. Engineers noticed the spacecraft was struggling to maintain a stable lock on the Sun, meaning its solar cells were not receiving a constant supply of sunshine to recharge the onboard battery. Power levels were reported to be reaching operationally low levels. Astrobotic's engineers eventually identified the root cause as a failure in the propulsion system, a situation apparently confirmed by a picture from the craft showing disturbed layers of insulation. And although they were able to successfully re-point the spacecraft and charge the battery, it was evident, the company said, that Peregrine was losing propellant. ""The team is working to try and stabilise this loss, but given the situation we have prioritised maximising the science and data we can capture,"" a statement read. ""We are currently assessing what alternative mission profiles may be feasible at this time."" Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander to the Moon this year under a new private-public partnership with Nasa. The agency is buying transport services from the Pittsburgh firm and two other commercial ventures - Intuitive Machines and Firefly. Together, the trio had planned six missions to the lunar surface in 2024. All three US companies have Nasa as a ""customer"", but the agency is ""not in charge"" of their projects. It is the firms themselves who have designed the spacecraft and are in command as the missions progress. Nasa believes this arrangement will introduce more innovation and reduce costs over time. And the agency says it is prepared for some of the missions not to work. Speaking to the BBC last month, deputy administrator Pam Melroy, said: ""What we have learned from our commercial partners is if we have a high enough cadence, we can relax some of the requirements that make it so costly, and have a higher risk appetite. And if they fail, the next one is going to learn and succeed.""","['Space exploration', 'Pittsburgh', 'Exploration of the Moon', 'Nasa', 'The Moon']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F0C9/production/_132214616_screenshot2024-01-05at14.20.45.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11017/production/_132255696_gdwxnh7wyaayrnm.jpg']",['Jonathan Amos'],World,US & Canada

Monday's vote to oust him was held in private, and was overwhelmingly against keeping him on, according to US media. Mr Ziegler is accused of raping a woman with whom he and his wife had a prior consensual sexual relationship. He has not been charged with a crime, denies rape allegations and had refused to resign despite pressure from allies. ""I believe it was almost unanimous vote to remove Christian Ziegler, which I believe is the absolute right thing to do,"" a source who attended the meeting on Monday in Tallahassee told NBC News. ""And I want to reiterate that we are spending a lot of time and energy on this, on this meeting instead of focusing on the things we need to focus on, and that's simply because Christian Ziegler did not do the right thing and resign."" At an emergency meeting in December, the Republican board voted to strip Mr Ziegler - who took up the post in February 2023- of his pay and authority. The Sarasota Police Department in Florida is investigating a woman's accusations that Mr Ziegler raped her at her apartment in October. According to heavily redacted police documents, Mr Ziegler, his wife, Bridget Ziegler and the woman had planned a threesome that day, but Mrs Ziegler was unable to attend. Mr Ziegler arrived alone, the complaint alleges, and assaulted the woman. Last week, police expanded their probe to include allegations that he illegally recorded his sexual encounter with his accuser without consent. An investigation is ongoing. No charges have been filed against Mr Ziegler, who has said the encounter was consensual. He did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The accusation has brought a rapid fall from grace for the Zieglers, a conservative Florida power couple with growing political influence on the national stage. Bridget Ziegler, an elected member of the Sarasota County School Board, is co-founder of Moms for Liberty, a national right-wing advocacy group born out of a resistance to Covid-19 school closures and mask mandates. She has resisted calls to resign, fielding criticism from many who cast Mrs Ziegler - who with her husband has promoted anti-LGBT policies - as a hypocrite. State Republicans in Michigan over the weekend also voted to oust their party chairwoman, Kristina Karamo, due to claims of poor fundraising.","['Florida', 'United States', 'Republican Party']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/12B3/production/_132078740_gettyimages-1813811822.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F4DF/production/_132078626_gettyimages-1845892610.jpg']",['Max Matza'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67899304,Actor Jonathan Majors says he was 'shocked' by assault verdict,"Jonathan Majors was ""shocked"" after he was found guilty of assaulting his former girlfriend, he said in his first interview since his conviction.",2024-01-08,"Jonathan Majors was ""shocked"" after he was found guilty of assaulting his former girlfriend, he said in his first interview since his conviction. The actor is awaiting sentencing after a New York jury last month convicted him of attacking British choreographer Grace Jabbari. He told ABC News that the incident has been ""confusing in many ways"". ""I'm standing there and the verdict comes down. I say ... 'How is that possible?"" he said. ""Based off the evidence, based off the prosecution's evidence, let alone our evidence, how is that possible?"" he told the Good Morning America programme in an interview that aired on Monday. Majors said he plans to appeal his conviction on one count of third-degree assault and another count of second-degree harassment. He was acquitted of two other counts of assault and aggravated harassment in a split verdict. After the conviction, the Emmy-nominated actor was dropped by Marvel Studios, where he had starred in several films and TV series. He could face up to a year in prison when sentenced in February. The crime took place when Majors and Ms Jabbari were in a car in New York and she saw a text message from another woman on Majors' phone, which said: ""Wish I was kissing you right now."" Prosecutors say that when she took the phone, Majors grabbed her, twisted her arm behind her back and hit her in the head to get it back. Ms Jabbari was left with a fractured finger, bruising and a cut behind her ear. Majors has denied assaulting Ms Jabbari and filed charges against her, claiming she was the one who assaulted him. Prosecutors said the case lacked merit. Majors told ABC that he did not know how Ms Jabbari was harmed in the incident. ""I wish to God I knew. That would give clarity. That would give me some type of peace about it,"" he said. He claimed he has never hit a woman. ""I'm an athlete. I'm a sportsman. I know my body. I know how it moves. I know my strength, or lack thereof, you know? None of that was employed on her,"" he said. In a statement to US media, Ms Jabbari's lawyer said Majors continues to ""take no accountability for his actions"". ""The timing of these new statements demonstrates a clear lack of remorse for the actions for which he was found guilty and should make the sentencing decisions fairly easy for the Court,"" lawyer Brittany Henderson said. During the interview, Majors cried as he spoke about no longer being able to see his daughter because of the conviction. He also said that the ""world stopped"" when Marvel dropped him as an actor. He had been set to reprise his role in Avengers: Kang Dynasty. ""It's like you work so hard for things. And then, you know, it's done,"" Majors said. But he added that he believed he would eventually be back to work in Hollywood. ""I pray that I do,"" he said.","['United States', 'New York']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C275/production/_132218794_gettyimages-1858246666.jpg'],['N/A'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67909417,Alaska Airlines plane had warnings days before mid-air blowout,"Alaska Airlines placed restrictions on the Boeing plane involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout after pressurisation warnings in the days before Friday's incident, investigators say.",2024-01-08,"Alaska Airlines placed restrictions on the Boeing plane involved in a dramatic mid-air blowout after pressurisation warnings in the days before Friday's incident, investigators say. The jet had been prevented from making long-haul flights over water, said Jennifer Homendy of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB also says the missing section of plane has now been found - in the back garden of a Portland teacher. No-one was hurt in Friday's drama. After losing part of its fuselage, the plane - a Boeing 737 Max 9 - made a safe emergency landing after returning to its departure city, Portland. There were 177 passengers and crew on board the flight to Ontario, California. Some 171 planes of the same type remain grounded by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as safety checks continue. Before Saturday's intervention by the FAA, Alaska Airlines briefly returned some of its Max 9s to service, saying it had made ""no concerning findings"". Speaking at a news conference, Ms Homendy said pilots reported pressurisation warning lights on three previous flights made by the specific Alaska Airlines Max 9 involved in the incident. The decision to restrict lengthy flights over water was so that the plane ""could return very quickly to an airport"" in the event the warnings happened again, the NTSB chief added. It is not clear if there is a link between the issues that led to those warnings, and the issue that caused the blowout on 5 January. ""An additional maintenance look"" was requested but ""not completed"" before the incident, Ms Homendy said. The plane was brand new having been delivered to Alaska Airlines in October - at which time it was judged by the FAA to be airworthy. Ms Homendy also used the conference to set out new details of the ""very chaotic"" and ""terrifying"" situation on board Alaska Airlines flight 1282. The force of the blowout caused the door of the cockpit to open and a laminated checklist and the first officer's headset both flew out into the cabin, she said. She added that no information from the cockpit voice recorder was available, as the recording had been automatically wiped after a two-hour cut-off was reached. The NTSB wanted this window to be increased to 25 hours, she added. Ms Homendy later announced that the part of the fuselage that detached had been found, after a teacher named Bob located the missing section in his backyard. ""I'm excited to announce that we've found the door plug,"" she told reporters. ""Thank you, Bob."" The plug is a piece of fuselage weighing 27kg (60lb), with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. Authorities had been searching for it in Portland, the departure city. Ms Homedy said it was the ""key missing component"" to work out why the blowout happened. Two mobile phones believed to have fallen from the aircraft are also reported to have been found. An Oregon man shared an image of an iPhone which he said he had discovered, working as normal, in a grass verge beside a road. The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (£55) checked baggage charge for the flight. Flight 1282 reached 16,000ft (4.8km) when it began its emergency descent on Friday evening, according to flight tracking data. Images shared online - and later by investigators - showed a wide hole in the side of the craft, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling. One passenger, Diego Murillo, said the gap left by the missing component was ""as wide as a refrigerator"". Passengers were quoted by The Oregonian newspaper as saying that a young boy seated near the affected area had his shirt ripped off by the force of the decompression. Alaska Airlines said in its most recent statement: ""While we await the airworthiness directive (AD) inspection criteria from the FAA and Boeing, our maintenance teams are prepared and ready to perform the required inspections of the mid exit door plugs on our 737-9 Max fleet. ""The 737-9 Max grounding has significantly impacted our operation. We have cancelled 170 Sunday flights and 60 cancellations for Monday, with more expected."" Boeing said in a statement: ""Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers."" The company's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues. In late 2018 and early 2019, two of its aircraft were lost in near identical incidents, off the coast of Indonesia and outside the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. A total of 346 people were killed. Both crashes were caused by flawed flight control software, which ultimately forced the planes into catastrophic dives, despite the best efforts of the pilots. After Friday's incident in the US, the European Union's regulator followed the example of its US counterpart. But it expected disruption to be minimal as it believed no European airlines used Max 9s with the configuration covered by the FAA order. Icelandair said it was not affected. The real-time flight-tracking website Flightradar24 confirmed that a number of the airline's Max 9s were in the skies on Monday morning. The bulk of the affected planes are operated by US operators - 79 of them by United Airlines and 65 by Alaska - which has meant disruption for thousands of passengers.","['Aviation accidents and incidents', 'United States', 'Aviation safety', 'Oregon', 'Boeing']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BE7/production/_132255279_gdwafwjaqaedplt-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/A04B/production/_132253014_portland_flight_reroute_2x640-nc.png']","['James FitzGerald', 'Kathryn Armstrong']",World,US & Canada

Mr Biden, 81, was speaking at a black church in South Carolina, where a white supremacist gunned down nine black parishioners in a hate crime in 2015. ""The truth is under assault,"" he told the packed hall. ""This is a time of choosing. So let's choose America."" The speech was briefly derailed by hecklers demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. ""If you care about lives lost, you should care about Palestine,"" a woman shouted before a small group of demonstrators broke into chants of ""ceasefire now!"" inside the building. But the crowd drowned them out with chants of ""four more years!"" as they were escorted away by security, with one elderly woman standing up to proclaim the protesters ""don't understand"" that the president is a ""good man"". Four years ago, black Democrats in South Carolina helped turn Mr Biden's fortunes around in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. After coming in fourth and fifth respectively in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the former vice-president won the southern state and went on to win the party's nomination before beating Donald Trump in the general election. Mr Biden's return to South Carolina is a bet on the black vote, a crucial pillar of Democratic support. Ninety-two percent of black voters backed Mr Biden over Mr Trump for the White House in the last election. But recent polling shows that support may be faltering, with as many as 22% of black voters now leaning towards the Republican ex-president. There was no sign of that on Monday at the Mother Emanuel AME Church, where several hundred people packed into the warm, wood-panelled building to hear from Mr Biden. A mix of black and white supporters wearing Biden-Harris 2024 pins, the crowd welcomed the president with a standing ovation and lavished him with supportive chants. ""We love you Joe,"" screamed a handful of old ladies seated in the front pews, while an elderly man shouted ""Go Joe!"" from the upper deck. Introducing Mr Biden to the dais was Representative Jim Clyburn, the South Carolina politician whose influential endorsement propelled Mr Biden to victory in the state's primary in 2020. The congressman told CNN on Sunday that he was ""very concerned"" about the president's standing with black voters. Rattling off his achievements over the past three years, Mr Clyburn blamed the media for failing to report on Mr Biden's successes but said he had kept many of his promises. ""You know Joe, but more importantly, Joe knows us,"" he declared, referring to Mr Biden as ""the man best qualified, the man totally committed to making every American part of the American Dream"". When the president took the stage, he reminded the audience of how white supremacy had fuelled the hate crime inside the church eight years ago. ""The word of God was pierced by bullets of hate and rage"" but the Charleston community's ""act of grace"" in forgiving the gunman had ""brought down the Confederate flag"" in South Carolina, he said. Pivoting to his Republican opponents, he criticised those who seek to spread lies. ""Slavery was the cause of the Civil War,"" he said, in a rebuke of recent remarks by Nikki Haley, the state's former Republican governor who is now running for president. But Mr Biden reserved most of his ire for Mr Trump, who he accused of spreading false claims about the 2020 election, fomenting political violence and lacking ""respect for the 81 million people who voted the other way"". ""We must reject political violence in America. Always. It's never appropriate,"" Mr Biden said. ""Losers are taught to concede when they lose, and he's a loser."" Reminding voters in the room that he had chosen the first black vice-president and the first black female Supreme Court justice, Mr Biden added: ""Instead of erasing history, we're making history."" The campaign has bristled at the idea that it is losing support among black Americans. After the speech, senior campaign officials vowed to ""continue to communicate"" its 2024 message with a focus on showing the black community how it has followed through on its promises. ""Polls don't vote. Voters vote,"" principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told reporters after the speech. ""There's a long time before voters start to vote. And before that time, we have one job: to make voters understand that their choice is between President Biden offering more freedoms, not less, and what the Republican Party is trying to do."" He added: ""I want to be very clear - no president has done more for the black community than what Joe Biden has done."" Amid low approval ratings and signs of faltering support, Mr Biden has stepped up his engagement on the campaign trail. On Friday, he marked the third anniversary of the riot at the US Capitol with a speech in Pennsylvania, where he condemned Mr Trump in harsh terms and framed the November election as an ""existential choice"" for the country.

Mr Biden was subpoenaed to testify privately about his business dealings for the impeachment case against his father, President Joe Biden. He refused, and Republicans called his actions ""contemptuous"" and unlawful in a report published on Monday. Democrats say the case is a meritless partisan attack against the president. Rep James Comer, who chairs the Oversight Committee, released the report on Monday. It recommends that Hunter Biden face charges, which he will if a resolution is passed by Comer's committee and then the entire House. ""We planned to question Hunter Biden,"" Mr Comer said in a statement, ""but he blatantly defied two lawful subpoenas, choosing to read a prepared statement outside of the Capitol instead of appearing for testimony as required."" Mr Biden's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In November, Mr Biden told House Republicans that he was willing to testify to the Oversight Committee, but only if it was a public hearing. His counsel, Abbe Lowell, said it would ""let the light shine"" on the proceedings. Republicans refused, and instead Mr Biden made a rare in-person statement outside the Capitol on the day he was to appear before Congress. He slammed Republicans, alleging they had ""distorted the facts"" and called for a public hearing. He added that he would not testify privately, and said there was ""no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business, because it did not happen"". ""Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics, expose their baseless inquiry or hear what I have to say,"" the president's son added. ""What are they afraid of? I'm here. I'm ready."" The Oversight Committee, which Mr Comer chairs, is planning to consider the resolution on Wednesday morning. Its passage through that body is the first step toward it being considered by the wider House. At the same time, the Judiciary Committee - chaired by Rep Jim Jordan of Ohio - will review the report released on Monday that lays out the Republicans' case against Hunter Biden. The process will give opposition Democrats an opportunity to read the report and offer notes. But the entire House would have to vote to refer Hunter Biden to the Justice Department for contempt of Congress charges. Because of the razor thin majority Republicans have in the House, all of its members would likely have to vote to pass it. Republicans have led a months-long investigation into the president that has yet to uncover any concrete evidence of misconduct. The inquiry has centred in part around Hunter Biden, who also faces federal tax and gun charges. He has pleaded not guilty. The impeachment probe has focused on his work for companies overseas, including in Ukraine and China. House Republicans have also alleged that the US Justice Department ""impeded, delayed, and obstructed"" an ongoing multi-year criminal probe into the president's son. Democrats and even some Republicans have criticised the impeachment investigation, which the White House has called a ""political stunt"" designed to hurt the president's re-election bid.","['Hunter Biden', 'United States', 'Joe Biden', 'US Congress']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/182E5/production/_132254099_microsoftteams-image-4.png'],['Phil McCausland'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67908840,Host Jo Koy's jokes fall flat and six other Golden Globes moments,"The Golden Globe Awards on Sunday had everything - jokes which fell flat, public displays of affection, and plenty of Taylor Swift.",2024-01-08,"The Golden Globe Awards on Sunday had everything - jokes which fell flat, public displays of affection, and plenty of Taylor Swift. Oppenheimer, Poor Things and The Holdovers were among the big film winners, while Succession, Beef and The Bear scored some of the big prizes in the TV categories. The Globes lived up to its boozy reputation with the red carpet even having its own bar along the way, the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent Emma Vardy said. As the stars passed underneath the signature golden chandelier and greeted each other, the glamorous night had a feel-good factor about it, a big contrast from the animosity felt over the actors and writers strikes a few months ago. As the last champagne glasses are drained and the red carpet is rolled up, here are seven highlights from the ceremony: Comic Jo Koy, a first-time presenter at the Globes, struggled to get his opening monologue off the ground. As BuzzFeed's David Mack joked, Koy's monologue was, ""in a tribute to Oppenheimer, a bomb"". Koy himself seemed to acknowledge some of his jokes weren't catching fire - at one point, he told the audience: ""I got this gig 10 days ago, you want a perfect monologue?!"" Here's a selection of his one-liners: Koy's jokes throughout the night provoked a number of different reactions in the room. Selena Gomez was spotted with her head in her hands as the comedian made jokes about the Barbie movie. Viewers also took to social media to comment on the opening monologue. Erik Anderson of Awards Watch wrote: ""I thought the writers strike was over."" In 2023, Hollywood's writers went on strike for several months, picketing outside the studios of major studios including Disney, Netflix and Paramount, over pay and work conditions in the streaming age. When presenting the award for best screenplay, Daniel Kaluuya, Hailee Steinfeld and Shameik Moore defended the importance of screenwriters and poked fun at studio executives. Steinfeld started by saying ""This year we were all reminded of the critical importance of writer to the creative process."" Kaluuya continued: ""To demonstrate the importance of writers and writing, we asked that this segment be written not by writers, but by studio executives."" The trio then performed an incomprehensible skit, suggesting that studio executives could never do the work of the professional writers. Taylor Swift looked less than impressed when host and comedian Jo Koy took the opportunity to make a joke about the singer's relationship with American Footballer Travis Kelce. ""We came on after football double header,"" Koy said, noting the Globes had immediately followed a match. ""Do you know the big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? On the Golden Globes we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift."" As the camera panned to Taylor, she took a long, long sip from her glass and showed little reaction. Since the start of their relationship, Swift has frequently been seen cheering for boyfriend Kelce at Kansas City Chiefs games. (The Globes continue to cut to Swift for the rest of the night.) Well known for her athletic ability, mixed martial arts and stunt work, Michelle Yeoh is one actress you don't want to cross. Last year, Yeoh took home the Golden Globe for best musical or comedy actress for her performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once. As the pianist began playing to signal it was time to wrap it up, she joked ""Shut up, please. I can beat you up, and that's serious!"" Presenting the award this year, Yeoh referred back to last year, commenting that she was ""very chill"". ""I know last year I threatened to beat up the piano player if they tried to play me off my acceptance speech,"" she recalled. ""While I won't do anything if you cut me off this year, I will kick your ass if you cut off whoever is about to win this award right now."" But plenty of winners were told to wrap up this year too. Emma Stone seemed to have only just started her speech before she said: ""Oh my god, there's only like 18 seconds left."" To be fair to the Globes - the tight timings meant they finished only a few minutes late this year - Hollywood awards ceremonies often run much longer. More from the Golden Globes: Ayo Edebiri, who plays Sydney in The Bear, won the Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy TV series. In an unprepared speech, she recognised not just her agent and manager, but ""all of my agents and managers assistants"". ""To the people who answer my emails - Y'all are real ones. Thank you for answering my crazy crazy emails!"" she said. Earlier this week, Edebiri's co-star Jeremy Allen White, another winner at the Globes, launched his Calvin Klein campaign, causing a stir amongst fans online. Speaking to press after accepting his award for best actor in a musical or comedy TV series, he said: ""It's been a weird couple of days"". In true Jennifer Lawrence fashion, the actress provided the 2024 Golden Globes with one of its funniest and most unforgettable gags of the evening. Lawrence was nominated in the best actress in a motion picture comedy or musical category for her performance in the R-rated comedy No Hard Feelings. As the award was being announced, the Oscar winner mouthed ""If I don't win, I'm leaving!"" directly to the camera. Sure enough, she ended up losing to Poor Things star Emma Stone, but in the event, no one in the room looked happier than Lawrence. Stone and Lawrence are close friends, and Lawrence stood up and cheered when Stone's name was announced as the winner. Timothee Chalamet was nominated in the best actor - musical or comedy category for his performance as the title character in Wonka. He attended the ceremony with girlfriend Kylie Jenner. The pair have been dating for a few months, and although they didn't walk the red carpet together, they sat together inside. The Wonka star posed on the Golden Globes red carpet on his own, but once inside both he and Jenner appeared more interested in each other than the awards ceremony itself. Chalamet eventually went on to lose to Paul Giamatti's performance in the Christmas comedy drama The Holdovers, but he might not know that yet. It appears 2024 is just getting started for the celebrity couple.",['Golden Globes'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5D9A/production/_132226932_crgettyimages-1908169036.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/ABBA/production/_132226934_crgettyimages-1908169512-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16F0A/production/_132226939_21be5794af2a84e472f225ad29fd7638e345f736.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F9DA/production/_132226936_crgettyimages-1908169932.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/146CE/production/_132226638_ce726067a68990bad29a41ec084f5389e1477f41.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6D3A/production/_132226972_e4595f9af1081d4344baf83ce8f8551642c9aa35.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/147FA/production/_132226938_gettyimages-1908165827-1.jpg']",['Guy Lambert'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67911193,'Thank you Bob': Search for plane's blown-out panel ended by teacher,"Two phones and a ""door plug"": these are some of the items found in Oregon days after Alaska Airlines flight 1282 lost part of its fuselage at 16,000 feet.",2024-01-08,"Two phones and a ""door plug"": these are some of the items found in Oregon days after Alaska Airlines flight 1282 lost part of its fuselage at 16,000 feet. The Boeing 737 Max 9 made a safe emergency landing on 5 January after an outer section of the plane blew off minutes into the flight from Portland. None of the 177 people on board were seriously injured in the incident. But the search continues for other lost belongings and parts, thought to include a cushion from the seat immediately next to the blown-out section of fuselage - which was thankfully unoccupied. One of the key missing items, the door plug, was found by a local school teacher named Bob, according to US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chair Jennifer Homendy. The discovery came after officials from the NTSB asked the public for help finding the door plug - a 27kg (60lb) piece of fuselage with a window, that can be used as an emergency exit in certain configurations. They believed the door could have landed around Barnes Road, near Oregon-217 and the Cedar Hills neighbourhood, based on radar data. During a news conference, Ms Homendy said Bob sent in a picture of the missing piece, which ended up in his backyard in Portland. ""I can just see the outside of the door plug from the pictures, the white portions,"" Ms Homendy said. ""We can't see anything else but we're going to go pick that up and make sure that we begin analysing it."" ""Thank you Bob,"" she added. The NTSB has since recovered the door plug from the teacher to aid in its ongoing investigation into the incident. Taking a walk near Barnes Road, another man claimed he found a ""perfectly intact"" iPhone believed to belong to a passenger. Sharing photos of his discovery on X, formerly Twitter, game designer Sean Bates said the NTSB told him it was the second phone to be found. Mr Bates' photos show the stretch of Barnes Road where he said he found the phone, along with a picture of it - no cracks to be seen, but with a broken-off piece of what used to be a white phone charger still attached to it. He joked that it was possible that the phone's airplane mode feature being turned on helped it survive the 16,000ft (4,876m) drop. ""It was still pretty clean, no scratches on it, sitting under a bush and it didn't have a screen lock on it,"" Mr Bates said in a TikTok video. ""I opened it up and it was on airplane mode with a travel confirmation... so I had to go call the NTSB."" The device appeared to display an email receipt for a $70 (£55) checked baggage charge for the flight. Several passengers have described their fear during the incident, which happened shortly after take-off en route to Ontario, California. Evan Smith, one of the 171 passengers on board, said: ""There was a really loud bang towards the left rear of the plane and a woosh noise - and all the air masks dropped. ""They said there was a kid in that row who had his shirt sucked off him and out of the plane and his mother was holding onto him to make sure he didn't go with it."" Jessica Montoia, another passenger, described the flight as a ""trip from hell"", adding that a phone was taken out of a man's hand by the wind. It is unclear whether that phone is the same Mr Bates found on his walk. Around 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft remain grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as safety checks continue. Meanwhile, investigators have said the specific Alaska plane involved in Friday's incident experienced pressurisation warnings in the days before.","['Aviation accidents and incidents', 'United States', 'Aviation safety', 'Oregon', 'Boeing']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8144/production/_132229033_53449315887_5d6f542a92_k.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1157B/production/_132253017_portland_flight_reroute_2x640-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BE7/production/_132255279_gdwafwjaqaedplt-1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8C3E/production/_132220953_81602d9cb3df876d092d23574b77fbd4e42a80c2.jpg']",['Sofia Ferreira'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67908727,"Margot Robbie, Taylor Swift and more on Golden Globes red carpet",The 2024 awards season kicked off in style at the Golden Globes - the first major red carpet event of the year.,2024-01-08,"The 2024 awards season kicked off in style at the Golden Globes - the first major red carpet event of the year. A four-month strike kept actors away from the red carpet for much of the second half of 2023, but Hollywood stars made up for lost time and dressed to impress. Compared to the Oscars, the Golden Globes are usually a more relaxed affair, often resulting in a more playful mood on the red carpet. Margot Robbie - star of one of the night's biggest films, Barbie - was certainly having fun with her outfit. Robbie wore a series of pink looks for last year's promotional tour but it seemed she saved the best for last, wearing a custom-made replica 1977 Superstar Barbie outfit by Armani consisting of a hot pink sequinned dress accessorised with a tulle stole. Taylor Swift arrived in colourful sequins, too - for her, a striking green gown. The singer, nominated for best cinematic and box office achievement for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, walked the red carpet without her NFL boyfriend Travis Kelce, who was busy with a game a few miles away at LA's SoFi stadium. Red was the colour of choice for many celebrities. Julianne Moore wore a structured Bottega dress complete with deep pockets - which she said she wished contained snacks to get her through the three-hour show. Florence Pugh wore a sheer red Valentino gown covered in delicate roses. Inside she was seen embracing another lady in red, singer Selena Gomez, who wore asymmetric silk Armani Privé. Ayo Edebiri, star of The Bear, looked stunning in strapless red Prada and later was named best actress in a musical or comedy series. It wasn't just the women wearing crimson. Saltburn star Barry Keoghan looked resplendent in red custom Louis Vuitton. Keoghan is one of several male actors shaking things up on the red carpet. Gone are the days when the men all turn up in matching black tuxedos. Andrew Scott, up for a best actor award for his role in All of Us Strangers, dressed top-to-toe in white. Timothée Chalamet's sequinned Celine Homme jacket was relatively tame compared to some of his previous get-ups. The Bear's Jeremy Allen White - who recently became the new face (and body) of Calvin Klein underwear - kept it simple with a black suit, though his sheer shirt hinted at why he landed the modelling gig. The Last of Us's Pedro Pascal appeared to be sporting an injury, but his arm sling was dressed fabulously in Bottega Veneta. For many of the women, black proved to be the go-to option. British actress Rosamund Pike, nominated for her role as an aristocratic matriarch in Saltburn, accessorised her black lace dress with a dramatic matching headpiece - not entirely a fashion choice. She says the ""protective veil"" is because she hurt her face in a skiing accident over Christmas. Jennifer Aniston also wore black - custom Dolce & Gabbana - but much more exciting than her outfit was that she appeared to have brought back the famous ""Rachel"" haircut from Friends. Jennifer Lawrence kept it simple in a black Dior dress, Angela Bassett an off-the-shoulder velvet number and Greta Gerwig in black high-necked satin. More colourful was Oprah Winfrey in a purple Louis Vuitton dress - a nod to The Color Purple, which she co-produced. Helen Mirren chose a lavender Dolce & Gabbana dress with a matching opera coat. Pop star Dua Lipa, attending both as a presenter and a nominee for best original song, wore a custom black velvet Schiaparelli dress featuring a series of gold ""bones"" on the bodice and a voluminous bustle skirt. She wasn't the only music star to stand out on the red carpet. Billie Eilish wore a mostly thrifted and DIY outfit consisting of an oversized jacket, a skirt that resembled shorts, and a pair of geek-chic glasses. Lily Gladstone, who gave a stand-out performance in Killers of the Flower Moon, proved she's equally commanding on the red carpet. She wore a white Valentino gown with a dramatic black shawl, accessorised with earrings designed by a member of the Blackfeet Tribe. The actress has frequently used her promotional appearances to showcase indigenous craftspeople. Gillian Anderson, meanwhile, wore a dress by designer Gabriela Hearst. She said it was embroidered with female anatomy, in a protest against restrictions on women's rights, Deadline reported. But if some used the red carpet to make a political statement, others were just happy to take the chance to shine - quite literally. Elizabeth Debicki, who won for her portrayal of Princess Diana in The Crown, wore a shimmering metallic gown. And Barbie's Issa Rae was a real life golden girl in a dazzling Pamela Roland gown. It was a suitably sparkling start to the 2024 awards season - proving the red carpet is well and truly back in business.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67915771,Alaskan Airlines flight 1282: Key questions behind door plug blowout,"Alaska Airlines flight 1282 was on a routine flight from Portland in Oregon to Ontario in California, when an unused cabin door broke away a few minutes after take off.",2024-01-08,"Alaska Airlines flight 1282 was on a routine flight from Portland in Oregon to Ontario in California, when an unused cabin door broke away a few minutes after take off. The section that fell from the sky was a 27kg (60lb) part of the shell. Known as a door plug, this was used to fill an emergency exit that was built into the plane but not needed by Alaska Airlines. The cabin abruptly depressurised, creating a rush of air that ripped off the flight crews headsets and sent phones and other items flying out of the plane. The aircraft was delivered to Alaska Airlines on 31 October 2023, and would only have completed around 100 flights a month. Normal wear and tear or maintenance failures are unlikely to have been factors affecting such a young aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSF), which is investigating the accident, has already said it does not suspect a design flaw. In fact, this type of door has been used on older 737s since 2006, and has not suffered any serious issues. That means the focus is likely to be on whether the door itself could have been faulty, and whether it was bolted in place correctly. The door was produced by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which has previously faced criticism for serious quality control failures. But Boeing itself has been accused in the past of chaotic conditions in its factories and corners being cut on the production line. Boeing insists that is not the case today, and emphasises that safety is its first priority. The discovery of the missing door will provide vital clues for investigators about what went wrong and why. The 737 Max 9 has been ordered by many different airlines. The way they use those planes will not always be the same, and there are different options available for seating. The number of emergency exits required depends on the number of seats. With a less crowded cabin, it can operate with four main doors, and another four smaller exits over the wings. But if configured with the maximum number of seats, a further two exits are required - midway between the wings and the tail of the aircraft. In practice, Boeing builds all its Max 9 airframes with these extra doors. If they are not required, a non-operational door, or ""plug"" is fitted, concealed behind the interior trim. The light that came on in the cockpit is known as an ""auto pressurisation fail"" light. It comes on when the pressure in the cabin, which is usually regulated automatically, changes at an unusually fast rate. The crew can respond by adjusting the cabin pressure manually, or if concerned by descending to a lower altitude. However, such warnings can also appear due to minor faults. In the case of the Alaska Airlines plane, the light had come on during several flights over a short period. The issue had clearly been reported to maintenance staff, whose response would have been dictated by the aircraft's maintenance manual. This is a document written by Boeing, but signed off by regulators. Restrictions were placed on where the plane could fly, and according to the NTSB additional investigations had been ordered, but had yet to be carried out when the failure occurred. In the immediate aftermath of Friday's accident (this is the term used by the NTSB), Alaska Airlines grounded its entire fleet of 65 737 Max 9 aircraft. However, on Saturday 18 planes were briefly allowed back into service. Those planes had recently undergone major overhauls, including inspections of door plugs. No problems had been found and the company believed they were safe. But when the Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive banning affected aircraft from flying until they had undergone specific checks, it had no option but to ground all 18 planes once again. The NTSB is carrying out a full investigation. This will involve, for example, examining the plane itself, the lost door (which has now been found in a back garden in Oregon), the contents of the flight data recorder and maintenance records, as well as interviewing flight crew, maintenance staff and employees of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems. The purpose of the investigation is to find out what went wrong and why. It is not meant to apportion blame. However, there is clear jeopardy here for Boeing. The 737 Max is its bestselling aircraft, a favourite among airlines because of its low running costs and fuel efficiency. But its safety record has already been badly tarnished as a result of two accidents that occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, in which 346 people were killed. The aerospace giant insists it is a different company today. In a message to staff, chief executive Dave Calhoun said ""when serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don't happen again.""","['Aviation accidents and incidents', 'Aviation safety', 'Boeing']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/71CF/production/_132253192_alaska_door_diagram_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/23AF/production/_132253190_alaska_airlines_blow_out_v2_2x_640-nc-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/12011/production/_132254737_alaska_airlines_altitude_infographic_640-2x-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/98DF/production/_132253193_portland_flight_reroute_2x640-nc.png']",['Theo Leggett'],World,US & Canada

A cabin panel tore off a 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines, forcing an emergency landing and prompting safety officials to ground the same-make jets installed with the affected door plug. The US plane-maker's shares ended Monday trading down 8%, while shares in supplier Spirit Aerosystems fell 11%. The incident added to quality questions facing the firms. ""It's more about the whole perception of Boeing as an operator and its long-term safety record,"" John Grant, chief analyst at the aviation analytics firm OAG, told the BBC's World Business Report programme. ""You have lots of individual incidents that are adding up to a very long catalogue of problems for Boeing and indeed for their airline customers who need to use these aircraft."" Boeing has been trying to emerge from the shadow of two high-profile crashes involving a different 737 model, the Max 8, in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people. Boeing started developing the 737 Max in 2011 as a more fuel-efficient option for short and medium-length flights. It has been popular with airlines but dogged by questions about quality arising from electrical faults, loose bolts and other issues, some of which have also involved Spirit AeroSystems. Before the emergency near the Portland, Oregon airport, the firms' history had already drawn the attention of safety campaigners. After the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded 171 of the fleet of more than 200 737 Max 9 planes for inspection, leading hundreds of flights on Alaska, United and other airlines to be cancelled. United on Monday said preliminary inspections had uncovered instances of installation issues related to the door plug - ""for example bolts that needed tightening"". The news sent shares lower in afternoon trading. Analyst Mr Grant said the industry generally had been having supply chain issues and struggling to deliver planes on time, leading to pressure to move more quickly. ""You just sense that perhaps something has slipped in Boeing and it's been like that for a couple of years and they haven't got to grips with it,"" he said. ""Boeing are really going to come back under the microscope again."" Boeing said earlier Monday that the assembly under review was not found on other Max jets and that it was committed to safety and working with regulators. Spirit AeroSystems, which made and installed the part, had named a new chief executive in October. It said in a statement on Monday that its ""primary focus"" was ""the quality and product integrity of the aircraft structures we deliver"". ""We are grateful the Alaska Airlines crew performed the appropriate procedures to land the airplane with all passengers and crew safe,"" Spirit said in its statement. ""Spirit is a committed partner with Boeing on the 737 program, and we continue to work together with them on this matter."" The plane involved in Friday's emergency had been cleared to fly and put into service a few months ago. Alaska Airlines staff had flagged it for pressurisation issues and the airline had restricted it from long flights over water. Since the 2018 and 2019 accidents, arch-rival Airbus has taken the crown of world's top plane-seller, expanding its market share against Boeing. Shares in the French firm rose more than 3% in trade on Monday.","['United States Capitol', 'Boeing']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2355/production/_132254090_gettyimages-1910141194.jpg'],['Natalie Sherman'],World,US & Canada

It is a major oil exporter, but rural areas and shanty towns suffer neglect. Pre-Columbian Mexico was one of world's cradles of civilization, and home to civilizations including the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, Purepecha and Aztecs. In past decades, Mexico has been contending with high crime rates, official corruption, narcotrafficking and a stagnant economy. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the continuing organised crime killings and drugs-related gang violence since 2006, which saw the army being deployed to crackdown on drugs cartels. President Andres Manuel López Obrador Left-wing candidate Andres Manuel López Obrador won an overwhelming victory in the 2018 presidential election. His priorities are to tackle corruption and reverse decades of free-market economic policy - which he blames for social inequality, endemic violence, and the desire of so many young people to leave the country is search of a better life. Mr López Obrador, popularly known by his initials Amlo, is a former mayor of Mexico City, and stood for the presidency on two earlier occasions. Reporters Without Borders describes Mexico as ""one of the hemisphere's most dangerous countries"" for the media. Drug cartels and corrupt officials are implicated in most of the crimes of violence against journalists, which almost always go unpunished. Two big players, Televisa and TV Azteca, dominate the TV sector. Mexico is one of Latin America's biggest internet markets. Some key dates in Mexico's history: 1500BC - Beginning of Olmec culture - the first major Mesoamerican civilization. 600BC - Olmecs replaced by regional cultures such as Maya, Zapotec, Totonac, and Teotihuacán civilizations. 250-AD - Mayan civilization, based around Yucatan, grows to become one of the most dominant groups. Classical Mayan civilization reaches its peak c. 600AD in alliance with the Teotihuacán. 600-1000 - Toltecs migrate from north of Teotihuacán and establish their empire in the central valley of Mexico by 10th Century. Spread of militarism in Mesoamerican societies. 1200 - Toltecs defeated by Chichimecha alliance. 14th Century - The Chichimecha - or Aztecs - settle in Mexico's central valley, and found Tenochtitlán near Lake Texcoco. 1420s - Aztecs emerge as the dominant force in central Mexico. 1517 - Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, is the first European to visit Mexican territory. Arriving with about 100 men he withdraws after clashes with locals. 1519 - Spanish army under Hernán Cortés lands at Veracruz, marking the start of Spain's conquest of Mexico. 1521 - Cortés and his local allies finally defeat Aztec forces and capture Tenochtitlán.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67908646,US budget: Spending deal reached as shutdown deadline looms,US Congress leaders have reached a deal over the total amount of spending for the rest of 2024 as they seek to avoid a partial government shutdown.,2024-01-08,"US Congress leaders have reached a deal over the total amount of spending for the rest of 2024 as they seek to avoid a partial government shutdown. The $1.6tn (£1.2tn) figure includes $886bn for defence and more than $704bn for non-defence spending, according to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. However, there appears to be some discrepancy over the numbers. The deal now needs approval from the House of Representatives and Senate. They have less than two weeks to finalise funding and stop the suspension of some federal services. According to a statement from Democrats Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer - House Minority Leader and Senate Majority Leader respectively - the non-defence spending amount agreed is $772bn. Mr Johnson, announcing the deal had been reached in a letter to colleagues, accepted that the amount of funding ""will not satisfy everyone, and they do not cut as much spending as many of us would like"". The proposed plan accelerates an already agreed upon $20bn (£15.7bn) cut to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which would happen this year rather than over the next two years. It would also take back $6.1bn (£4.79bn) in unused Covid funds. Republicans have been seeking to freeze overall government spending by cutting some budgets. Sunday's deal includes greater protection from cuts to benefits and health - a provision demanded by Democrats. The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative Republican group within Congress, called the deal a ""total failure"". ""Sad to say but the spending epidemic in Washington continues with both parties being culpable,"" said Andy Biggs, the group's former chairman. In a statement, Mr Jeffries and Mr Schumer said the agreement ""clears the way for Congress to act over the next few weeks in order to maintain important funding priorities for the American people and avoid a government shutdown"". President Biden, meanwhile, said it ""moves us one step closer to preventing a needless government shutdown and protecting important national priorities"". Lawmakers are due to resume negotiations in Washington on Monday following the holiday break and have until 19 January to sort out funding for programmes including transport, housing and energy. A second load of annual funding, for sectors including defence, expires on 2 February. The agreement on an overall amount of spending comes after the government in October secured a short-term deal to avoid a federal shutdown temporarily, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden minutes before the deadline. Shutdowns normally happen when both chambers of Congress are unable to agree on the roughly 30% of federal spending they must approve before the start of each fiscal year on 1 October. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House and Democrats holding the Senate by a single seat, any funding measure needs buy-in from both parties. Repeated efforts to pass spending bills in the House in recent months have been thwarted in recent weeks by rebel right-wing Republicans. Meanwhile, an agreement has still not been reached on a separate bill which includes a further $50bn of military aid to Ukraine, as Congress continues to argue over migration policy at America's southern border. October's short-term deal to prevent a shutdown excluded new aid for Kyiv in a blow for Democrats, for whom this was a key demand. Some Republicans argue that any further funding would be detrimental to America's interests. Congress has so far approved more than $100bn (£78bn) in military, humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine since Russia began its full-scale invasion last year. Negotiations are also continuing about providing further security aid to Israel as it seeks to eliminate Hamas following the 7 October attacks.","['United States', 'US Congress']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/AC1E/production/_132226044_gettyimages-1850429561.jpg'],['Kathryn Armstrong'],World,US & Canada
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67410372,The last of the Moon men: the stories of the surviving Apollo astronauts,They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.,2024-01-08,"They were the pioneers of space exploration - the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Now, in 2024, the race to put people back on the lunar surface is set to heat up once again. On 8 January, United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur - one of the private competitors to Elon Musk's SpaceX -  launched on its maiden Moon mission, carrying Astrobotic's Peregrine 1. Peregrine aims to be the first US craft to make a soft lunar landing since the Apollo programme when it reaches the Moon in February. And, in November, Nasa hopes to launch Artemis 2, its first crewed lunar expedition in more than 50 years. It hopes the new programme will lead to astronauts living on the Moon this decade. China is also hoping to have people on the lunar surface by 2030. These planned launches highlight the sad fact that the number of remaining Apollo astronauts is dwindling. The programme's Ken Mattingly and Frank Borman died within a few days of each other late last year. Now only eight people who have voyaged beyond the Earth's orbit remain. Who are they, and what are their stories? On 21 July 1969, former fighter pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin left his lunar landing craft and became the second person to step on the surface of the Moon. Almost 20 minutes beforehand, his commander, Neil Armstrong, had been the first. Aldrin's first words were: ""Beautiful view"". ""Isn't that something?"" asked Armstrong.""Magnificent sight out here."" ""Magnificent desolation,"" replied Aldrin. The fact that he was second never sat comfortably with him. His crewmate Michael Collins said Aldrin ""resented not being first on the Moon more than he appreciated being second"". But Aldrin was still proud of his achievement: many years later, when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, the 72-year-old Aldrin punched him on the jaw. And following Neil Armstrong's death in 2012, Aldrin said: ""I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew."" Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars. ""I don't think we should just go there and come back - we did that with Apollo,"" he says. And his name has become known to new generations as the inspiration for Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series of films. In January 2023, at the age of 93, he married for a fourth time. In December 1968, Bill Anders flew on Apollo 8, the first mission in which humans travelled beyond low Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for the fourth pass across its face, the crew witnessed an ""Earthrise"" for the first time in human history, Anders capturing the moment on film. The image is widely credited with motivating the global environmental movement and leading to the creation of Earth Day, an annual event to promote activism and awareness of caring for the planet. Speaking of the moment, Anders said: ""We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing that we discovered was the Earth."" Following his retirement from the space programme in 1969, Anders largely worked in the aerospace industry for several decades. He also served as US Ambassador to Norway for a year in the 1970s. There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon - Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface. In a later BBC interview, he spoke of a ""spectacular terrain"". ""The beauty of it… the sharp contrast between the blackness of space and the horizon of the Moon… I'll never forget it. It was so dramatic."" But he had already played another significant role in Nasa's exploration of the Moon. After Apollo 11 touched down in 1969, it was Duke - in mission control as the Capsule Communicator, or Capcom - who was waiting nervously on the other end of the line when Neil Armstrong said: ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" In his distinctive southern drawl, Duke replied: ""Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground, you've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we're breathing again."" ""I really meant it, I was holding my breath the last minute or so,"" he later told the BBC. In 2022, Duke told the BBC he was excited about Nasa's Artemis mission - but warned that it wouldn't be easy for the new generation of astronauts. ""They've picked near the South Pole for the landing, because if there's any ice on the Moon, it would be down in that region. So that's gonna be difficult - because it's really rough down there. But we'll pull it off."" Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years. Fred Haise was part of the crew of Apollo 13 that narrowly avoided disaster in 1970 after an on-board explosion caused the mission to be aborted when the craft was more than 200,000 miles (321,000km) from Earth. The whole world watched nervously as Nasa attempted to return the damaged spacecraft and its crew safely. Once back, Haise and his crewmates James Lovell and Jack Swigert became celebrities, to their apparent surprise. ""I feel like maybe I missed something while I was up there,"" he told talk show host Johnny Carson when the crew appeared on The Tonight Show. Haise never made it to the Moon. Although scheduled to be commander of Apollo 19, that mission was cancelled because of budget cuts, as were all other flights after Apollo 17. He later served as a test pilot on the prototype space shuttle, Enterprise. Like many of his fellow Apollo alumni, after leaving Nasa, Haise continued to work in the aerospace industry until his retirement. Lovell, Borman and Anders made history when they undertook the first lunar mission on Apollo 8, testing the Command/Service Module and its life support systems in preparation for the later Apollo 11 landing. Their craft actually made 10 orbits of the Moon before returning home. Lovell was later supposed be the fifth human to walk on the lunar surface as commander of Apollo 13 - but of course, that never happened. Instead the story of his brush with death was immortalised in the film Apollo 13, in which he was played by Tom Hanks. Following his retirement from Nasa in 1973, Lovell worked in the telecoms industry. Marilyn, his wife of more than 60 years, who became a focus for the media during the infamous incident, died in August 2023. Jim Lovell is one of only three men to have travelled to the Moon twice, and following Frank Borman's death in November 2023, he became the oldest living astronaut. Unlike most other astronauts of the time, Schmitt had not served as a pilot in the US forces. A geologist and academic, he initially instructed Nasa astronauts on what to look for during their geological lunar field trips before becoming a scientist-astronaut himself in 1965. Schmitt was part of the last crewed mission to the Moon, Apollo 17, and along with commander Eugene Cernan, one of the last two men to set foot on the lunar surface, in December 1972. After leaving Nasa in 1975, he was elected to the US Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. He is also known for speaking out against the scientific consensus on climate change. David Scott, the commander of the Apollo 15, is one of just four men alive who have walked on the Moon - but he was also one of the first to drive on it too. In 1971, Scott and crewmate James Irwin tested out the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), ""Man's First Wheels on the Moon"" as it was called. Travelling at speeds up to 8 mph (12 km/h) the LRV allowed astronauts to travel large distances from the lunar lander much quicker than they could walk. ""On a first mission you never know whether it's going to work,"" he later recalled. ""The greatest thrill was to get it out, turn it on, and it actually worked."" After returning from the Moon, Scott worked in various management roles within Nasa, before joining the private sector. He has also acted as consultant on several film and television projects, including Apollo 13 and the HBO miniseries From The Earth To The Moon. As commander of Apollo 10 in May 1969, Tom Stafford led the final test mission for the programme before the planned landing of Apollo 11. On that mission, Stafford and pilot Eugene Cernan became the first crew to fly the lunar landing module outside the Earth's orbit. Shortly after his return, Stafford was appointed chief of the Astronaut Office, a role he held for almost two years. In 1975 he was Nasa's commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, the first joint space mission between the US and then-Soviet Union, and a precursor to the International Space Station. His Soviet counterpart, Alexey Leonov, became a lifelong friend. Together they had participated in the momentous handshake in orbit, something that would have been unimaginable at the height of the space race.

Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr were both recognised for their acting performances, while Christopher Nolan won best director. Succession scored the most wins in the TV categories following its acclaimed fourth and final season. Meanwhile, Barbie won the inaugural box office achievement award, after grossing $1.4bn (£1.13bn) worldwide. There were two wins each for Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers and Poor Things, and one for Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. The latter film's star Lily Gladstone was named best drama actress, making her the first indigenous person to win the award, something she described as ""historic"". Oppenheimer star Murphy paid tribute to Nolan's ""rigour, focus and dedication"" in making the film, which grossed $954m (£750m) at the box office and won best drama film at the ceremony. The biopic also won awards for best score and best supporting actor for Downey Jr, who portrayed US government official Lewis Strauss. Downey Jr acknowledged the film's unlikely box office success in his acceptance speech, joking: ""A sweeping story about the ethical dilemma of nuclear weapons grosses $1bn?"" The actor continued: ""Dozens of folks have come up to me since the summer time saying I was unrecognisably subtle as Lewis Strauss. To my fellow nominees, let's not pretend this is a compliment."" He also referred to the changes made to the Golden Globes membership following a scandal over corruption and a lack of diversity. ""Thanks for changing your game,"" he told the voting body. Murphy, who also starred in Peaky Blinders, played J Robert Oppenheimer in the film - the theoretical physicist described as the father of the atomic bomb. In his acceptance speech, Murphy said: ""I knew the first time I walked on Christopher Nolan's set that it was different. ""I could tell by the level of rigour, focus, dedication, and the complete lack of seating options for actors,"" he joked, ""that I was in the hands of a visionary director."" Murphy also joked about the number of Irish nominees in awards season this year - his fellow nominees in the category included Saltburn's Barry Keoghan and All of us Strangers star Andrew Scott. ""To all my fellow nominees, whether you're Irish or not, you're all legends, I salute you,"" Murphy said. Killers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone began her acceptance speech by speaking Algonquian language Blackfoot. The actress comes from a Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana. ""I just spoke a bit of Blackfeet language, the beautiful community nation that raised me, encouraged me to keep doing this,"" she told the audience. ""I'm here with my mum, who, even though she's not Blackfeet, worked tirelessly to get Blackfeet into our classroom. ""This award is a historic one. I'm so grateful I can speak even a little bit of my language, because in this business, Native actors used to speak their lines in English, and then their sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera."" In Killers of the Flower Moon, Gladstone plays Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman whose family members are brutally murdered as part of a plot by white settlers to move in on their land and take their fortune, fuelled by greed over oil. Succession was the big winner in the TV categories - following the fourth and final season of the drama about a media mogul and his children who battle for control of his company. Kieran Culkin, who played Roman Roy in the series, was named best leading TV actor - an award previously won by his co-stars Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong. ""I was nominated for a Golden Globe like 20 years ago,"" he recalled, ""and when that moment passed, I thought, 'I'll never be in this room again'. ""I accepted I was never going to be on this stage. But thanks to Succession.... this is a nice moment."" His co-star Sarah Snook was named best leading TV actress, and told the audience: ""This show has changed my life."" British star Matthew Macfadyen was also named best supporting actor for his role in the show. ""I just adored every second of playing the human grease stain that is Tom Wambsgans,"" he joked. The critically acclaimed show also won best drama series - seen as the night's top prize in the television categories. Barbie won the cinematic and box office achievement award - a newly added category this year which aimed to increase recognition of commercially successful films. ""We would like to dedicate to every single person on the planet who dressed up and went to the greatest place on earth - the movie theatres,"" said the film's star Margot Robbie. ""And thank you so much to the Golden Globes for creating an award that celebrates movie fans. This is a movie about Barbie but it's also a movie about humans. We made it for you, and we made it with love, and thank you for loving it back."" Billie Eilish also won best original song for What Was I Made For? - one of three songs which were nominated from the film's soundtrack. ""It was exactly a year ago when I was shown the movie, and I was very miserable and depressed at the time, and writing that song kind of saved me a little bit,"" Eilish said. Da'Vine Joy Randolph won best supporting actress for her portrayal in The Holdovers of a woman suffering immense grief after the death of her son. ""Mary, you have changed my life, you have made me feel seen in so many ways,"" she said, referring to the character she plays. ""And I hope I helped you all find your inner Mary, because there is a little bit of her in all of us."" Addressing the film's director Alexander Payne, she said: ""Thank you for giving me the opportunity to play this beautiful and flawed woman."" Her co-star Paul Giamatti was named best leading actor in a drama. He plays a teacher who is forced to stay in his boarding school over Christmas to look after the children who are not returning home for the holidays. Climbing the steps to the stage to accept the award, he joked his ""knees were shot"", adding: ""I'm never going to be in John Wick 5 at this rate."" He too paid tribute to Payne, calling him ""Alexander the Great, who for some mysterious reason continues to have enormous faith in me and I don't know why"". Giamatti concluded: ""[The Holdovers] is a movie about a teacher. My whole family are teachers, all of them going back generations. Teachers are good people, you've got to respect them, they do a tough job, so this is for teachers as well."" Courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall won best foreign language film and best screenplay. Its director Justine Triet recalled the process of writing the film with her partner Arthur Harari during lockdown. ""We were in the pandemic,"" she recalled, ""and my life partner and I, we spent our days co-writing the screenplay for Anatomy of a Fall, stuck in our apartment - and strangely, nobody died."" Other winners in the TV categories include Steven Yeun and Ali Wong - who were both recognised for their performances in Beef - and The Bear's Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri. Elsewhere, Elizabeth Debicki was named best supporting actress in a TV series for her portrayal of Princess Diana in The Crown. She thanked the show's producers ""for trusting me with this part"". She thanked her ""pretend children"" Ed McVey and Luther Ford, who play Prince William and Prince Harry on the show respectively. Emma Stone was named best actress in a musical or comedy for her performance in Poor Things, which also won best musical or comedy film. Poor Things sees Stone play a young woman, Bella Baxter, who goes on a journey of self discovery and sexual awakening as she travels around the world. ""Bella falls in love with life itself, rather than a person, she accepts the good and bad in equal measure,"" Stone said in her acceptance speech. ""And that really made me look at life differently, and that all of it counts. She has stayed with me deeply, so this means the world to me."" She thanked director Yorgos Lanthimos, saying she would be ""forever be grateful that we met"", and writer Tony McNamara, to whom she joked: ""I love getting to say this dialogue, and I love getting to horrify you with my Australian accent.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67894917,Peregrine lander: Vulcan rocket launches US private Moon mission,"An US spacecraft has launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to try to perform a controlled landing on the Moon.",2024-01-08,"An US spacecraft has launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to try to perform a controlled landing on the Moon. It's aiming to become the first American mission in 51 years to complete a soft touch-down, and the first ever by a private company. Astrobotic's robotic lander, called Peregrine, has been contracted by Nasa to carry five scientific instruments. These will study the Moon's surface environment ahead of human missions later this decade. Peregrine is part of a stampede of spacecraft that will attempt to put themselves on the lunar surface in 2024 - possibly as many as eight different projects, including from Japan and China. Astrobotic's venture was sent on its way by a brand new rocket called Vulcan, which left its Florida pad at 02:18 EST (07:18 GMT). Fifty minutes later, after a flawless flight, the Pittsburgh-based company's craft was ejected on a path to the Moon. It will take a few weeks to get itself into position to attempt the touch-down. The planned 23 February descent will target a smooth lava plain on the Moon's near-side known as Sinus Viscositatis, or ""Bay of Stickiness"" - a reference to the type of volcanic material that may have built nearby hills. Not since the last Apollo mission in 1972 has there been any US effort to place a spacecraft gently on the lunar surface - although US probes have been deliberately crashed into the Moon for one reason or another in the meantime. Running surface operations is back on the agenda because Nasa wishes soon to resume astronaut missions, and it is going to use robots from commercial partners to deliver scientific instrumentation, general equipment and supplies - a move the agency believes will work to reduce costs over time. Astrobotic is the first of three US companies to send a lander under this new arrangement. Two other companies, Intuitive Machines and Firefly, will follow in the coming months. Indeed, it's possible Houston-based Intuitive Machines may even beat Astrobotic to the surface because although its lander is not due to launch until mid-February, it's taking a quicker route to the Moon. All three US companies have Nasa as a ""customer"", but the agency is ""not in charge"" of their missions. It is the firms themselves who have designed the spacecraft and will be in command as the missions progress. ""This initiative is incredibly important,"" said Andy Jones, director of landers and spacecraft at Astrobotic. ""It's allowed a small company like Astrobotic to deliver a lander to the Moon. We'd never have been able to achieve it without that. But the best thing is it's bringing a lot more creative minds, new minds, new thinking to the table, and that will help accelerate the technologies needed to get us back to the Moon and have a more robust presence on the Moon."" Nasa's payloads on Peregrine are focused on preparations for the later human presence on the lunar surface. The Peregrine Ion Mass Spectrometer (PITMS), for example, will try to understand better how water moves across the Moon. Water is seen as a potential resource for future astronauts, either for drinking or as the basis of a rocket fuel. The main sensor in PITMS was built in the UK by the Open University (OU) and RAL-Space. The OU's Dr Simeon Barber led the development. ""Water is really important for astronauts to drink, for sanitation. It's really the key molecule for unlocking the future and a new way of doing space exploration,"" he told BBC News. Because Nasa is classed as just a customer on the mission, Astrobotic has been free to sell payload space to others. The most significant of these additional items are a number of small rovers, including a clutch of tiny two-wheeled robots from Mexico. There are also cultural items onboard, such as photos, drawings, plaques and audio recordings, but, controversially, there is a consignment of cremated human remains, too. Two companies have small ""memorial"" capsules on Peregrine, one of which contains the DNA of renowned British science-fiction writer Arthur C Clarke. This is something that has drawn the ire of the Navajo Nation, the North American indigenous people, who regard the Moon as sacred. They've appealed to Nasa to stop the mission, which they see as an act of desecration. The first of 2024's lunar touch-down attempts will be conducted by the Japanese space agency (Jaxa) and is expected on 15 January. Jaxa's Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) will target a location near Shioli crater, which is just south of the Moon's equator on its near-side. China will continue its recent exploration efforts on the Moon by sending a mission to the far-side to bring some of the rocks there back to Earth for study. This should happen mid-year. While the focus in the coming weeks will be squarely on Peregrine's travels, It's worth reflecting also on the success of the Vulcan, which was making its maiden flight after 10 years of development. The company behind the vehicle - United Launch Alliance - has an established pedigree of putting up US national security missions and Nasa missions. Vulcan will take on this work as ULA's current stable of rockets is retired. The company's president and CEO, Tory Bruno, couldn't hide his joy at the conclusion of the new rocket's ascent. ""Yeehaw!"" the executive, who is often seen in a cowboy hat, shouted. ""I am so thrilled. I am so proud of this team. Oh my gosh, this has been years of hard work.""","['Space exploration', 'Pittsburgh', 'Exploration of the Moon', 'Nasa', 'The Moon']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F0C9/production/_132214616_screenshot2024-01-05at14.20.45.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/5489/production/_132214612_eugene_cernan_at_the_lm_apollo_17.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DFA3/production/_132215275_mons_gruithuisen_4145_h1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14B7C/production/_132206848_18f5e233-e10a-4333-bf70-646d5fca1eb9.jpg']",['N/A'],World,US & Canada

The instrument, part developed by RAL Space in Harwell, Oxfordshire, will analyse the atmosphere near the lunar surface and look for drinking water. It is onboard the Vulcan rocket which launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 07:18 GMT (02:18 EST). The instrument could prove vital for sustainable human space exploration. Peregrine Mission One is being carried out by the US space company Astrobotic on behalf of NASA, and is carrying five scientific instruments to help prepare for human missions to the Moon later this decade. Astrobotic's robotic lander, Peregrine, aims to become the first American mission in 51 years to complete a soft touch-down, and the first ever by a private company. Peregrine is part of a stampede of spacecraft that will attempt to put themselves on the lunar surface in 2024 - possibly as many as eight different projects, including from Japan and China. Peregrine Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (PITMS) has been developed by RAL Space in partnership with the Open University in Milton Keyes and NASA. RAL Space also designed the circuit boards to power the equipment. Production and software group leader Chris Howe said the project had been 22 months in the making and described PITMS as ""a nose that is going to sniff the lunar atmosphere"". ""I'm very, very pleased because it's the first launch of this particular rocket type,"" Mr Howe added. ""So we are saying if the instrument switches on OK when it's in space... then we will be able to say that is a success. ""The technology from PITMS will now help underpin future missions, such as the Rosalind Franklin Rover, so whilst PITMS will only operate for one lunar day on the moon, its legacy will be felt for years."" Dr Simeon Barber, Luna research scientist at the Open University, added that if useful space resources could be found and purified, they could then be used ""as drinking water for astronauts and that should make for cheaper and faster, more sustainable missions"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67907039,Fugitive Nicholas Rossi faces 15 years in jail if convicted of rape,An American fugitive who has been extradited from Scotland to the United States could face two life sentences if he is convicted of raping two women.,2024-01-08,"An American fugitive who has been extradited from Scotland to the United States could face two life sentences if he is convicted of raping two women. Nicholas Rossi is facing charges in two neighbouring jurisdictions in Utah. Prosecutors in the state say people convicted of rape are sentenced to five years to life, and typically serve between eight and 15 years. The 36-year-old is said to have faked his own death and was hiding in Scotland when he was arrested. He was discovered in a Glasgow hospital in December 2021. On Friday he left on a private flight from Edinburgh Airport after losing his final appeal against extradition. The convicted sex offender has been accused of raping a woman in the city of Orem in Utah County in 2008 and another woman in Salt Lake County later the same year. District Attorney for Salt Lake County, Sim Gill, told BBC Scotland News that Rossi will face separate trials for each allegation. His office and their counterparts in Utah County will decide who should prosecute him first. The Salt Lake County case involves a woman who came forward in January 2022 after Utah County requested Rossi's extradition from Scotland. She has alleged that they met through a dating app in 2008 when she was 26 years old. Court documents say the woman felt that Rossi was ""smart, university-educated and interesting."" She said they were discussing marriage when she started to have doubts about their relationship. Mr Gill said: ""After a period of time, she started to realise some things didn't add up. ""She started to pull back from that relationship and it's alleged that he became very angry with her in a parking lot. ""They decided to go home. He took her up to the bedroom and locked the door and sexually assaulted her against her will. It's alleged that he raped her."" Mr Gill said the length of jail time served by a convicted prisoner is decided by the parole board. He said: ""Rape is a first-degree felony in our jurisdiction, so the maximum could be up to life in prison, depending on the history of the person and the underlying facts. ""If he's in the custody, he's not going anywhere, so we will just bide our time and prosecute when our turn comes. ""The injury that is often suffered by victims of sexual crime is something that they never lose, and so trying to find a measure of justice is critical, regardless of when it happened."" The court papers from the Salt Lake County case say Rossi has been involved in ""criminal cases of sex assault, harassment and possible kidnapping in Rhode Island, Ohio, Utah and Massachusetts."" As an untried prisoner, Rossi will be held in a half-empty jail on the outskirts of a town called Spanish Fork. With the snow-capped Wasatch Mountains in the distance, Utah County Jail was designed to not look like a prison when it was built 30 years ago. Instead it resembles a community hospital, although a new security fence is being erected around the perimeter. Sergeant Garrett Dutson of Utah County Sheriff's Office said the jail has a capacity of 1,000 but is currently holding around 450 inmates. It houses prisoners who're waiting to go on trial and those serving sentences of under 12 months. ""There's multiple crimes from shoplifting to murder, from domestic violence and assault to child abuse, to sex crimes,"" said Sgt Dutson. ""I would say most criminals in our jails are there for drug-related crimes. ""I think the conditions are pretty good. We have programmes for the inmates. ""There's medical and educational things, there's religion, things like that to keep them occupied. ""They do spend a lot of time in lockdown. They can average 20 hours a day in their cell."" Rossi claimed to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight when he was fighting extradition, but a sheriff said fingerprints proved he was Nicholas Rossi.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been inspecting the jets after part of an Alaska Airlines plane's fuselage fell off on Friday. The FAA said its first priority was ""keeping the flying public safe"". Boeing's CEO Dave Calhoun told staff that its response ""is and must be"" the focus of the company. Thousands of passengers saw their flights cancelled after major US airlines grounded dozens of the jets. ""We have grounded the affected airplanes, and they will remain grounded until the FAA is satisfied that they are safe,"" the FAA said in a statement on Sunday. Boeing also said that it will hold an all-employee meeting about safety on Tuesday to address its response to the incident. ""When serious accidents like this occur, it is critical for us to work transparently with our customers and regulators to understand and address the causes of the event, and to ensure they don't happen again,"" Mr Calhoun said. Disruptions have primarily affected flights in the US. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s used in the US are operated by United Airlines and Alaska, while Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico have also grounded jets of the same model for inspections. Alaska grounded 65 planes, and said on Sunday that it had cancelled 163 flights, or 21%. Around 25,000 people were affected. The airline said travel disruptions from the grounding of some of its planes is expected to last until at least mid-week.United has grounded 79 planes, and said on Sunday it had cancelled about 180 flights. Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for the plug door - which they believe fell to the ground in the western suburbs of Portland - and have appealed to the public to help find the panel. During Friday's incident, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began an emergency descent, according to flight tracking data. Passengers on board said a large section of the plane's outer shell fell to the ground shortly after take-off. Images sent to news outlets show the night sky and lights of Portland visible through the gap in the fuselage, with insulation material and other debris also seen. One passenger said the gap was ""as wide as a refrigerator"" while another said a child's shirt was ripped off in the wind as the plane made its emergency landing. The plane, carrying 177 passengers and crew, landed safely back in Portland. Alaska said several passengers were injured, but not seriously. Boeing's 737 Max has been described as ""the most scrutinised transport aircraft in history"" after a series of safety issues. The Max was grounded in March 2019 for a year and a half after two of the type crashed in similar circumstances to each other, killing those on board. More recently, Boeing said it would increase the pace of 737 Max deliveries after resolving a supply error that required it to conduct lengthy inspections of new planes and its inventory. About 1,300 737 Max aircraft have been delivered to customers, Boeing data shows. Last month, the FAA urged airlines to inspect Max models for a possible loose bolt in rudder control systems.","['Aviation accidents and incidents', 'Air travel', 'United States', 'Aviation safety', 'Oregon', 'Boeing', 'United Airlines', 'Portland']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/07F3/production/_132253020_portland_flight_reroute_2x640-nc.png'],['N/A'],World,US & Canada

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67918976,Ministers seeking to speed up Post Office appeals,The government is looking at ways to fast-track the appeals of hundreds of sub-postmasters caught up in the Post Office IT scandal.,2024-01-08,"The government is looking at ways to fast-track the appeals of hundreds of sub-postmasters caught up in the Post Office IT scandal. More than 700 people received criminal convictions after faulty software made it look like money was missing. To date, 93 convictions have been overturned and only 30 have finalised compensation with the government. Business Minister Kevin Hollinrake said plans to speed up the remaining cases would be announced ""very shortly"". Mr Hollinrake said options including new legislation were being considered. On Monday, Mr Hollinrake met Justice Secretary Alex Chalk to discuss what he called ""one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our history"". ""We have devised some options for resolving the outstanding criminal convictions with much more pace,"" the minister said. But he added, Mr Chalk would ""need to speak to senior figures in the judiciary about these options before we put them forward"". He said the pair had discussed ""at length"" the possibility of changing the law in order to deal with those who are still waiting to clear their names. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - based on information from a computer system called Horizon. Many maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly raised issues with Horizon. But some went to prison for false accounting and theft. Many were financially ruined. The government is also looking at changing the rules round private prosecutions, after the Post Office pursued its former employees through the courts. Campaigners called for the Post Office to be prevented from taking part in appeals against the convictions of former sub-postmasters. Sir Keir Starmer has called for the Post Office to be stripped of prosecution powers and these to be ""handed to the Crown Prosecution Service"". ""The remaining convictions, need to be looked at en masse,"" he added. The government also announced retired judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom would chair an independent panel overseeing compensation payments to those whose convictions have been overturned. Two former justice secretaries have called for legislation to be brought in as soon as possible. Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the justice secretary under Tony Blair, said the government could introduce new laws ""tomorrow and there would be no resistance in parliament"". ""It's an absolutely shocking scandal that's been there for years and years, and now it's at the top of the political agenda. Everyone agrees it will take years to get rid of those other convictions unless there is a change in procedure."" In a letter to The Times, Sir Robert Buckland, Mr Chalk's predecessor, said: ""Too many sub-postmasters have already died without seeing justice being done, so there is no more time to be lost."" Speaking in the House of commons Sir Robert said he would support a new law to ""create a presumption of innocence"" for those convicted due to the faulty software. Alan Bates, a former sub-postmaster who has led efforts for justice, told the BBC he believed a ""resolution"" was ""closer"". Mr Bates, played by Toby Young in a recent ITV drama about the scandal, said the years it had taken to get to this point had been ""frustrating"", but added the ITV show had enabled a ""broader audience"" to understand what happened. ""The most important thing is for government to make sure that this financial redress goes through at speed to get it there as soon as possible, not wait, not spend money with lawyers time and time again,"" Mr Bates said. ""We still have to keep the pressure on and we have got to push people and we've got to get the whole thing moving and keep the momentum."" ""The group has lost 60 or 70 people since we started all this. People need to get on with lives, they need to be able to draw a line under it - they will never forget it, but they have got to be able to get on and unfortunately they do need money to keep them going. ""This money is only what they are owed. This is money to put them back in a position what they would have been had Post Office not done what they did to them."" There has also been a campaign to strip former Post Office boss Paula Vennells of her CBE over the scandal. Ms Vennells, who was Post Office chief executive between 2012 and 2019, has been urged to forfeit her honour. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesman  said: ""The prime minister shares the public's feeling of outrage on this issue. He would strongly support the Forfeiture Committee if it chose to review the case."" The Forfeiture Committee can recommend honours are stripped if a person has brought the system into disrepute. Ms Vennells has said previously that she remained ""truly sorry for the suffering caused to wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and their families"".

People in Stockport, Greater Manchester, have reported heaps of red meat and chicken dumped in the Reddish area, often on an almost weekly basis. Labour candidate for Reddish South Joanna Williams said the ""strange phenomenon"" was causing concern. Stockport Council said it had arranged to clean up the meat when reported. Sightings have mostly come from around the Manchester Road Park area and Whitehill industrial estate, but also near the Heaton Moor train station. Ms Williams told the Local Democracy Reporting Service residents were starting to worry about the potential reasons behind the ""bizarre behaviour"". ""People are really worried about it, about whether there's any poison in it and if it's intended for dogs who might get sick if they eat it,"" the councillor said. ""My opinion, if I'm honest, is that it's businesses cutting costs on legitimate disposal practices during the cost of living crises and they may be unaware that what they are doing is essentially fly tipping even though the product might be seen as biodegradable."" Stockport councillor Frankie Singleton, a Liberal Democrat and cabinet member, said the council is monitoring the situation along with the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, and Natural England. She said the authority had received no reports since before Christmas and had not heard of any dogs or other wildlife falling ill. The community found the meat mystery ""very distressing and baffling"", said Ms Williams, who has passed on community reports to Reddish police station.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the pair had a casual sexual relationship after meeting in 2019. Mr Diamond said he was looking forward to resuming his career. Sunderland confirmed he would return to the club. The winger, who had been suspended by the Black Cats since being charged in March 2023, said the verdict marked his ""total exoneration"". Speaking outside court, the 23-year-old said it had been a ""hugely challenging"" 18 months but thanked his legal team, family and friends for their efforts and support. The court had heard Mr Diamond and the woman, who cannot be identified, had an on-off relationship which was ""95%"" sex. On 7 May she went to his home for a ""cuddle"" but claimed the footballer ""tried to force himself"" upon her. Mr Diamond said the encounter was entirely consensual and he stopped touching her when she asked him to. His legal team argued the woman developed feelings for him and was upset when he did not want to make their relationship more serious. Mr Diamond's lawyer Eleanor Laws KC said the winger, who was suspended by Sunderland and had a loan spell at Lincoln City cancelled after he was charged in March 2023, had endured a ""nightmare"". The jury of nine women and three men took less than an hour to deliver not guilty verdicts on both counts. There were cheers from the public gallery and Mr Diamond looked visibly relieved when the verdict was announced. A spokesman for Sunderland said Mr Diamond, who also previously had loan spells at Harrogate Town, would ""now return"" to the Black Cats' Academy of Light training centre and ""resume footballing activity"". Mr Diamond grew up in Washington and signed his first professional contract with Sunderland at the age of 16. His trial heard from several coaches, including former Sunderland players Michael Proctor and Paul Thirlwell, who said he was a talented footballer and well-liked by his fellow players and staff. They said he was ""humble"" and ""honest"" and treated everyone with respect, with Mr Proctor saying he was ""incredibly shocked"" by the rape accusation. Mr Diamond said he met his accuser on Tinder when he was 19 and both agreed to have a casual relationship based on sex. He told jurors on reflection he was ""maybe naïve"" to think that would work and he rejected the woman's requests to do more boyfriend-type things, such as going for walks. They would meet up in their cars until Mr Diamond moved out from his parents and into his own home in November 2021. He said he was ""regretful"" about his ""whole attitude and immaturity towards the relationship"" and the ""blindness towards how she actually felt"".

James Atkinson, 23, became unwell after eating food ordered from the Newcastle restaurant Dadyal on 10 July 2020. A Home Office pathologist told the hearing that he died from anaphylaxis as a result of peanut ingestion. The inquest also heard that Mr Atkinson, originally from Leeds, told paramedics he was about to die before he fell unconscious. Mr Atkinson, who was a computer programmer living in Jesmond, Newcastle, had ordered a chicken tikka masala pizza, chips and Indian dishes with his flatmate via the delivery app Deliveroo. He had searched the internet for likely ingredients in certain foods, the inquest was told. The former Newcastle University student was said to have eaten some chips and less than one slice of the pizza before he realised something was wrong as he became rapidly unwell. While his flatmate looked for his EpiPen, unsuccessfully, Mr Atkinson rang for an ambulance. Craig Hassall KC, representing the family, said that when the paramedics arrived, Mr Atkinson reportedly told them as he struggled to breathe that he was going to die. Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton outlined the background to her inquiry into his death, and said Mr Atkinson was ""gasping for air"" when the ambulance crew arrived. By the time he had been helped downstairs, he was assessed to have a Glasgow coma score of three, Dr Bolton said, and was ""profoundly unconscious"". Mr Atkinson was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle at 20:40 BST and died at 21:21 BST, despite the help of medics. Toxicology tests showed he had no alcohol or other drugs in his system at the time and so his decision-making ability was not impaired, the inquest heard. Dr Bolton said Mr Atkinson was known to be ""usually very good"" at monitoring his allergies, having been diagnosed with a peanut allergy 10 years earlier. Examination of the uneaten takeaway food also detected the presence of peanuts, as did analysis of a ""nut mix"" at the Dadyal restaurant which supplied it, Dr Bolton said. She gave the cause of death as anaphylaxis following peanut ingestion. Coroner Karen Dilks asked Dr Bolton if the outcome would have been different had an EpiPen been found to use on Mr Atkinson. The pathologist said: ""Even with the appropriate use of an EpiPen, there's no guarantee that an individual will survive, but it certainly increases your chances."" When Dr Bolton answered Mr Hassall's comment about Mr Atkinson saying he was going to die, she said: ""He experienced his difficulty in breathing and he was becoming aware it was getting worse, (and) individuals do sometimes say 'I am going to die'. ""Medically, that is taken very seriously. Everybody is still doing everything they can to stop that being the case, and, in fact, to prove the individual wrong."" Mr Atkinson's parents, Jill and Stuart, said their son's ""sudden death has left an insurmountable hole in our hearts"". ""James had a gift of making others happy, checking in on friends and offering support when needed,"" they told the hearing. ""To be in his company with his amazing sense of humour and infectious laugh was a privilege. ""First on the dance floor and last to leave, James lived life to its fullest but also had a sensitive and thoughtful side,"" they continued. ""His whole family meant the world to him. He was loving, kind and caring,"" they added. The inquest, which is set to last two weeks, continues. Follow BBC North East  on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Commissioner Andy Roe said difficult financial decisions could divert funds from schemes intended to address the brigade's cultural problems. Institutional misogyny and racism within the LFB were outlined in a November 2022 review. He also told a London assembly committee stations would not be closed. Mr Roe said fire station closures would be an irresponsible course of action given the growing number of ""emerging risks"" in London, such as wildfires, flooding and the impact of climate change. The review, conducted by former chief crown prosecutor for the north-west Nazir Afzal, included accounts ranging from women being groped to firefighters having their helmets filled with urine. Mr Roe recently told London assembly members that he was committed to a ""culture change"" within the LFB and was working to create an ""inclusive workplace"", including through improved training of officers and the creation of an external complaints service. But at Monday's meeting of the assembly's budget and performance committee, the commissioner warned that tight finances could mean less funding for those improvements. He said this would depend on how much of the brigade's budget has to be devoted to increased pay for staff - with the increase decided at a national level following negotiations with the Fire Brigades Union. In the event that a higher than expected increase is agreed this year, Mr Roe said the brigade would likely be forced to ""slow down or stop"" some of its ""investment activity"". He added: ""It might be about slowing down some of the changes to training, it might be about looking at the level of investment we're putting into change around culture, for example."" He pledged though that he would not look to find ""easy answers"" in the search for savings by removing fire engines or closing fire stations. ""I am not of that mind. I think they have to be safeguarded at all costs,"" Mr Roe said. ""We do a quarter of all fire and rescue service calls in the UK on a daily basis, over 210,000 a year. We hold all the risk, in pretty much every metric, in comparison to other force areas [across the country] - we are very different."" Baroness Fiona Twycross, London's deputy mayor for fire and resilience, told committee members that the national negotiations over firefighter pay would not necessarily have concluded by the end of the mayor's budget-setting process in a few weeks' time.

Debbie Wilkins, who owns Norton Court Farm near Gloucester, receives a government grant to set aside 300 acres (121 hectares) as a floodplain. She is one of hundreds of farmers around the country who now let the floodplains ""do their job"". ""It takes the pressure off the river and protects the properties below us,"" Ms Wilkins explained. Instead of building barriers to try to keep the water out, she keeps the floodplain land as grass and hay, which won't be destroyed like arable crops. She said the pastures that are allowed to flood have ""brilliant wildlife"" and are ""species rich"". ""Also we're producing food on it. They're working quite hard, these fields."" The government's Environment Land Management scheme offers incentives to farmers to boost sustainable practices. Prof Nicola Cannon from the Royal Agricultural University said: ""I think many farmers are thinking very carefully about making their farms more resilient."" ""We're seeing more freak weather events, including high levels of rainfall causing flooding."" She explained farmers were considering ""how they manage their land"" to minimise risk but also the ""opportunities"" to help communities downstream. Ms Wilkins grew up on the farm she now runs and remembers as a child they had a ""proper flood"" every four or five years. ""And now we're getting two or three a year,"" she added. She said they farm a third of the land in a more ""gentle way"", allowing the floodplains she usually uses for cattle grazing ""to do their job"". Ms Wilkins said, however, that it does cause them some ""hassle"", including have to move the cattle very quickly, as well as there being a ""tide line of rubbish"" in the water. She explained the plants underneath the flood waters had ""been there a long time and they are not your traditional high-yielding ryegrass"". ""These are floodplain meadows, species rich. They have evolved to cope with being flooded and so they'll come back in the summer. ""We'll have lovely fields full of flowers and grass, which we'll cut for hay and afterwards the cattle will come and graze them. That's the cycle."" Prof Cannon explained this method was easier for livestock farmers, who can move their stock, rather than those growing crops. She explained the residual silt from flood water leaves some ""fertility"" behind, which can boost grass growth and biodiversity. The professor of agriculture said flooded farmland was a ""very traditional practice"", adding: ""It's only in more recent times that we've seen this land converted to cropping where it's been so much more vulnerable to erosion."" Ms Wilkins, like many other farmers, has other fields with arable crops that have also flooded, at a cost of thousands of pounds. The national Farmer's Union (NFU) says farmers who are expected to let fields of crops flood to protect towns should be compensated. Zoe Moore, an environmental policy adviser specialising in flood management at the NFU, said many farms were still recovering from Storm Gerrit and Storm Babet when Storm Henk hit last week. ""So this has, sort of, been a double hit for them. Lots will have recently planted crops that are now going to be rotting in the ground or not had the chance to grow.

But the town's temporary flood barriers were taken out of use last year sparking concern among locals. Environment Agency Ian Withers told the BBC: ""There is a strong argument for why those temporary barriers were not the right solution for the town. ""There was a safety issue with them and it was a far worst prospect to have them in place and fail than to use them. Now there is a longer term plan for Bradford on Avon and that needs to be fully funded."" Wiltshire Councillor Tim Trimble said although Bradford on Avon is ""getting back on its feet"", it could ""do with a lot more help"". ""They can deal with it but it is still a huge disruption to their businesses, especially when you have got the cost of living crisis, rising energy costs. ""They are struggling all the way along and now they get this as well. They need more help, frankly,"" he said. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-67910702,Flooding misery in Berkshire as Thames levels continue to rise,"More than 40 flood warnings and alerts remain in place in Berkshire, with the River Thames at Reading reaching its highest level in 20 years.",2024-01-08,"More than 40 flood warnings and alerts remain in place in Berkshire, with the River Thames at Reading reaching its highest level in 20 years. It comes after a week of heavy rainfall last week, some of which came as part of Storm Henk. Lee Goodwin, who runs the Velolife Cafe in Wargrave, said his business was ""completely under water"". The Environment Agency warned that river levels would ""continue to rise slowly"" in the coming days. The Thames reached levels of 7.54m on Sunday afternoon, topping the previous high of 7.41m recorded in January 2003. Among many home and business owners hit by flooding, Mr Goodwin said he had not been able to access his cafe since Saturday to assess the damage. ""We've spent the last week watching the water rise and watching it come into the cafe,"" he said. ""It's very difficult - you put your heart and soul into something, get it up and running, and then watching it slowly disappear is really difficult. ""It's really emotional - it's our livelihood that goes into rebuilding it again."" The Mill Theatre at Sonning had to cancel performances when its riverside building was deluged with water. Caroline Richardson, emergency planning officer for West Berkshire Council, said the past week had been ""particularly challenging for the community"". ""All the communities along all our rivers - the Pang, Kennet and Lambourn and the Thames - have issues,"" she said. ""There are road closures across the area and properties flooded. It's going to be like that for some time. ""This is a long haul we've got unfortunately."" She said rivers such as the Lambourn and Kennet, which are fed by groundwater, would take ""a lot, lot longer to reduce"". Jon Mansbridge, of The Environment Agency, said the flooding was the result of ""significant rainfall"" in the Thames catchment over recent months. ""When Storm Henk came through we saw some really heavy downpours for consistent periods of time. All that water has to work its way down the whole of the catchment area from Gloucestershire out to sea past London,"" he said. ""The levels have reached their highest around Wallingford area on the Thames, but are going to continue to rise slowly downstream - Reading, Newbury down through into Surrey."" Residents who are worried about their homes are urged to check the Environment Agency website for more information and help. Flooding on the rail network also continues to cause disruption. GWR said there would be disruption on the line between Reading and Bedwyn for the remainder of Monday. It said rail replacement buses were running between Newbury and Bedwyn, Newbury and Hungerford and Newbury and Newbury Racecourse. Newbury Station was flooded after heavy rain on Thursday night.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-67909880,Rising River Thames floods Surrey homes and businesses,Homes and businesses have been flooded in Surrey amid rising water levels in the River Thames.,2024-01-08,"Homes and businesses have been flooded in Surrey amid rising water levels in the River Thames. Almost the entire Surrey stretch of the river is still at risk of bursting its banks, according to the Environment Agency map. There are currently 23 flood warnings in place in the county, 20 of which relate to the Thames. Runnymede Borough Council has set up a rest centre in Addlestone in case households need to be evacuated. The council said flooding conditions were likely to continue and while a major incident had not been declared, flood warnings were in place. Nick Moore, who lives next to the river at Runnymede, said he was standing in his garden in water up to his knees and about 20 other properties were similarly affected. He said he had to evacuate his mother from a cottage in his garden which was flooded with water that was ""full of sewage"". He said no-one from the council or Environment Agency had been out to see them. One of his neighbours, Dr Cameron Nichol, had been unable to get to work as a GP on Monday morning, after his property flooded. He said he, his wife, children and dog had to leave the property at about 05:30 GMT on Sunday. ""There is water in the garage and it is about to breech into my house,"" he said. ""I have had to move all my belongings [upstairs]. All of this could have been avoided."" He also said flood warnings were insufficient and flood management was poor. Chertsey resident Hannah Rush said her home was flooded and she had received no help. She said she contacted Runnymede Borough Council and asked for sandbags and was told they had none and she should phone 999, while Surrey County Council told her they could not help. Ms Rush, whose home was flooded when the Thames burst its banks in 2014, blamed the latest floods on the Environment Agency for opening flood gates on the Thames further upstream. She said: ""I have two cabins that are completely ruined. We are pumping it and stopping it from coming in the house. If it gets in the house it will be the same as it was in 2014."" In Staines-upon-Thames, resident Ian Swinglehurst said: ""Welcome to Staines-under-Thames."" He said: ""The river came up overnight. We narrowly escaped levels seen in 2014."" He said a flood relief scheme, the River Thames Scheme, that was supposed to protect the area, had been ""cancelled"". He said the scheme had been discussed repeatedly since the 1990s and never built. After communities were flooded in 2014, flood victims called for a reprofiling of the river bed, to speed up the flow and increase capacity, but he said this had not been done. Surrey County Council has previously said it was working with the Environment Agency and local borough councils to deliver The River Thames Scheme, with statutory consultation expected in early 2024. Following residents' criticisms, Surrey County Council referred the BBC to the Environment Agency. Runnymede council leader Tom Gracey, said: ""I strongly encourage anyone who lives near the Thames or Bourne rivers or near flood plains to be flood ready. ""Check you have key documents to hand like insurance policies, move your car to higher ground if you believe you may be affected and think about where you could go if you do need to leave your home. ""Most importantly though, do not wait until your home floods before you act. If you think flooding is likely based on the physical conditions around you or past experience, contact the emergency services and prepare to evacuate."" He said frontline services had been reviewed, Meals at Home would continue and bin collections would continue unless roads were actually flooded. A rest centre has been set up in Addlestone if households need to be evacuated and a community transport service is ready to move people there, he said.

The bird was first sighted in Mr Wood's garden on Wednesday. Since the initial sighting, the bird moved to an area of scrubland and reedbed next to an industrial estate. Mr Wood, who is the president of the Essex Birdwatching Society, said bird-lovers had travelled from as far as Scotland and Wales to see it. ""It has continued to be a very surreal experience.

The Soaring Dragons, based at Loughborough Boat Club, discovered three of their boats had broken free after Storm Henk arrived on Tuesday. The team has since located two of the smaller boats but the largest of the three, a 40ft (12.1m) racing boat, is yet to be found. The last reported sighting was near the City Ground in Nottingham. The group's chairperson Ella Smith has been dragon-boating for eight years and said she had ""never seen anything like"" the floods that saw the boats become untethered. One of the smaller boats was found at Sutton Bonington in Nottinghamshire and has since been retrieved, while an O1 Canoe was located at a private residence near Kegworth, Leicestershire, and is due to be returned. The missing boat has capacity for 20 people and was reportedly last spotted on the River Trent heading past the City Ground in Nottingham. Ms Smith said: ""We think it's probably headed towards Holme Pierrepont. There's a sluice there at Colwick, so hopefully that's shut. It should be. ""We've had floods before, but nothing that's ever penetrated the top of our stands.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1dkgxg79ro,Post Office scandal: 'It's been a nightmare',N/A,2024-01-08,"Former Post Office workers have described the ""nightmare"" of their ongoing fight for justice after the Horizon scandal.Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 people were prosecuted after faulty software made it look like money was missing.Now, with the case was back in the spotlight following ITV drama, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, one former sub-postmistress said she was still waiting for compensation four years after her conviction was quashed.Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake described the scandal as ""one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation's history"" and said an independent panel would be set up to oversee any disputes relating to compensation for those whose convictions have been overturned. Over six years the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters for false accounting, theft or fraud based on information from a faulty computer system.Many maintained their innocence but some went to prison.Fewer than 100 people have so far had their convictions quashed and only 30 of these have had full compensation payments. A public inquiry is under way, but the scandal has received fresh attention in recent days.Alison Hall, from Liversedge in West Yorkshire, was sub-postmistress at Hightown Post Office, near Huddersfield, but was suspended in 2010 after the accounting system showed a shortfall of £14,800. She was threatened with prosecution for theft and ended up admitting a lesser charge of false accounting, for which she was given a criminal record and 120 hours of community service.She also had to pay the missing sum, plus £1,000 in legal costs, out of her own money.Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted?Her prosecution was finally overturned four years ago and she has been granted an interim compensation payment of £100,000, but said she was still waiting for a full payment. Describing her ordeal as ""a nightmare"" she said the attention garnered by the ITV drama was ""absolutely amazing"".She called on the government to step in to ""help us all finally get the compensation we all deserve"".She said: ""It's been going on too long now and we just want it to end. ""Thirteen years is a long time to be going through something and it's always there in the back of your head.""She said those responsible for the scandal should be held accountable and joined those calling for the former Post Office chief executive, Paula Vennells, to lose her CBE. Wendy Martin, who ran a Post Office in York, said she had started seeing ""problem after problem"" with the accounting system from the day she took it over in 2015.She said on one occasion, the system told her there was a £39,000 shortage that she was liable for.She resorted to filming herself at work to prove what was happening.She told BBC Look North: ""I put every penny that I should have earned into the system to keep it afloat.""She said she ""never slept a single night"" during her tenure and ended up with ""life-threatening"" high blood pressure.""I felt like I was dropping dead,"" she said. Ms Martin decided to close the business after 20 months and was not prosecuted.However, she said she had been left with business debts, which would take until 2056 to repay.She said she had a ""complete breakdown"" and was unable to work for two years.Ms Martin said she had only received an interim compensation payment so far and called for the compensation scheme to be removed from Post Office control.The Post Office is wholly owned by the government.Ministers met on Monday to consider ways of clearing the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters.The prime minister said the government was reviewing its options.A Post Office spokesperson has previously said it shares the ""aims of the public inquiry to get to the truth of what went wrong in the past and establish accountability"".Ms Vennells has said previously that she remains ""truly sorry for the suffering caused to wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and their families"" and would cooperate fully with the inquiry.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, external, X (formerly Twitter), external and Instagram, external.

In a letter, Mr Shapps said he was ""dismayed"" by the actions of the group. The ferry operator opted to use French shipbuilder Piriou for the multimillion-pound contract. The ISSG said using private finance meant it would introduce new vessels in 2026 using its preferred supplier. Isles of Scilly Councillor Steve Sims said the letter from Mr Shapps was ""quite surprising"". He said: ""I've seen lots of ministerial letters and this was very, very forthright."" In the letter, written in his capacity as the government's shipbuilding tsar, and addressed to the the chairman of the Isles of Scilly council, Mr Shapps said he appreciated ""how vital the lifeline passenger and freight services"" were to the Isles of Scilly's communities and businesses. The Scillonian III and freight services are in need of replacement, and Harland and Wolff (H&W) and ISSG both have plans to provide replacement passenger and freight ferries. H&W wants to build and operate two vessels using £48.4m of levelling-up money that has not yet been allocated. Meanwhile, ISSG has taken out a private £33.6m loan to pay for three new vessels. Last year H&W made an approach to buy the existing operators, the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company (ISSC), which was ""unequivocally rejected"". Mr Sims added: ""People are quite worried, because you know, it's quite a visceral thing this. ""People would like to know what's happening and when it's going to happen, so they can put their minds at rest really."" He said this was a ""huge, huge issue"" for the Isles of Scilly. The ISSG said: ""Following the government's funding route would have delayed delivery of the vessels by two years to 2028: potentially opened up the whole process to legal challenge and further delay: limited our ability to cross-subsidise Skybus, leading to a potential 25% increase in air fares and would mean the route being tendered every five years, making long-term planning difficult and not providing security to our 200-plus employees.""

Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 Post Office branch managers were convicted of fraud and theft based on faulty software, called Horizon. Parmod Kalia had his conviction overturned in May 2021 but he has not been given compensation. In 2001 Mr Kalia was sentenced to six months in jail after being falsely accused of stealing £22,000. The Post Office scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. Some sub-postmasters were wrongfully sent to prison, others were financially ruined. Some have since died. Mr Kalia is one of the 93 people who have had their convictions overturned. Only 30 people have agreed ""full and final"" compensation settlements, meaning many victims are still fighting to clear their names. Some 54 cases have resulted in either a conviction being upheld, people being refused permission to appeal, or the person appealing having withdrawn from the process. While the scandal has been public knowledge for some time, an ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which aired last week has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. For Mr Kalia, who was postmaster in Orpington, south east London, it has been a hard watch. He told BBC London: ""It brought back memories for me for the times when I've contemplated suicide. ""Seeing other people having gone through that as well, it brings back memories for me."" When the Horizon computer system was installed in his branch, he was accused of theft and taken to court after money started disappearing from his accounts in 2001. He couldn't make the books balance. Eventually in 2001 there was a hole of £22,000 in the accounts. He had reported the problem, but the Post Office still blamed him. He said he was advised by the representative of his union to find the money to fill the hole quickly to keep it out of the courts and avoid jail. He borrowed money from his mother, cashed the cheque and hoped that would be the end of it. But the Post Office still decided to prosecute him for theft based on the data from their computer accounts. He struggles to find words to describe how strange it was to be charged as an innocent man and to face the court. ""It was like being in a story or something. I really couldn't comprehend what was going on."" With hindsight pleaded not guilty and told the truth, but faced with computer evidence, his lawyer and his union representative said was his case was unwinnable and he was frightened. As was the case with hundreds of others, Mr Kalia was sentenced to jail for six months. When the judge gave the ruling he was speechless: ""I was having difficulty breathing if I'm honest. I couldn't comprehend what had just been said."" Recalling it today, he said: ""I've gone through anxiety, depression, stress, attempted suicide. My marriage was almost broken but we kept it together, I'm rebuilding it. ""My children mistrusted me. They were very young at that time and they were asking me: 'Dad, did you take the money?' I had no answer for them."" An independent public inquiry is continuing and no one has been yet brought to justice. Mr Kalia, like many others, is still fighting for full compensation. Mr Kalia has said he is taking thing day by day, and that ""compensation won't bring back more than 20 years of suffering"". Ministers are due to meet on Monday to discuss how to help the hundreds wrongly convicted in the scandal. The justice secretary, Alex Chalk, and postal minister Kevin Hollinrake were set to meet on Monday to discuss the next steps to address the scandal. A public petition to remove the CBE of the former head of the Post Office, Paula Vennells, has received more than a million signatures. The prime minister's spokesman said he would ""strongly support"" the Honours Forfeiture Committee if it were to look at taking away Ms Vennells' award. Speaking on Monday, Rishi Sunak said: ""These things obviously started a very long time ago, and it's right that they're looked at properly and the stories are appalling. ""People were treated absolutely appallingly. That's wrong. And we should do everything we can to make it right."" Mr Sunak said that, as chancellor, he approved the funding for the compensation to be paid to victims of the scandal.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-67912813,Concern at move to turn off Somerset CCTV cameras,The Police and Crime Commissioner for Somerset has said he is concerned turning off CCTV cameras in the county would put people's safety at risk.,2024-01-08,"The Police and Crime Commissioner for Somerset has said he is concerned turning off CCTV cameras in the county would put people's safety at risk. It is one of the proposals unveiled by Somerset Council to stop the local authority going effectively bankrupt. Council Leader Bill Revans said the cuts are ""heartbreaking"", but necessary to save £100m. Other measures could include raising council tax by 10 per cent, closing recycling centres and selling assets. Details set to be considered on 15 January show Somerset Council, which declared a ""financial emergency"" last year, is facing cost pressures of £108.5 million in 2024-25, an annual increase of 20 per cent. Speaking on BBC Radio Somerset, Liberal Democrat Mr Revans admitted stopping the council's CCTV service would make the county a less safe place to live. ""This is not something we would want to do,"" he said, but added that CCTV is a discretionary service that councils don't legally have to provide. Mark Shelford, Police and Crime Commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said he shared the concerns of residents, particularly those in retail and business, who are worried ""this will put their safety at risk"". ""So far I'm unaware of any formal consultation process with the police about the impact that switching off CCTV may have on crime prevention or from an operational perspective,"" he said. Mr Shelford saidhe is seeking assurance from Chief Constable Sarah Crew that she's working with the council to provide information and evidence to ensure a decision is made based on value and not just cost. Under the proposals, Somerset Council will also ask the government to be allowed to raise council tax by 10 per cent. The local authority needs special permission to do this, as it is twice the maximum rise usually allowed. On an average, Band D, property council tax would rise by £163.80 a year. This amount excludes projected rises for fire, police and any imposed by town or parish councils. ""I'm retired, my energy bills have astronomically risen in the last 12 months, we'll have to make economies,"" said south Somerset resident Colin Hyde. ""I'm reasonably well-off but I can see a lot of people are going to be desperately struggling if the council tax goes up by 10 per cent."" Somerset Council said its council tax is currently one of the lowest in the country and a ten per cent increase would bring the average bill just below the national average for UK councils. The proposals also involve closing tourist information centres in Taunton and at Cartgate on the A303. The Chief Executive of Visit Somerset John Turner said the move would be ""dreadfully sad"" as both centres are ""very, very busy"". John Allen from Falmouth, Cornwall, who had stopped to walk his dog at Cartgate said ""I've often popped in for information, sometimes just looking at the gifts they have. I'd miss it."" Under the proposals, five of the county's recycling centres could shut. Funding for highways maintenance for things like potholes and verges could be squeezed and money for council owned public toilets stopped entirely. Subsidies for bus services will be reviewed and so will support for the county's theatres. Somerset Council says it hopes that in all the areas where they decide to make cuts to discretionary services, other bodies, like parish or town councils, will step in to help run them instead. Increases in fees and charges for things like parking are also on the cards. To balance the books, the council also plans to spend almost £37m from its reserves. It also plans to ask the government if it can borrow money, or sell assets, to fund day-to-day running costs. The council also said in future years, it will need to reduce the authority's size and staffing so it can be financially sustainable. A public consultation is taking place ahead of the final council budget meeting on 20 February. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Raymond Poyner, 73, from Weston-super-Mare, groomed and sexually assaulted two boys in the 1970s and 1980s. The two men, now both in their 50s, said their memories of the abuse will stay with the forever. ""Since my childhood, what Poyner did to me sticks in my mind,"" said one of the victims. Avon and Somerset Police said Poyner worked as a residential social worker in the 1970s in Cornwall where he groomed and sexually assaulted a boy in his care at a children's care home. When informed by police that Poyner had pleaded guilty shortly before a trial was due to begin, the man who was abused broke down in tears. In a victim statement, prepared for the sentencing hearing, he said: ""It consumes a lot of my thinking and the way I view my life. ""I still have no trust in anyone, and even after all this time, I find it difficult to form relationships. I just cannot allow anyone to get close to me: I cannot take people into my confidence. ""Now Poyner has been sentenced there is some closure to this episode. Having said that, I don't think I will ever put behind me the thoughts of what Poyner put me through."" After moving from Cornwall to Axbridge in the 1980s, Poyner indecently assaulted a second boy. The man, who was abused approximately 40 years ago, says the abuse continues to affect his professional and personal lives, despite his wife's love and support. He said in a victim personal statement released by police: ""I have little trust in those in authority, this view is jaded by the fact Poyner was a social worker, a position of authority. ""I have always felt somewhat of an outsider, and found it difficult to form relationships."" He added that what Poyner did will ""stay with me for the rest of my life"". Sentencing judge, Recorder Jaron Crooknorth, stated Poyner was a predatory offender who abused a position of trust to groom young boys. Det Con Mike Tarling, who led the investigation, said: ""Raymond Poyner sexually abused two children the best part of 50 years ago but the impact of his crimes continues to be felt by those two men. ""Both have shown incredible strength and courage to report what happened. ""We urge anyone who have been abused to report what happened to us, no matter when it happened,"" he added. Poyner pleaded guilty in October to two counts of indecent assault, and in January 2021 admitted a third charge of possession of indecent photos of children and a video. He was sentenced at North Somerset Courthouse, due to Taunton Crown Court's unavailability, to a total of five years and one month in prison.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-67896341,Portsmouth World War Two veteran recalls HMS Barham attack,A Royal Navy veteran has described witnessing one of the worst tragedies of World War Two.,2024-01-08,"A Royal Navy veteran has described witnessing one of the worst tragedies of World War Two. The attack on HMS Barham by a German U-boat in November 1941 cost the lives of more than 860 British sailors. Len Chivers, 99, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, witnessed the sinking of the battleship from HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Mediterranean. He recalled that he went out on deck and saw ""an enormous pool of smoke"" before the vessel exploded. Remarkable footage of the blast was captured by a cameraman on another convoy vessel. Later, Mr Chivers was moved to the destroyer HMS Kipling where he was seriously wounded in a bomb explosion. He suffered severe burns and a fractured spine in the attack. Mr Chivers joined the Royal Navy aged 15 and carried out initial training on the Isle of Man, which he described as ""very thorough, very strict, at times harsh"". HMS Queen Elizabeth was his first ship, a battleship with a crew of 1,000 sailors, which he described as a ""very prestigious, awesome"" vessel. While on board, Mr Chivers helped with the evacuation of allied troops from Crete, as well as regular patrols and convoy work. Ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, in 2025, the BBC is trying to gather as many first-hand accounts from surviving veterans as possible, to preserve them for future generations. Working with a number of partners, including the Normandy Memorial Trust and the Royal British Legion, the BBC has already spoken to many men and women who served during the War - you can watch their testimonies here. Soon after the sinking of HMS Barham, HMS Queen Elizabeth was badly damaged while docked in Alexandria Harbour. Italian frogmen placed explosive charges under the ship, killing eight engine room staff. Mr Chivers was then transferred to HMS Kipling, which was hit by a bomb in May 1942. ""The bomb landed very, very close to our 4in gun. I had a steel helmet on, I presume it must have come off because if it had been on, I wouldn't have got the burn on my head,"" he said. ""In a very, very short time came complete oblivion, complete oblivion for me, I was completely unconscious."" He was pulled on board another destroyer, HMS Jarvis, and taken to a field hospital in Egypt, before being taken via a hospital ship to Durban in South Africa. ""I knew I had burns on my face and back, it hadn't set in that my spine was fractured. But it was a lot of pain for three weeks,"" Mr Chivers said. Eventually, he returned home and received pioneering plastic surgery at Rooksdown House in Basingstoke, from Sir Harold Gillies - who was born in New Zealand and initiated the speciality of plastic surgery in Britain following his experiences in World War One. After recovering, he was back out to sea serving at a naval air station in India, before returning to Basingstoke where skin was grafted from his chest, to his face. After the war, Mr Chivers continued to serve in the Royal Navy, eventually becoming an officer and retiring after 35 years of service in 1974. Reflecting on his time in service, he said: ""I count myself as one of the lucky ones."" Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Tracy Felstead, from Telford, was sentenced to six months in a young offenders institution in 2002. She was wrongly accused of stealing £11,503 while working at Camberwell Green Post Office in London. Ministers have been meeting to consider ways of clearing the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters. More than 700 branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on evidence from faulty software over 16 years - now described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history. Speaking to BBC News, Ms Felstead, who had her conviction quashed at the Court of Appeal in 2021, said accountability was needed. ""We were classed as criminals by the Post Office, now it's their turn to actually be investigated,"" she said. ""Somebody needs to be held accountable for everybody."" Ms Felstead said she was found guilty through just her signature on paperwork, but there was no actual evidence of theft. ""I wouldn't plead guilty to something I hadn't done,"" she said. Mr Bates vs the Post Office, an ITV drama about the scandal, has brought renewed media attention to the issue. The former sub-postmistress said there was a political will for a single act to overturn all the convictions but urged caution ""just in case you have that one person that has committed a crime"". She agreed the Post Office should be removed from the appeals process and its former chief executive, Paula Vennells, should be stripped of her CBE. ""In my eyes, she shouldn't have had it in the first place,"" Ms Felstead said. More than one million people have signed an online petition calling for Ms Vennells to lose the honour. Ms Vennells has been contacted for comment on the petition. Rubbina Shaheen, who worked at the Greenfields Post Office in Shrewsbury, was jailed for a year in 2010 after being wrongfully convicted of false accounting and theft. She and her husband, Mohamed, lost their home and were forced to live in a van. Mrs Shaheen always maintained her innocence and in April 2021, the Court of Appeal confirmed Mrs Shaheen was innocent and that the Post Office's computer system Horizon, that was to blame. Mr Shaheen said it was ""exciting"" the government is taking action following the TV drama. He said his wife has received some compensation, but they were still fighting for more. ""Any monies that has been paid up is not going to bring our lives back for what we have suffered,"" he said. But Mrs Shaheen said she has struggled to move on from what happened and the current interest is ""bringing bad memories all over again."" ""You try to get away with it and you try to live a normal life but at the end of the day it just stirs it up,"" she said. Mrs Shaheen said she still ""struggles"" with what happened ""every day"" and has sleepless nights. ""My mental health is not good,"" she said. As pressure mounts on the government to act Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, was due to meet the minister responsible for the Post Office, Kevin Hollinrake, on Monday. The Metropolitan Police is now investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. A public inquiry into the scandal is also ongoing.

Baroness Helen Newlove, whose husband Garry was killed in a 2007 gang attack in Warrington, Cheshire, said the country needed to go ""back to basics"". Her comments came after she was reappointed for a one-year term in the role in October. She said she would always advocate for people's legal rights. ""Constantly now we're hearing about knife crime. Are we becoming so desensitised?"" she said. ""Anti-social behaviour used to be just the young people in gangs, now we've got a lot of the older generation who are causing problems. ""I do think Britain's broken but I don't think it's just a government issue. I think it's a society problem. ""People are very angry. People treat people terribly so I think we have to go back to basics."" Mr Newlove, a 47-year-old salesman, was killed in front of his daughter when he confronted a gang of youths who had vandalised his wife's car in August 2007. Baroness Newlove, who previously served as commissioner between 2013 and 2019, has been dedicated to providing a voice to victims since his death. The position promotes the interests of victims and witnesses and regularly reviews the code of practice, which sets out the services victims can expect to receive. ""I was given this opportunity to help people, and I'll carry on doing that,"" she said. ""I'll challenge people and if I can help and educate young people and do that if they can just take one person, and it helps, I'll carry on doing that.""

Images of the unassuming landmark, located inside a phone box, were posted by locals who noticed the new offering in rural Herefordshire.Featured among its displays are top facts about Blunt, including that he used to be in the army but left because he didn't like it. Sharing the post, the musician said: ""Completely forgot to announce the opening of this fantastic cultural experience in glorious Herefordshire. Free entry for both my fans."" Other 'displays' in the museum in Urishay highlight Blunt's skills as a shadow puppeteer and his lack of connection to The Girl on the Train actress Emily Blunt. Karen Miller, owner of the nearby Nags Head pub in Peterchurch, told BBC Radio Hereford & Worcester she was aware the landmark had become the talk of the town. ""I knew it was on Facebook because somebody told me,"" Ms Miller said. But she showed less enthusiasm than Blunt himself, saying she wasn't particularly interested in going inside. ""I like his only song that I know 'you are beautiful' but no not really,"" she said when asked if she wanted to visit. ""I'll drive past it but that's as far as it goes."" Local woman Jedda, who works at Golden Valley Store and Post Office, added she too was not a big Blunt fan, but found his music fine to listen to. ""It's not very far, I might as well take a look,"" she added. Blunt was in the Army and left in 2002 to pursue a career in music. He scored a worldwide hit with You're Beautiful in 2005 before going on to sell more than 20 million albums.He has gained a cult following on his social media for witty comebacks and putdowns.

The Conservative-run authority also plans to use £13m from its reserves to help deliver a balanced budget, which is a legal requirement. The proposals, which are out for consultation, would see an increase in council tax of 4.99%, two-thirds of which is specifically for social care. The budget to be considered for final approval by the council on 13 February. The council serves a population of more that a million people and has a yearly budget of £1.1bn. Nearly half of that is spent on adult social care and just over a quarter on children's services. The proposed budget for 2024-25 includes an extra £31m investment to support those providing care, and increasing pay for care workers. The authority will also make £18m of additional investment available to ensure it continues to support looked-after children and children with disabilities, plus a £7m investment in the Making SEND Everyone's Business improvement programme - an extra £2m on last year. In November, its SEND [special educational needs and disabilities] service was given the lowest rating possible by inspectors. The authority has also announced plans to spend £80m on highways and transport, including the continuation of a two-year £7.9m revenue funding for highways network improvements, with a focus on clearing vegetation, cleaning road signs, litter clearance, drainage and footway patching. It wants to spend £19m of additional capital investment in highways maintenance over the next two years to fix and protect roads, plus £2.7m of capital investment to improve facilities and accessibility at Hertfordshire's fire stations. Conservative council leader Richard Roberts said: ""Despite years of prudent financial planning, increased demand for services and rising costs mean we now need to access our reserves and make significant savings to balance the budget and ensure we continue to maintain, improve and protect services. ""We'll continue to lobby government for additional funds, particularly in relation to supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities, where we continue to be significantly under-funded compared to other councils, but we'll also do everything we can to alleviate our tax burden on you by making ourselves as streamlined and efficient as possible.""

The business said the new location would allow it to serve food and hire an extra 20 kitchen staff. The old site was due to be demolished as part of the Centre South project. Plans to knock down the arcade and other buildings to create shops, flats and restaurants were approved in 2022, but they left no room for The Yard, which opened in 2017. Richard Easter, owner of The Yard's parent company LE Projects, said: ""We had struggled to find a suitable venue in the city centre that met our requirements, and we were worried we may have had to close permanently."" The venue holds coffee mornings and other get-togethers. Ian Harrabin, chairman of Historic Coventry Trust, said he contacted Mr Easter when he heard The Yard was looking for a new home, to suggest they use the former training restaurant site.

The hotel, on Beach Road, has applied to Cornwall Council’s planning department for the “habitat enhancement and retention of concrete structures, section of the post and wire fence on land to the west of hotel and the tarmac service access track and stone terracing to the south of the hotel and erection of a gated access”, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service.There were protests when the hotel’s owner built the unauthorised meeting rooms in front of the beach at Carbis Bay in time for the summit.It was attended by international leaders, including US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister (at the time) Boris Johnson, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel.Cornwall Council previously issued an enforcement notice ordering the hotel to remove the pods and meeting rooms – including huge solid concrete footings – and return the site to its original form. However, the hotel proposes to retain some of the constructed features on the site to ensure the beach is protected from possible falling rocks.A decision will be made either by Cornwall Council’s planning department or by committee on a future date.

Brighton i360 Ltd said the attraction had faced “huge challenges”, but paying the loan back to the council had “always been a top priority”. In 2014, the council agreed to lend £36.2m to Brighton i360 Ltd to fund the 531ft (162m) tower - money which came from the government's Public Works Loan Board.In December last year, Ms Sankey said the company had paid £250,000 towards that year's debt, but the annual total should have been £1.49m, with payments due each June and December.The i360 has repaid £5.8m. However, under its original repayment schedule, it had been due to pay almost £18m by September 2023. Ms Sankey said the lack of repayments was taking its toll on other council services.“Had the i360 company been able to make its annual repayments to the council, we would have millions of pounds more to spend on core services for our city,” she said. “Such as early years investment, supporting residents with the cost of living, improving the look, feel and cleanliness of Brighton and Hove and addressing the mental health challenges of our young people.“We’ve therefore asked the managers of the i360 to produce a realistic and deliverable business plan for making the repayments that are owed.” The i360 has seen a 16% drop in visitor attendance compared to pre-pandemic levels. Brighton i360 Ltd chair, Julia Barfield, said the attraction had also dealt with “rising inflation, bleak summer weather, the cost-of-living crisis and national train strikes”. “Paying the loan back to the council has always been a top priority for Brighton i360 and we are sorry we are unable to make December’s instalment to the council,” she said. “We remain committed to improving the business and are actively implementing numerous initiatives to drive increased revenue.” Follow BBC South East on Facebook, external, on X, external, and on Instagram, external.

More than 700 branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on faulty software. ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, starring Toby Jones, has sparked renewed debate over the scandal. Janet Skinner, from Hull, said the show had helped to shine a light on what she and many others had gone through. Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses based on ""flawed"" information from a computer system called Horizon. Described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history, dozens of convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2021, subsequently paving the way for others to be overturned. Ms Skinner, 52, was handed a nine-month sentence in 2007 over an alleged shortfall of £59,000 from her Post Office branch in Bransholme, Hull. She served three months in prison before being released with an electronic tag, but eventually had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in April 2021. Commenting on the ""emotional"" ITV drama, she said it depicted ""what we have had to actually go through for the past two decades"". ""I think people will get more understanding of what it is about,"" she said. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Skinner also called for the Post Office to be removed from any future decision making. ""They have too much power over convictions being overturned, or being referred to the courts,"" she said. ""Even with relation to compensation, they are the ones who are running the show."" Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster in Bridlington, was made bankrupt by the Post Office after a two-year legal battle. He said his life had been ruined, but hoped the ITV drama would help bring about change. ""We just need to keep walking forward,"" he said. Talking about the impact, he said he and his family had been ostracised by the local community. ""My children were bullied because their father had stolen pensions from little old ladies,"" he said. ""Even now, I won't go in a Post Office because of the way they treated us."" Ministers were meeting on Monday to consider ways of clearing the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters. Tory MP Sir David Davis said there was ""no real reason"" why they should not be able to submit a mass appeal. Speaking to the BBC, Sir David, MP for Haltemprice and Howden, said the drama had galvanised the response to the scandal. At present, all cases are considered individually, but Sir David said: ""All of the cases depend on one single lie. ""I see no real reason, no logical reason you can't have a mass case, mass appeal on that basis."" A public inquiry into the scandal is ongoing. A petition calling for the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells to lose her CBE over the scandal has received more than one million signatures.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jy9313575o,Council bankruptcy warning without government deal,N/A,2024-01-08,"Stoke-on-Trent City Council said it would have to cut “pretty much everything” it was not legally obliged to provide if it failed to agree a financial support deal with the government.The authority said discussions to date were “constructive and positive” but  without an agreement, its worst case scenario would be to declare effective bankruptcy.The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities was contacted by the BBC for a response.Under its budget proposals, the council said it would be forced to introduce year-round charges for brown bin collections, reduce staff numbers and stop some cultural grants. But even these cuts would leave the authority in a vulnerable state financially, it said in its plans.The council said it would be forced to issue a Section 114 notice - effectively declaring itself bankrupt - if a deal was not reached with the government and any additional cuts it made were ineffective in balancing its books. Council leader Jane Ashworth said: “If we don’t get a deal with the government, we will still be legally obliged to set a balanced budget.“This exercise will require further cuts and see many of our essential valued services diminish further.”She said failure to balance the books would result in the government stepping in to run the council, as it had done in places like Birmingham and Nottingham.This, she said, would lead to the closure of leisure centres and museums, as well as reductions in street cleaning, grass cutting and highway maintenance. “We don’t want any of that to happen: we want to save our services and save our city,” she said.Bosses at the council currently estimate a funding gap of about £14m for the 2024-25 financial year, which they said was directly linked to increasing costs in children’s social care.One in 56 of all children in Stoke-on-Trent were in the council's care, a total of 1,150 with 3,500 vulnerable adults also needing support, the authority said.As a proportion of its budget, the council said 59% of the total was forecast to be spent on social care services in 2023-24 - an increase from 48% of its budget in 2013-14 The council hoped an additional £44.7m from the government for this financial year and the next would cover the shortfall.It was also planning to increase council tax by 4.99% which it estimated would cost most people between 99p and £1.48 each week, depending which council tax band their house was in.“Like many local authorities, particularly those in deprived urban areas, we are down to the bare bones,"" the report on the budget proposals said.The council also said its reserves were at an “absolute minimum” and were below the level required for financial resilience.

A Kent Police spokesman said: ""On each occasion a lone offender has threatened victims, in order to steal cash and high value possessions, including jewellery and watches.""Victims have been threatened with a firearm and restrained with cable ties and ropes.""Detectives have said they are looking for a stocky or muscular white man of about 6ft (1.8m), with a south of England accent.Officers believe he may have military training, as he was able to use only one hand to restrain his victims with cable ties, even while they were struggling.During some robberies he was described by police as ""using unnecessary levels of violence"". He carries a sawn-off shotgun. Susan Morris suffered a broken jaw when the man attacked her while robbing her home in Kingswood, Surrey, in October 2017.She described how he  pointed a gun in her back, hit her head against a wall and dragged her across the floor by her hair while demanding she hand over more jewellery.The hunt for the man is being led by the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate.

Avon and Somerset Police are searching for Richard Scatchard, 70, after his partner Kelly Faiers was found dead at his Minehead home on 15 October. Officers have been unable to find him despite more than 80 sightings. The force have now referred themselves to the Independent Office of Police Conduct after a formal complaint made by Ms Faiers family over its response. The force previously said it would not be referring itself to the watchdog after an initial assessment of its response considered it not ""to be of misconduct level and/or requiring an IOPC referral"". Police said Scatchard, who is considered a risk to the public, specifically those he forms relationships with, disappeared the day after the suspected murder of Ms Faiers, 61, from Weston-super-Mare, who was found dead at his home. The force said Mr Scatchard is a regular user of dating apps and has previously been convicted of sexual offences in which he administered drugs to his victims to enable his crimes. Avon and Somerset Police did not tell the public that Scatchard was a convicted sex offender, when the force made an initial appeal over his disappearance. The force, who is being supported by the National Crime Agency, said it continues to conduct searches to find Scatchard, who is wanted on a prison recall and who they wish to speak to in connection with Ms Faiers death. ""We have made a number of public appeals and a Crimestoppers reward remains live for information that could lead to his arrest. We urge anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact us,"" it said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cl79xkngw9do,Prison 'failing to provide inmates with enough to do',N/A,2024-01-08,"Inspectors have linked a recent increase in violence and drug use at a Staffordshire prison to a failure to provide inmates with adequate opportunities for training and enrichment.HMP Dovegate near Uttoxeter had nevertheless seen improvements in other aspects, they found.The category B prison - inspected in September and October 2023, external - holds long-term and on-remand prisoners, and is privately operated by Serco.Serco said it was aware of the areas where improvement was needed and was working hard to address them. The most recent figures show HMP Dovegate has a population of 1,150 inmates.The current prison director took up his role in January 2023, and was the seventh postholder within a decade.This lack of stability, inspectors said, meant improvements had not happened as quickly as expected.This was particularly the case in the prison’s provision of education and other activities, according to inspectors – who graded it “poor” in that regard.They said it also meant the site was failing to fulfil its role as a training prison. They said this was particularly disappointing because education provision was run directly by Serco, meaning there were none of the issues with managing education contracts often found elsewhere.Inspectors found that while most of the long-term population was in work or education, many jobs were on the wings where prisoners were underemployed and spent much of their time without enough to do.Prison staff had, however, introduced several enrichment activities such as a film club or gardening, much of which was prisoner-led.Levels of violence at HMP Dovegate were lower than in comparable prisons, but there had been a recent increase in assaults by prisoners on other inmates, inspectors said.Staff were often reluctant to challenge low-level transgressions, inspectors added, such as vaping or improper dress. This meant rules were unclear. HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor said there was much for staff at HMP Dovegate to be proud of.He highlighted how well officers knew inmates despite low staffing levels.He commented: “The jail is performing better than most prisons with big remand populations and longer-term prisoners.“In the next year, the prison needs to completely re-orientate towards education, training, and work, making sure that prisoners have a greater sense of purpose and are better prepared to get work on release.”He added: “A more productive jail will also lead to a reduction in the high demand for drugs and its consequent violence.”He said he was confident progress would be made, provided the prison had a sustained period of more stable leadership.Andy Johnson, Serco prison director at HMP Dovegate, said he was pleased the prison was performing better than most of its type, adding: ""We are particularly proud of the key work that we undertake with prisoners and our therapeutic dog training programme.""However we fully recognise that there are areas where we need to improve, particularly in prisoner education, training and work and we will be working hard to address this.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-67910285,"Oxford flood alleviation scheme wait 'frustrating', MP says","An MP has said the wait for a flood alleviation scheme is ""frustrating"", after parts of a city were once again submerged after a storm.",2024-01-08,"An MP has said the wait for a flood alleviation scheme is ""frustrating"", after parts of a city were once again submerged after a storm. Roads, homes and cars are under water in Oxford following heavy rainfall. A public inquiry into the future of a £176m flood alleviation scheme in the city is currently under way. Anneliese Dodds, MP for Oxford East, said such projects needed to be accelerated for the sake of those residents who were repeatedly affected. A number of temporary flood barriers have been put up in the city, and some roads and paths have been closed following heavy rain on Thursday, in aftermath of Storm Henk. Oxford Direct Services is providing sandbags for houses in at-risk locations, as well as installing flood barriers and pumps in several areas. Abingdon Road was shut on Friday evening due to rising water levels, and did not reopen in time for Monday morning's rush hour. Seacourt Park & Ride is temporarily closed, and major bridge replacement works near Oxford Station have also been impacted. There are several flood warnings and alerts for Oxfordshire, though water levels are expected to fall over the course of the day. The fire service rescued a person stranded on a boat stuck in floodwater on Temple Island near Henley-on-Thames on Monday morning. Discussing the flood alleviation scheme, Ms Dodds said: ""We need to be really speeding up these kinds of projects, ultimately because they are so important for people right now who have had a very, very scary time, and a very difficult time."" One of the biggest flood schemes in the country, the project involves creating a new stream through the existing floodplain to the west of Oxford, diverting floodwater away from built-up areas. The Environment Agency (EA) has made a Compulsory Purchase Order to carry it out, though some campaigners have voiced concerns about the damage it would cause to the environment, and the cost of the project. Ms Dodds added: ""We've had the same pattern over and over and over again over the last few years, where you've had predicted heavy rainfall… and then [the government] forget about it until the next winter."" She called for regular taskforce meetings ""so that we're ready for the next time, rather than this last minute dot com approach"". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Oxford over the weekend, meeting EA staff and residents affected by the floods. He said the government had invested £5.2bn in flood defences. However, a report by the The National Audit Office in November said the number of extra homes to be protected from flooding in England has been cut by almost half, due to inflation having an impact on the amount of money invested. Oxford also experienced significant flooding in 2007, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Andrew Scott, head of waste treatment for Thames Water in the region, has apologised for sewage flowing into properties during the flooding, describing it as an ""awful thing to happen"". Mr Scott said: ""This was a perfect storm in that we had high intensity rainfall. Some areas had half a month's rain in just 24 hours. We had exceptionally high groundwater levels for this time of year. ""That combination has simply meant our sewer system has been hydraulically-overloaded, and that backs up eventually into people's houses."" Last year the company said it planned to reduce sewage floods into properties by 17%, and external sewer floods by 14%, as part of a ""record £4.7bn investment"". Ms Dodds said: ""[I've] respect for the local staff but I'm afraid overall I would be giving Thames Water a pretty low mark."" But she also said there had been an ""incredible effort"" from a ""small band of very committed people"" who were erecting defences and ""working around the clock"". The public inquiry for the alleviation scheme at the King's Centre, Osney Mead, Oxford, in which an independent inspector will hear the cases for and against it, is expected to last about five weeks. A decision on the CPO is expected mid-2024. If confirmed, the EA said it could move to implement it in late 2024. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Conservative Chris Skidmore formally quit as an MP for Kingswood, Bristol, over the government's energy plans. The seat was held by Labour until the 2010 general election. Members from the party, which has not announced its candidate, said they will be fighting hard to overturn a 11,000 Tory majority. The government announced the oil and gas bill in November, in a bid to draw a dividing line with Labour, which has said it will not issue new licences if it wins power. Ministers say the legislation, which will fix yearly North Sea fossil fuel licensing in law, will help improve the UK's energy security. But in his resignation statement Mr Skidmore said: ""We can not expect other countries to phase out their fossil fuels when at the same time we continue to issue new licences or to open new oil fields. ""It is a tragedy that the UK has been allowed to lose its climate leadership, at a time when our businesses, industries, universities and civil society organisations are providing first-class leadership and expertise to so many across the world."" The formal resignation was handed in by Mr Skidmore on Monday. The Bristol Labour Party, which has begun canvassing in Kingswood, said: ""The Tory majority in Kingswood is more than 11,000 so this will not be easy but we will be giving the campaign everything we have got."" Commenting on Mr Skidmore's resignation, Jeremy Hunt has said he disagrees with his reasoning. The Conservative chancellor said: ""It is very sad to lose a respected colleague like Chris Skidmore. ""But I do profoundly disagree with the reasons that he gave for resigning."" One Kingswood resident, who wanted to be remain anonymous, said: ""It's a bit of a shock. ""I think it's sad but I admire him for standing down for his beliefs though. I'm afraid I don't know who I will vote for in the by-election."" Another said they were ""very disappointed"" Mr Skidmore had quit. ""I think he's been quite good around here,"" she said. ""I think people should know well in advance who the candidates should be. ""I will vote in both the by-election and the general election."" Mr Skidmore had already announced he would not stand as an MP at the next election. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said it was an ""embarrassing mess for Rishi Sunak,"" showing voters ""simply don't trust the Conservatives on the environment"". Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said it left the government's green credentials ""in tatters"". All parties are yet to announce candidates for the position. A date for the by-election to replace Mr Skidmore will be fixed at a future date. The BBC has contacted the Conservative Party for comment. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-derbyshire-67872308,Daredevil twins 'loving every minute' of Derby charity swims,Two medal-winning twins have joined exclusive water park sessions in Derby.,2024-01-08,"Two medal-winning twins have joined exclusive water park sessions in Derby. Emilia and Katie, aged 10, have been taking part at Moorways Sports Village and Water Park in Derby. The swims are organised by Derby-based charity me&dee, which gifts families with special memories when they are needed most. Emilia and Katie won a haul of 17 medals in the 2023 World Dwarf Games in Germany, excelling in football, basketball, javelin and swimming. Now the sporty pair have been joining the water park events with other disabled children. ""The girls are loving every minute of the sessions"", said their mother Jenny. ""me&dee sessions were a brilliant way for the daredevil duo to enjoy themselves, which they could not do in ordinary swimming sessions."" Emilia and Katie were diagnosed with achondroplasia, the most common type of dwarfism after birth. They were born eight weeks early, after being delivered by their father at home on the bathroom floor in Loughborough. Due to their height, the girls are often unable to go on slides in ordinary sessions at other leisure centres and water parks. ""They're very good swimmers, but water park height restrictions are 1.2 metres, and they're 1.15 metres tall"", said Jenny. ""They also feel self-conscious in their swimming costumes because it accentuates their short limbs, but when they're with me&dee, they don't mind. ""That's the problem with dwarfism, because they often can't do something that their friends can do just because of their size"", the mother of three added. Emilia said the sessions made the children feel ""the same as everyone else"". ""The sessions have been really nice for me because there are the slides that we usually wouldn't be allowed to go on. It just feels like we're not different and it feels as if we're a part of everyone and the same as everyone else,"" she added. Katie said: ""I like that you can do the sessions with other people who have disabilities, because they can enjoy it as much as we can, and that's what makes me happy about doing the sessions."" Founder of the charity, Maria Hanson MBE, said: ""Watching these children splash away in the water, go down the slides, free from any embarrassment or stress, while their parents get to watch them, is probably one of the most moving experiences we have seen in me&dee's 17-year history"".

The southbound stretch of Eastern Road in Portsmouth is expected to be shut until Tuesday afternoon. The road is a major route into the city, and has been closed several times recently due to similar issues that required fixing by Southern Water. Southern Water said the sewer burst on Wednesday and it was working with the city council on a long-term solution. Commuters told BBC Radio Solent that the traffic was an ""absolute nightmare"", with one adding: ""All the roads into Portsmouth have been blocked up - there's traffic everywhere."" Another said: ""It just seems to be one leak after another, they don't seem to be fixing it properly."" Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, cabinet member for transport at Portsmouth City Council, told BBC Radio Solent: ""It's really disappointing that it looks as if lack of investment over many years by Southern Water means that the sewers are not fit for purpose, and that they are bursting - causing real problems for local people."" He added that it looked as if there was a ""very long-term problem"" with the sewage system around Eastern Road. Portsmouth sits on an island, with only three routes for traffic to go in and out of the city. Mr Vernon-Jackson said this meant ""when you shut one of them, it causes traffic chaos"". Southern Water said: ""Our teams are on site and tankers have been deployed to assist with removing excess water and to avoid flooding"". The company warned people travelling to Portsmouth to plan their journey and allow extra time. ""We are working with Portsmouth City Council to address the need for further future emergency repairs along the length of the sewer main with a long-term solution,"" the company added.

Lincolnshire Police shared images on Saturday showing a car partially submerged at Dunham Bridge, which spans the River Trent. The bridge remained closed on Monday. Officers said the driver, who was not injured, ""thought they knew better"". Lincolnshire's fire chief Mark Baxter said: ""I recognise it's frustrating, but closures are there for a reason."" On Monday, Mr Baxter, who is also chair of the resilience forum, said the county had seen ""unprecedented"" flooding. Confirming the A57 at Dunham Bridge was still closed, with diversions in place, he said: ""We are continually monitoring the situation and we will reopen [the road] as soon as levels drop. ""Flood water is slowly receding."" Mr Baxter said it was vital road closures were adhered to, adding flood waters contained ""visible and hidden hazards"". Ignoring notices ""puts yourself and emergency responders at risk"", he said. ""It's just not worth the risk."" Mr Baxter said it was an ""improving picture"" across the county but warned: ""We're not out of the woods yet."" Meanwhile, Mr Baxter confirmed investigations would be carried out into why part of Torksey Lock Caravan Park near Lincoln flooded. Some residents were forced to evacuate on Friday. Mr Baxter said it was still ""too early"" to comment about possible causes of that flooding, but added: ""What I will say is that water levels were the highest on record."" Fraser Turner, the park's manager, previously told of the upset caused by the flooding. Asked about claims circulating on social media that the caravan park had flooded due to concentrated efforts to protect the lock, Mr Baxter said: ""We need to understand once the water levels have receded exactly why some areas flooded and why areas didn't."" At Torksey, River Trent levels peaked at 24ft 4in (7.42m) on Sunday, official data showed. The previous highest level recorded was 23ft 9in (7.31m) in November 2000. On Monday morning, the level had dropped to 22ft 1in (6.75m), Mr Baxter confirmed. Two flood warnings remain for Lincolnshire, at Heighington Beck and the River Witham from Washingborough to Metheringham. Mr Baxter said ""quite a lot of water"" remained at locations including Greatford near Stamford, Heighington near Lincoln, and Tallington near Bourne. At Tallington, the Environment Agency (EA) was expected to take over pumping from firefighters on Monday, he said. Mr Baxter said the resilience forum was not predicting further river breaches but officials were continuing to ""closely monitor"" levels. He said: ""Breaches can happen at various places, at relatively short notice, so the EA has enhanced monitoring across all of our main riverways. ""It still has teams out, physically inspecting and checking all of the river banks where we have seen significant amounts of rainfall.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-67896799,Kent County Council plans 5% tax rise and service cuts,Kent County Council (KCC) is planning to raise council tax by 5% and cut services.,2024-01-08,"Kent County Council (KCC) is planning to raise council tax by 5% and cut services. Its draft budget began its passage through the authority's committees with environment, transport and cabinet meetings on 3 January. KCC proposes charging for some special educational needs school transport, a review of household waste sites and cuts to the community warden scheme. The budget is due to be set on 19 February. A 5% increase is the maximum an authority can raise council tax without a local referendum, with 2% of that money being ringfenced for adult social care. The planned increase would raise the amount a Band D property pays by nearly £50 a year, from £1,534 to £1,580. In December local councils across England found out how much they would be getting from central government for the financial year 2024-25. Kent's budget report outlines it will receive £5.4m less than officers had expected, raising its funding gap for the next financial year to £54.2m. KCC said it expected to be able to set a balanced budget in February, avoiding the risk of declaring a Section 114 notice as several authorities around the country have done, effectively declaring bankruptcy. The budget includes several proposals to save money: In 2023 a proposal to close several household waste sites was defeated by a rebellion of backbench Conservative councillors. In November the cabinet agreed to introduce a government-led scheme to bring essential services under one umbrella called Family Hubs, saving about £900,000. This would see the end of KCC subsidies for youth clubs and activities commissioned by the council but run by outside organisations, but will, the authority claimed, bring bring £11m of ""transformational funding"" over three years. In his new year message, council leader Roger Gough warned 2024 would be ""extremely tough"", but said KCC had made ""sound decisions"" so far.

Developers Pannatoni told the BBC they also hope to begin construction of new business facilities by the end of 2024. The £700m redevelopment of the South Marston site will include 11 buildings which can be used as manufacturing sites or warehouses. Panattoni's development director James Watson said it will create 7,000 jobs at its peak. He said: ""Honda employed 5,000 people. As well as the jobs created, there will be 5,000 additional spin-off jobs created."" ""The development will add a value of £295m each year, or £1.2bn over the first decade to the local economy,"" he added. The Honda car plant closed in 2021 having made 3.7m cars during its 36 years in the town. The factory and surrounding former airfield was later bought in early 2022 by developer Panattoni, which also built the town's Amazon fulfilment centre and specialises in high-end distribution centres. The formal decision notice to approve the creation of an industrial park on the site was issued in December 2023, 22 months after the application was first put in. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, it means the final agreements are now all signed off between developers Panattoni and Swindon Borough Council on conditions and especially contributions made by the developer to improve infrastructure and facilities on and near the site and elsewhere in Swindon. The purchase is due to be completed in February - with Panattoni intending to start work within days of that happening.It is said around £7.5m will be spent on improvements to the immediate area and the borough as a whole, including 50 sites, to offset the damage redeveloping the former airfield will do to the local ecology. Although no tenants have been announced, Panattoni is already marketing the site, which it calls Panattoni Park. Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Jessica Daley drove from Middlesbrough to Leicester to star as Eva Peron in Evita on Saturday after the original actor and understudy both fell ill. She was left ""genuinely shaking"" following the call - which came shortly after she stepped out of the bath. Original lyricist Sir Tim Rice said he intended to thank Ms Daley and hoped to take in the show. Ms Daley said she was at her family home during a break in another touring production and was sorting out clothes when she got the call shortly before 12:00 GMT. ""My initial reaction was shock,"" she said. ""I was shaking, I was genuinely shaking. ""I was thinking 'Can I do this? What is going on?' ""Then you just go into a state of, not panic, but shock and feeling overwhelmed and 'what do I need to do?' and 'action stations'. ""I was staying at my mom's house and I wanted to tell her but she had taken the dog out and left her phone at home. ""So I waited for her to come back and I said 'I'm going. I'm going.' ""So it was a bit chaotic and I leapt into action and the suitcase which is kind of half-full from the tour had everything thrown back into it so I shut it, put it in my car and hit the road."" Ms Daley travelled the 150 miles to Leicester's Curve theatre, arriving at about 16:00. ""I walked straight into the building, straight onto stage, straight into rehearsals, singing through the score which I hadn't sung for four years,"" she said. ""So we just hit the ground running."" With such limited time and dealing with a different production of the musical, Ms Daley sang some of her part from the side of the stage. ""This production was completely different to the production I did,"" she said. ""It is much more modern and has been re-invented. ""I had to be able to jump back in with the same character in a day and a very different set-up. ""It was just crazy but the cast and everybody was so accommodating and friendly and went with me, and it's a credit to the company that they accepted me."" Chris Stafford, Curve's chief executive, said: ""Watching Jess was absolutely sublime. ""She was a superstar. She wasn't just standing at the side singing it, which would be more than enough. She acted it, she was interacting, she was on stage performing the role of Eva. ""I felt really proud of Jess and also the phenomenal Evita company who really wrapped around her and made sure she was really safe and secure in our stage."" Ms Daley received a standing ovation for her performance and is on standby for Tuesday's show in case of any further problems. She has also performed in stage versions of Billy Elliot, An Officer and a Gentleman, and The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Lord Lloyd-Webber and Sir Tim Rice wrote the musical about the life of Argentine political leader Eva Peron in 1978. It was turned into a film in 1996 with Madonna in the title role.

He was one of a number of officers supporting West Midlands Police ahead of the match, which Aston Villa won 2-1. PC Forbes had been clearing bricks, bottles, and debris where officers were positioned when he was first hit by a traffic sign. “Within a minute or so of that, a flare came in and landed on me,” said PC Forbes, a police officer for 18 years. “At that stage, I was aware of a bright pink intense light around my upper chest.""PC Forbes said he had begun patting his chest in a bid to extinguish the flames. “I remember it as a Roman candle effect and these little orange flickers coming off it. I was going off like a crackerjack.“It was getting brighter and more intense.""Colleagues joined him in trying to extinguish the flames before he rolled on the floor to put them out. ""The relief and the adrenalin dump I got was unbelievable,"" PC Forbes said. PC Forbes, who is part of the safer neighbourhood team covering Wyre Forest, and is based in Kidderminster, spent the night at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where he was treated for minor burns and smoke and heat inhalation.“It’s nothing lasting, for which I’m eternally grateful for,” he said. West Mercia Police Federation chair Barry Horton added it had offered support to those policing that evening. “The violence that officers faced that night was unacceptable,"" he said. “At the end of the day, they’re men and women, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, and they shouldn’t have to face violence or the threat of violence just for doing their jobs."" Doran Urbaniak, 40, of Tudor Road, Leicester: Marchin Staniec, 30, and Bartlomiej Szmytke, 21, have each pleaded not guilty to a charge of violent disorder over the incident and were released on conditional bail ahead of a hearing in March 2025.Forty-six men were arrested after the disorder, with criminal charges against 39 of the Polish fans subsequently dropped.Charges against seven men were being proceeded with, the Crown Prosecution Service said.

Hilary Fleming, a retired NHS podiatrist from Swindon, said the Wiltshire Air Ambulance helped her husband, Shaun, following both falls. Ms Fleming will don her 1,095th hat later, which she wears while exercising. ""I'm addicted now,"" she said. Ms Fleming came home from work one day in 2013 to her neighbour saying her husband had a fall from a ladder. ""He'd broken his neck and his back. The air ambulance came and held him until he was stabilised,"" she said. Mr Fleming was flown by air ambulance to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol and he had to undergo an eight-hour operation at the Royal United Hospital in Bath. ""A year later he decided to chop down some trees in the garden. He fell off the [shed] roof and that time broke both his shoulder blades, his hip and his skull,"" Ms Fleming said. Again the air ambulance was called to help. Mr Fleming made a full recovery following both incidents and has run two marathons, also raising money for the air ambulance charity. Ms Fleming said her own fundraising idea came about when she decided to go walking every day during lockdown in 2021. To motivate herself, she wore a different hat every day for the year. ""I wanted to see how long I could go wearing a different hat each time,"" Ms Fleming said. ""Walking is quite boring sometimes, so [in 2022] I came up with 'hat-ercise' [exercising in a hat]. ""We all need a laugh, and so far my antics have only been greeted with smiles."" Ms Fleming has been undertaking 30 minutes of exercise each day, showcasing a different style hat. She has taken part in bodyboarding, cycles, swims and yoga in a range of locations around the UK and in Canada. She gives away a lot of the hats she wore to charity, but over the years said she has collected six large boxes of them at home. A spokesperson for Wiltshire Air Ambulance said: ""The fundraising Hilary has undertaken for our charity in the last three years has been so inspiring. ""Borne out of an idea to get moving during the pandemic, Hilary has gone on to raise over £3,200 and, when you factor in her many hours volunteering for our charity too, she has effectively paid for an entire lifesaving mission on her own.""

Emma Skinner, 42, of St Helens also stole a signet ring belonging to the victim's father, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. She took the rings in February 2022 while the victim was grieving the sudden death of his wife of 59 years. Skinner, who pleaded guilty, was jailed for 18 months at Liverpool Crown Court. The CPS said Skinner went into the victim's room during her shift at a care home in Maghull and thought he was asleep. Skinner took the opportunity to take both rings from his hands, the CPS added. However, the victim, who died nine months later, was not asleep and reported the rings were missing. Skinner, of Thackray Road, had already sold the rings at a nearby pawnbrokers for £165 when she was arrested, the CPS said. In a victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing, the man's daughter said he had been ""inconsolable"" following the theft four days after his wife died. She said she had never seen her father remove his wedding ring. ""It was the same with his father's signet ring which was all he had from his father. ""These two rings meant everything to him and at the time of her death, his wedding ring was the only tangible item dad had left to remind him of my mum."" She said she was ""utterly horrified anybody could commit such a callous act towards a vulnerable man, particularly so soon after the loss of his wife"". ""The fact the person responsible for this theft had actually assisted us in searching for the rings and knowing now that she had stolen them, made me feel sick to my stomach."" ""I feel I have not yet grieved properly for either my mum or my dad, who sadly passed away himself just nine months later."" Jane Stacey, of the CPS, said Skinner had taken advantage of ""the vulnerability of a person she was supposed to be caring for and left him traumatised"". ""She pawned the rings and they have never been recovered,"" she added. Det Insp Jay Halpin said: ""Targeting vulnerable people and stealing from them while in a trusted position is the lowest of the low.

Parents are finding it hard to get nursery places and report quitting full-time work to care for their children. Nurseries are closing faster than new ones are opening and educators say staff are leaving for better paid jobs in supermarkets. The BBC has been speaking to those hit by a system which some say is not ""fit for purpose"". ""I feel really worthless... I just did not think it was going to be this difficult to get a nursery place."" Charlotte left her full-time job in IT to look after her and her partner's 18-month-old daughter. When she picked up part-time work, she said it left her with £5 a day. After childcare costs, the couple were going into their savings by hundreds of pounds every month. ""Being out of work, not by choice, when you have worked and provided, it is really horrible. That is the bit that has affected me the most mentally,"" Charlotte said. ""It is not the example I want to set for my child either, because growing up my parents worked. ""I feel very lucky that I have this time with my daughter because I will not be able to get it back, but this was not the plan,"" she added. Where the family live in Thornbury, near Bristol, there are two nurseries, but neither are able to offer a place as they are so in demand. Outside the town, there are nurseries in Alvestone and Charfield, which Charlotte would have to take a bus to as she does not own a car. The latter only has one bus running to it every two hours from where she lives, which is ""obviously not doable"", she said. ""I do not know what anyone can do, it feels like it is so broken in terms of childcare provision in this area. ""It is not like they can just open another nursery and it will be fixed because you have to find the staff. There is no incentive for people to work in a nursery, and I do not blame them,"" Charlotte said. The average cost of full-time nursery - 50 hours a week - for a child under two in Bristol is approximately £288 a week, according to charity Coram. Equivalent care from a childminder is slightly cheaper, at nearly £13,000 for the year. The UK is the third most expensive place for childcare among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), behind Switzerland and New Zealand. The OECD figures are based on a family with two children, aged two and three, who attend nursery for at least 40 hours a week, and take into account available state support. Across the west of England, the number of early years providers dropped by 695 to 2,817 between August 2019 and August 2023, according to education watchdog Ofsted. In the same period, nursery places declined by 974. Rachael, who lives in Keynsham in Somerset, said her newborn was automatically put on a waiting list for a nursery place which was initially intended for another of her children, before she had a miscarriage. She said without these circumstances, either her or her partner would have had to quit their jobs. ""We realise we are lucky in the end to even have a place, but it is not OK that to get to where we have done, we had to share so much so early with the nursery manager. ""People say parents should be empowered to choose whether to stay at home or to keep working once they have children - but with the current childcare situation that choice is becoming an illusion,"" Rachael said. Nathalie, from Peasedown St John in Somerset, said she is worried her family is in a ""never-ending cycle of debt"" because of childcare costs. The 33-year-old and her husband are struggling with the upfront costs of putting their son in nursery while they both work. ""If you don't have savings, it is basically impossible to do,"" she said. The Department for Work and Pensions said, because the couple both work, this disqualified them from receiving advance childcare payments. Nathalie, who receives universal credit, said the family's childcare costs are £600 a month and they fund that with credit cards and by deferring their rent. ""Going to work is a much better option than staying at home, but it will be at a cost. ""Even though there is a lot of support in place, it can be very difficult when there are upfront costs to consider,"" she added. At the moment, working parents of three and four-year-olds in England are eligible for 30 hours of free childcare per week during term time. In the spring budget of 2023, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said this scheme would be extended to cover younger children on a phased basis. From April, working parents of two-year-olds will get 15 hours of free childcare per week during term time, with children from nine months included from September. Applications for the funded childcare scheme opened on 2 January and its expansion should have fully rolled out by September 2025. Conservative MP for Stroud Siobhan Baillie is leading a cohort of backbench MPs lobbying the government to cut the cost of early years care. She said: ""It was always madness in my view that families had to wait until a child was three before free childcare came in, so nine months makes more sense. ""However, the early years workforce needs a massive boost for the expansion to happen so that is my focus now. These people are skilled and caring and need to be valued more. ""Looking after children is hard graft and a big responsibility. I go to work for a rest. Long term, I want to see more childcare choice for parents,"" she added. Sam Williams is headteacher of Redcliffe Nursery School and Children's Centre in Bristol. He praised the childcare workforce but said the government's support package was a ""little bit like a sticking plaster"". ""The increase in the funding rates are welcome and they will make a difference. But it does not address the long term, systematic underfunding of the sector,"" he said. ""It does not really identify a strong long-term vision with the resources required to achieve that,"" he added. Mr Williams said some people in the sector had been forced to leave, partly due to the cost of living crisis, to other public services like the NHS, or to work in retail or hospitality, which can pay a higher wage. ""You do earn more money going to work in a supermarket. It is often better paid than working in the early years. ""It is an incredibly emotionally demanding, intellectually challenging role. The importance of it, not to discredit other professions, is absolutely essential to the children and families now, but also the whole future of our society,"" he said. Joeli Brearley, founder of charity Pregnant Then Screwed, said parents were experiencing a ""cost of working crisis"". ""The cost of childcare is now so prohibitive that many families who use it are paying to go to work. ""Parents wait anxiously for the government's promised reduction in childcare costs starting in April, but unless we have enough providers willing to offer this discount, the promise will not come to fruition for the majority of families. ""Meanwhile, it is likely the quality of our childcare will deteriorate significantly as nursery staff are expected to care for more children and cut costs - the impact on our children could be catastrophic."" The Department for Education said it was ""delivering the single biggest investment in childcare in England's history"". A spokesperson added: ""To support the early years workforce, we are launching a new national recruitment campaign in the new year and are looking to introduce a new accelerated apprenticeship route into the sector to help recruit new staff. ""We are also investing hundreds of millions of pounds to increase rates paid for government-funded hours, which can be used to support staff salaries, and are providing a package of training, qualifications, and expert guidance worth up to £180m.""

A white Ford Focus hit a shop and a black BMW 1 Series hit a man and teenage girl in Village Road, Gosport, Hampshire, on Saturday at 23:00 GMT. Before the crash it was reported a man was forced into a white vehicle, being pursued by a black car, in Ferrol Road. Officers believe the reported kidnapping and crashes are linked. Police said those in the Ford Focus, believed to be two teenage boys, got out of the car and ran in the direction of Western Way. The pedestrians, a man in his 50s and a 16-year-old girl, who were struck by the BMW were both taken to hospital for treatment. Police said they were not in a life-threatening condition.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cumbria-67894540,Cumbria: Rise in special educational needs puts pressure on councils,Councils are facing multimillion-pound deficits after a steep rise in the number of pupils needing extra educational support.,2024-01-08,"Councils are facing multimillion-pound deficits after a steep rise in the number of pupils needing extra educational support. Local authorities in Cumbria said the number of children and young people assigned a document setting out special educational needs has increased by more than 50%. Councillors have called for extra funding from government. The Department for Education said they were ""supporting local authorities"". The number of children and young people in Cumbria with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) rose from 2,929 to 4,456 in the five years to March 2023, according to council papers. Cristina Bowman, who lives near Penrith, has two sons with EHCPs. ""If you get those children at an early age and educate them in the way that they need to be educated, in adulthood they're going to be able to support themselves a lot better,"" she said. The government gives local authorities grants to fund schools, including money to support pupils with additional needs. But the cost of provision in Cumbria is greater than the amount councils currently receive from government, meaning Cumberland Council and Westmorland and Furness Council each expect to have a deficit of more than £14m by April this year. Elaine Lynch, the Labour executive member for life-long learning and development at Cumberland Council, said the government should ""look at providing more funding"". Dr William Burns, from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said three-quarters of councils in England were dealing with deficits of this kind. ""Local authorities and schools are getting better at identifying children with complex needs - so it's a good thing, in one regard,"" he explained. ""However, with this perfect storm of rising costs, inflation and increasing demand, that's pushing these deficits up."" Councils have to set a balanced revenue budget, but can register a ring-fenced deficit against school grants until 2026. Mr Burns warned if councils are forced to pay off the overspend from their general funds, it could push well-performing authorities ""to the brink of effective bankruptcy"". A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Councils are responsible for providing the right support for children in their areas, but we know there is more to do - which is why we are urgently delivering against our plans published earlier this year to create a fairer special educational needs and alternative provision system.""

Eight fire engines could be removed, as well as the reduction of the number of on-call firefighters based at stations which would lose the fire engines. Last month the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) condemned proposals, saying they were ""a serious threat to public and firefighter safety"". The fire service said money saved would be reinvested to improve staff levels. Andrew Scattergood, from the FBU, said it was opposing the plans, adding services across the two counties had already been ""cut to the bone"". ""The reality is that removing eight fire engines from the residents of Hereford and Worcester is nothing else but cuts."" But chief fire officer Jon Pryce said only fire engines which were not used very often in stations, where there can be a shortage of on-call firefighters, would be lost. All the money saved would be used to increase staffing levels at the busiest fire stations, he added. If approved, the plans would mean ""more firefighters on the busiest first fire engines, and better availability of our remaining on-call fire engines"", Mr Pryce said. Speaking to BBC Hereford and Worcester, he added: ""It is not cuts, this is change. ""It is our choice as to whether we redirect the resources from these eight fire engines that are not very busy and not very available and whether we can use that money in a better way.

Ruth Pitter, who has worked on about 1,000 community projects in Bristol, said she was ""shocked"" by the honour. ""It's not something you think you're ever going to receive,"" she said. Valda Jackson, who designed a Windrush-themed 50p coin, said she was ""incredibly humbled"" by the ""inspiring"" achievement. The women's parents arrived in the UK after people were invited to leave their homes in the Caribbean to work in Britain. ""It's a long way from where my parents were when they arrived in Bristol with just their suitcases and nothing else,"" Ms Pitter said of being awarded the MBE. ""We have had such interesting journeys I guess."" Ms Pitter said her family were ""really proud"" and see it as an award for them too. She said she felt ""absolutely bowled over, humbled and privileged"" at being appointed an MBE for her services to equality, to charity and to the community in Bristol. Amongst her many achievements, Ms Pitter led on setting up the Commission on Race Equality in the city and provided victim support for many years at Crown Court. ""I've been really privileged to work in the mostly charitable sector in Bristol for nearly 40 years,"" she said. Ms Pitter estimates she has worked on about 1,000 projects, including helping groups set up and with funding, governance, equality and diversity. Last year, Ms Jackson designed a 50p coin to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush. The sculptor was born in St Thomas, Jamaica and moved to England in 1964.

Swindon Borough Council refused the proposal to convert the former Cobra Leathers clothing shop on Whitehouse Road into a hot food takeaway. Residents also raised concerns over parking and that rubbish disposal may attract ""unwanted pests"". Developer Shahab Deen said the plans would ""support the ongoing economic viability of the area"". He added: ""The business would create two full-time jobs. The proposals would increase footfall within this area and support the mixed uses without detriment to neighbouring uses."" According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) the tailoring shop has been closed since 2021. Residents said there was already not enough parking in the area and said they would install barriers outside their shop to prevent unauthorised use. One resident added: ""Any cars visiting yet another takeaway will add to this chaos and become extremely dangerous. ""The alley at the back of our property [on Whitehouse Road] is frequented by drug users for supply and use, also people drinking. ""We are worried people will gather in the alley and make noise and leave rubbish, adding to a problem that we have no control over."" Mr Deen said: ""There is unrestricted on-street parking in the surrounding streets which would allow for safe parking for customers collecting orders."" Nevertheless, council planners did not agree. The refusal report said: ""The application does not include proposals for kitchen ventilation and control of odours, which have the potential to impact on the character of the area, as well as upon neighbouring amenities in terms of noise and odour. ""As such the applications fails to address impacts upon neighbouring uses and amenities and the character of the area.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-67885844,Izzy Judd: 'Music let my brother in a coma connect with us',Rupert Johnston had been in a coma for two months after a horrific car crash in February 1997 and was showing no signs of brain activity.,2024-01-08,"Rupert Johnston had been in a coma for two months after a horrific car crash in February 1997 and was showing no signs of brain activity. Doctors advised turning off the 18-year-old musician's life support machine. But his father brought his son's beloved French horn to his bedside. Rupert, who grew up in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, began slowly moving his fingers along the valves in time to a Mozart recording. ""That was our first moment of hope that there was something there,"" recalls his younger sister, violinist Izzy Judd, who was 12 at the time. Rupert's skull needed to be rebuilt. He had 13 hours of brain surgery, where they removed his front left lobe, with his right lobe left in place but permanently damaged. ""The muscles around his lips, which he used to play the horn, were the only part of his face that wasn't severely damaged,"" Izzy says. Rupert was studying at the Guildhall School of Music at the time of the accident, having left home at the age of eight to become a chorister at King's College, Cambridge. He and Izzy, and their two brothers, grew up surrounded by music. Their parents ran a music school in Hertfordshire. ""Rupert was an exceptionally gifted musician and he was so charismatic, full of life and vibrant,"" Izzy recalls. ""His ambition was to be a professional horn musician and I have no doubt he would have achieved that."" Rupert gradually began to physically recover and he was discharged from hospital. But the family soon realised he would always need 24-hour care. The now 45-year-old has problems with his memory and spatial awareness. He has no inhibitions and needs help doing basic tasks like washing and laundry, Izzy says. It feels like there is always someone missing, Izzy says, even though he is still here and the family is ""still grieving the loss of who he might have been"". Yet Rupert can still play his French horn to an exceptional standard, which Izzy describes as ""a miracle"". ""As a child he had this extraordinary gift, and that still lives on. If there was going to be anything that would allow him to connect with us, it would be music. It is in his bones, it pours out of him and it has ever since he was a little boy."" Rupert has spent the last 21 years living in a home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, run by Brainkind - a charity that cares for people with acquired brain injuries. He regularly performs with the Aylesbury concert band and still has the same brilliant technical ability, Izzy says. ""He can sometimes be disruptive during rehearsals, but they are so accepting of him and he is a really valued member of the group. ""When he plays there is such familiarity, so you can slip into a bit of normality for a moment and you almost forget what has happened."" Izzy went on to study at The Royal Academy of Music in London. She and her other two brothers became professional musicians. Izzy joined the electric string quartet Escala, who found fame in 2008 on Britain's Got Talent. She performed in the strings section for the band McFly on tour and began dating their drummer, Harry Judd. ""Harry has always been phenomenal with Rupert and that was one of the reasons I knew I wanted to marry him. Harry did not know Rupert before the accident so he takes him for who he is,"" she says. On their wedding day, Rupert performed a horn solo from John Williams's Somewhere in My Memory, which features in the film Home Alone. ""People were in awe. It takes your breath away when Rupert performs. I felt unbelievably proud, but also sad because he was on the path to such a huge career and he's not likely to have his own wedding day."" Izzy and Harry went on to have three children, which Izzy says triggered a lot of emotions about her brother. ""Rupert is very sweet with them and they are very close. My son Kit reminds me of Rupert as a young boy. He has the same zest for life and he pushes boundaries. It makes me think about the life that Rupert could be living."" Izzy did not pick up her violin for some time after having children and says she was ""a bit lost in early motherhood"". ""We struggled to start a family and then after I had Lola, Kit came along quickly and unexpectedly and life became a bit chaotic. ""When I had my youngest Lockie, I played the violin to soothe him one day and it really helped us both. I started to play different lullabies and my older two children started feeling calmer too."" When Izzy recently decided to go back in the studio to record a new album, which includes some of the lullabies she plays, she wanted to invite Rupert too. They recorded a new version of Somewhere In My Memory. Rupert is currently having brain scans after his memory started to decline, Izzy says, and there is a link between brain injuries and early onset dementia. It made her realise she might not have much time left to collaborate with her brother. ""I was worried that I neglected my relationship with Rupert after having children and we were not able to see him during Covid, but now I feel more at peace. ""Music has always been a language that my family has used when words were too difficult for us to speak. I wanted to reconnect with Rupert again and give him the space to share his talent. This has been very healing for me."" Izzy Judd and Rupert Johnston's single Somewhere in My Memory is out now. Izzy Judd's EP Moments is released on 16 February.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-67907355,London Tube strikes called off as more pay talks planned,"Strikes by London Underground workers which would have wiped out Tube services this week have been suspended, the RMT union has announced.",2024-01-08,"Strikes by London Underground workers which would have wiped out Tube services this week have been suspended, the RMT union has announced. Little or no service had been expected across the capital's entire network from Sunday evening to Friday morning. Some disruption on the Tube is still expected though due to the strikes being called off late on, TfL said. On Monday morning minor delays were reported on the Central Line due to a shortage of trains. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union had previously voted to take industrial action over a below-inflation pay increase of 5%. The union said on Sunday evening ""positive discussions"" meant further talks could take place. The 5% offer was described by Transport for London (TfL) as ""the most we can afford"". But it said an ""intervention"" by London's mayor had allowed pay talks to be reopened. The RMT's general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""Following further positive discussions, the negotiations on a pay deal for our London Underground members can now take place on an improved basis and mandate with significant further funding for a settlement being made available."" He described it as a ""significantly-improved funding position"" which meant scheduled strike action would be suspended ""with immediate effect"". ""We look forward to getting in to urgent negotiations with TfL in order to develop a suitable agreement and resolution to the dispute,"" he added. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""delighted"" the industrial action had been called off. Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent This is extremely unusual. I certainly can't remember strikes being called off at such a late stage. What has happened is the Mayor of London and his team have got more involved over the weekend. And extra money has been found. Sources have told me it is in the region of £30m. It does leave some potential problems though for TfL. Transport bosses said the 5% pay rise offer was ""final and full"". Now it is not. So that could impact its credibility in any future negotiations. Also, some other unions like Aslef have already agreed to the 5%. One representative has told me that will not be accepted now. And so this could open a real can of worms. Tfl said it will be meeting unions to decide the best way to use the extra funding to resolve the dispute. The suspension of action has happened so late in the day it is worth people checking before heading to the Tube on Monday. A TfL spokesperson said it remained the case that it could not ""afford any more"" than the original 5% pay offer but it had been ""made aware that the mayor was able to provide additional funds"". ""We will now meet with representatives of all the unions to agree on the best way for this funding to be used to resolve the current dispute. ""We always strive to work constructively with the unions and avoid disruption to London,"" they added. Mr Khan said the strikes would have ""caused huge disruption for Londoners and would have been a major blow to the capital's businesses at the worst possible time"".

The person who started teaching it has now been appointed an MBE after she started origami classes there. Helen Holtam is part of the Friends of Erlestoke Prison and began the classes in 2017. ""On Friday mornings, there's special classes, just fun classes for the prisoners,"" she said. Helen had taught challenging school pupils before so took on the task: ""I made it a safe place for everyone to come,"" she said. ""There were some rules - you know, everyone had to be kind. They folded and folded."" Explaining why it has been a success, she described prison as ""very hard, you don't have phone or internet, you have a lot of rules. ""All it needs is paper. I would teach them simple models in the class,"" she added. ""They made lots of cards. They would learn a model and take paper back to their cells. In lockdown, they were 22 hours in their cells, so it was something easy and satisfying they could do."" It has not just been a welcome activity though - the work itself has made around £50,000 for the Friends of Erlestoke Prison for rehabilitation. Helen said: ""There were some very long term, committed people - when they realised it could raise money as well, it was very satisfying. They knew it was going to a better cause."" The origami is sold on a website they developed called Origami Inside. During the pandemic, the classes had to stop. Then Helen moved - except the prisoners have carried on. ""I send in the materials, then they send me back the finished stuff which I send out to orders,"" she explained. Their work has also been featured in public, for example, prisoners contributed paper doves to a huge installation in Salisbury Cathedral in 2018. They also regularly decorate a tree for the annual Christmas Tree Festival at St Thomas's Church in Salisbury. Cards made by the group even won a silver award at the 2019 Koestler Awards for prisoners. The organisation asked those who joined what they made of it, with feedback ranging from it being an ""escape"", to it being something where one can ""relax and yet still be focused"". ""Whether in the class or substituting wasted time in front of the TV back in my cell,"" one inmate said. ""It's not every week that you can look back and see the benefits of your time, with origami you can as it's in front of you."" Mrs Holtam remembered one telling her: ""In 12 years in prison, I've forgotten who I was for a whole morning."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The MP for South West Surrey said hundreds of constituents had complained about the claims system. He also raised concerns that issues over the firm's infrastructure had ""not been resolved"" after the loss of water in November. Thames Water has since apologised. In November, a major incident was declared after thousands of customers in the Guildford and Godalming area were left without water for several days. Thames Water apologised, saying Shalford treatment works in Guildford had faced issues after Storm Ciarán. On BBC Radio Surrey Mr Hunt said ""people are finding they're not getting awarded the compensation that they should be getting"". ""I've had hundreds of messages, and some of these people have been given peanuts for not having had water for a week, or even told that they did have their water when they didn't,"" he said. He added residents were ""absolutely furious"" about the incident, which affected up to 12,000 people and businesses. ""Thames Water just need to get a grip on the problem,"" he said. The chancellor, who held a public meeting with Guildford MP Angela Richard and the interim co-chief executive of Thames Water in December, said he would hold another meeting with the company's outgoing chief this week. He said he was also in talks with Thames Water's compensation team and had invited the firm to attend another public meeting by spring. The company was also forced to apologise on Boxing Day after further outages in parts of Guildford. Mr Hunt said he was ""concerned that the fundamental problems"" with its ""antiquated"" infrastructure had ""not been resolved"". But he added Thames Water was putting in about £100m into the area as part of a government requirement for water companies to invest £56bn over 25 years. A Thames Water spokesperson said it was addressing claims on a case-by-case basis. ""We're very sorry to customers in Guildford and Godalming who were affected by water outages last November,"" they said. ""We have already credited over 12,000 customers' accounts, but should any customers have queries based on what they have already received, we ask that these queries are submitted to us no later than 31 January and we aim to respond within 20 workings days of receiving a request.""

Avon and Somerset Police is referring some women, who've admitted their offending, to Project SHE which is run by the Nelson Trust. One of the women, who we are calling Rosie, was initially questioned alongside an ex-partner. Police quickly recognised the 19-year-old needed a different type of help. When 'Rosie' met her Project SHE support worker, Kerenza Robinson-Barton, she was ready to accept any help ""that would help me move forward more positively"". ""She [Ms Robinson-Barton] started talking to me but not like a therapist or someone who was trying to undermine me - she was like a friend, just talking to me like another human being,"" said Rosie. ""I bawled my eyes out. It opened my eyes up that actually there are people there to help you and they're not against you."" SHE stands for 'support, help and empower'. Rosie said it helped her stop believing that everyone was against and thought she was ""a bad person"". ""Kerenza gave me the confidence to get rid of my old job - this new job now I absolutely love. ""It's like a whole new doorway - I have a new partner, we have a dog now: it's just all these things I didn't know were possible. ""If I wasn't given help by the police and I hadn't accepted help, I wouldn't have had any of this,"" said Rosie. Inspector Joe Piscina oversees Bridgwater police custody suite where women are identified for referral to Project SHE. He said referrals to the scheme ""depend on the offence"" and there are conditions relating to rehabilitation attached. ""It can be offences along the lines of theft, low level violence. Ten years ago a theft from a shop might be 'we'll charge them, send them to court' but Project SHE looks at the reasons why,"" he said. If the police refer to Project SHE the conditions of the caution are attending a set number of sessions with a support worker and engaging with their advice. ""It could be for example they're stealing a sandwich because they're not given any money from a previous relationship or a situation they find themselves in,"" said Inspector Piscina. He said he had ""no doubt it [SHE] reduces reoffending"" and has also reduced the impact on the wider community and the criminal justice system. Ms Robinson-Barton said the project works because it identifies women who have only just come into contact with criminal justice system. It diverts them down a more positive path before they end up down a spiral which could see them end up in prison. ""We can look in a holistic way at 'what in your life has led you here and what support do you need to try and prevent reoffending?'"" said Ms Robinson-Barton. She recalls a woman who had been given a conditional caution, driven to crime when her benefits had been ""messed up"" repeatedly. ""And so she robbed coffee and milk from a supermarket and got arrested,"" said Ms Robinson-Barton. ""Rather than going to court for that, because she freely admitted 'yes it was wrong for me to do that' she got a conditional caution. ""We looked at her debts and got her referred to financial support services. We got her involved in the community with some food parcels, and we looked at budgeting and ways to manage money better. ""Her benefits also got sorted but that doesn't affect the fact that she now has a seven-year criminal record,"" said Ms Robinson-Barton. ""I love what I do, I find it very rewarding.

Business and property access will remain open and footpaths will be closed alternately on each side of the street in two phases. The junction of Parliament Street and High Ousegate will also close to traffic as sliding bollards are installed alongside the fixed bollards already fitted, with alternative access via Goodramgate.

New wheelie bins with purple lids have been delivered to around 68,000 households across South Kesteven. The council said the first collection of the new bins will be in the week beginning 5 February, so people should start using them now. The aim of the project is to make recycling paper and cardboard easier. Until now, householders have put these items in their silver recycling bin, which meant it was often mixed with other materials. Around 30% of the recycling materials collected in the area are unable to be recycled, because some residents place it in the wrong bin and it becomes contaminated, according to South Kesteven District Council. A spokesperson said the new bin means clean, dry paper and card can be taken directly to a dedicated paper mill for recycling into paper-based products. Bins with purple lids for paper and cardboard have already been introduced in Boston, North Kesteven, West Lindsey and East Lindsey.

The stainless steel Rolex GMT Master wristwatch, which has a red and blue bezel, is expected to fetch up to £18,000 at auction in Shrewsbury. It was gifted to the Spanish pioneer for his well-documented oceanic expeditions in the 1960s and 1970s. The watch is being sold at Halls Fine Art on 6 March. Born in Santander, Spain in 1933, Vital Alsar Ramirez studied economics and began his career working in Europe and Canada. He was fascinated by early oceanic exploration and was inspired by Thor Heyerdahl's 1947 crossing of the Pacific between South America and Polynesia on a primitive raft called the Kon-Tiki. In 1966, Alsar set off on his first Pacific crossing from Ecuador using a raft constructed from balsa wood but was shipwrecked after only 90 days. His next attempt, in 1970, on a similar raft, called La Balsa, successfully saw him reach Mooloolaba in Australia after 163 days at sea, having travelled over 8,500 nautical miles. He led a further successful mission in 1973, this time on three rafts. Then in 1977, he built three small brigs in Guayaquil which he and his crew sailed down the Amazon river before crossing the Atlantic to reach Santander, a distance of 11,000 nautical miles. The seaman and explorer died in September 2020 at the age of 87. Alexander Clement, Halls Fine Art's watch specialist, said: ""Vital favoured the GMT Master watch because it was designed to allow up to three time zones to be read simultaneously and was an indispensable navigational tool for him.""

Underground electrical cables are being blamed for the last-minute change as the centre had been expected to open at its new site in Hull on Monday. Currently at Wilberforce Health Centre on Story Street, the walk-in service will now relocate to Hull Royal Infirmary at the end of January. The NHS said there would be ""no break in services for patients"". The service aims to reduce pressures on accident and emergency at the hospital, by cutting overcrowding, inappropriate attendances and waiting times. NHS Humber and North Yorkshire Integrated Care Board (ICB) said the walk-in service would continue to be provided by City Health Care Partnership CIC (CHCP). Gemma Bradley, head of urgent care services at the CHCP, said it would make it much easier for them to work with emergency staff at the hospital. ""Having the walk-in on the same site as the hospital will mean that if people need further treatment then they're in the right place."" The centre will continue to offer treatment for minor illness and injury in a newly refurbished clinical space. Additional minor injuries and diagnostic pathways will also be established to create a fully designated urgent treatment centre at the hospital from April 2024. Dr James Crick, from the ICB, said 500 people took part in a consultation ahead of the move and the ICB would monitor how the change was affecting patients. ""The change will ensure that services reflect the needs of our population and that people seeking care are placed on the right path from the very start of their patient journey,"" he said.

Siobhan McKenna says Raac-related closures at Aylesford School in Warwick meant her child ""had to teach herself"". School leaders have appealed for special exam considerations. The Department for Education (DfE) said it was not possible to make changes for only some groups of students. Across England, 231 schools and colleges have reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) within their buildings, with the number expected to rise. Ms McKenna's daughter is in Year 10 preparing for her GCSEs and has been attending school on a rotational basis as well as doing remote learning. ""It has had a terrible impact [on my daughter], she's been having to teach herself subjects that she's never done before, it's been really awful,"" Ms McKenna told Radio 4's World at One. ""It's horrible as a parent to sit and see your child struggling so much. ""We have been told that it's unlikely that the whole school will be reopened until September,"" she added. Aylesford is on a government complex cases list, after initial investigations led to the discovery of asbestos in buildings. The discovery of the substance is likely to complicate work to repair unstable concrete. Ms McKenna added: ""This is going to impact the students for the rest of their life and is going to stop them getting to sixth form or university. ""I have noticed a difference in her and her friends, they are stressed, struggling, and worried. ""It's just like being in Covid but on your own, it's the same kind of frustration and everybody else is carrying on around us as if nothing's happening. It is just an awful situation to be in."" Tim Hodgson, head teacher at Aylesford School, told BBC CWR: ""It has been very difficult for the whole school community. ""Regular information about our progress has been provided, often on a daily basis as we focus on the education of our children."" A DfE spokesperson said: ""We have asked awarding organisations to, where possible, agree longer extensions for coursework and non-examined assessment so that schools have as much time as possible to complete this important part of pupils' learning and qualifications.""

The Aardman Academy has returned to in-person tuition after classes moved online during the Covid pandemic. Animators will be taught in the same space where Oscar-winning Wallace & Gromit: The Wrong Trousers was shot 30 years ago. New entrant Lily Ward, 22, from Frome, said: ""It's cool to be here, I grew up watching these films."" The academy began when Aardman required more animators to work on the first Chicken Run film in 2000. Ms Ward has enrolled on a seven-month long stop motion course. So far she has finished pre-production, script writing and story development for her film which she pitched to Aardman. She said she is excited to have the rest of her lessons in the studio. ""It's very exciting. I never thought that this would happen. It's really cool how although we're still learning, it's really nice to be in a real studio environment,"" she said. Mark Hewis, head of Aardman Academy, said 13 students have enrolled on the course from the UK, Austria, Australia and more. ""A lot of students are coming here because they want to learn from the best people in the world,"" he said. ""And we're going to be supporting them every step of the way."" Alumni of the academy have gone on to work at Aardman. Maraike Kraemer completed the online stop motion course three years ago, then moved from Germany to work as an assistant animator on Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget. Ms Kraemer said the new intake of students will benefit from in-person teaching.

Leicestershire County Council said closures will be in place on the A606 Burton Road from Monday to 28 January. Works will be carried out to install telecommunications and drainage infrastructure as part of the bypass project. Construction of the north and east parts of Melton Mowbray's distributor road began in May last year. The road will be a 4.4 mile (7km) route between the A606 Nottingham Road and the A606 Burton Road. The council warned residents of the closure in December and advised motorists of diversion routes in an effort to ""minimise disruption"". Pedestrians and cyclists will still be able to access the route, but the latter must dismount as they pass through the works, the council said. A606 Nottingham Road in and out of Melton will remain open. A letter from Leicestershire County Council to residents read: ""The closure is required to safely undertake the installation of new BT infrastructure and the new drainage network across the A606 as part of the new roundabout construction. ""All diversion routes will be clearly signposted. We apologise in advance for any inconvenience caused during the construction of the project."" The project is planned to relieve traffic congestion in the town centre and unlock land for new housing. In October, it was revealed that the southern leg of the bypass was not viable due to spiralling costs. A council report said £27m of increased costs meant it could not afford the southern part of the road. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The charity is marking its 200th year in 2024 and said although it has helped so many animals, abandonment was currently at a three-year high. Through its branches in Burton upon Trent, Stafford, Wolverhampton and Staffordshire north, staff have helped microchip over 9,000 pets. Nationally, the charity has rehomed 405,839 pets since 2013, it said. But last year, the RSPCA said it received 72,050 reports about animal abandonment and neglect across the country - higher than in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Dermot Murphy, RSPCA inspectorate commissioner, said more animals needed help, but rehoming had been declining sharply leaving centres ""full to bursting"". ""We are also faced with increased bills and less donations due to the cost of living crisis which is one of the biggest challenges facing animal welfare right now - and this economic hardship is continuing into our 200th anniversary year,"" he said. ""But we are determined to rise to the challenge and help animals and pet owners who need us more than ever."" Figures provided by the charity show more than 10,000 animals were rehomed in both Staffordshire and the West Midlands, about 8,000 in Warwickshire and 5,000 across Worcestershire and Herefordshire.

The test car travelled around Culham Science Park, and the driver at the wheel was just there as a precaution. It used radar, lidar and other technology, it learnt as it drove and it reacted to other vehicles. Oxa, a technology firm based at the park, builds the software that enables any vehicle to be self-driving. Professor Paul Newman, from the developer, said: ""We're deploying it live now around the world, carrying passengers."" He believes the technology will not appear on private cars, but will be used for shared vehicles such as buses or airport minibuses. He said: ""I think that's how this technology arrives, it arrives in services where the economics is right."" Oxa's aim is not to produce vehicles or even the kit that keeps people safe. It designs the software, the artificial intelligence (AI), which it claims could be fitted to any vehicle. Mr Newman said: ""There's a revolution coming about how we move things and it's going to be software driven, not vehicle driven. ""The revolution now is that you no longer will need to have one operator per vehicle in the vehicle, you will have one operator for many vehicles, not in the vehicle, doing different things."" The developer has also tested the technology on an off-road test vehicle which can function entirely on its own. Currently, fully automated driving systems are not legal in the UK and the Ford Mustang Mach-E is the only one that can legally self-steer on British roads. It can only do this on motorways, with the driver being monitored. The system alerts the driver after four seconds of inattention, to ensure they remain focused on the road. In November last year, the Government introduced a bill to regulate the use of automated vehicles on UK roads and in other public places. Due to the Automated Vehicles Bill, before these vehicles are allowed on UK roads, they will now have to meet or exceed rigorous new safety requirements, as set out in law. Every authorised self-driving vehicle will have a corresponding Authorised Self-Driving Entity - often the manufacturer - which will be responsible for the behaviour of the vehicle when self-driving. Companies will have ongoing obligations to keep their vehicles safe and ensure that they continue to drive in accordance with British laws. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

The crossing, which links Chelsea and Battersea, has had a three-tonne weight restriction since 2012 but it was only managed using width restriction posts. Cameras have now been installed to monitor the bridge with penalty charge notices being issued from Thursday. The council said it wanted to protect Albert Bridge ""for the long term"". The Grade II*-listed structure was completed in 1873 and is one of the oldest spanning the River Thames in the capital. Originally built as a form of cable-stayed bridge, it was once nicknamed ""the trembling lady"" because it had a tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it. Indeed signs are still attached on the former tollbooths on the bridge warning troops based at what was once the nearby Chelsea Barracks to ""break step"" when marching across it. The council said as Hammersmith Bridge remained closed to motor vehicles due to cracks appearing in the structure, it was taking its ""responsibility to protect the iconic landmark and vital river crossing very seriously"". As a result it has installed the cameras, put up warning signs on nearby streets and issued more than 1,400 warning notices to drivers since 6 December. From 11 January, penalty notices of £130 will start being issued to drivers of goods vehicles identified as over three tonnes, although the charge would be reduced to £65 if paid within 14 days. Cem Kemahli, lead member for planning and public realm, said: ""Hammersmith Bridge has been closed to motor traffic for five years. We don't want to be in the same position here in Kensington and Chelsea, which is why we are starting to enforce the weight restriction on Albert Bridge. ""The bridge is structurally sound and perfectly safe, but it is a listed structure and an important river crossing so we need to make sure we protect both the surface and the structure for the long term."" The council added it only had the power to enforce weight limits against goods vehicles, but asked drivers of other vehicles that weigh over three tonnes to stick to other routes in order ""to protect the bridge"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-67890997,"Swans targeted by catapults, Berkshire sanctuary says",A charity has warned of a series of violent attacks on swans.,2024-01-08,"A charity has warned of a series of violent attacks on swans. Swan Support in Datchet, Berkshire, said it had been receiving a ""worrying number"" of calls from the RSPCA and police about the birds being injured. It said swans in the area were being hit by catapults and air rifles - with four attacks recorded in December alone. The rescue centre said the attacks had become more frequent in the past two years. The most recent report came on 23 December, when the team was alerted to a swan that had allegedly been shot at Staines-upon-Thames in Surrey. Upon arrival, they found four more swans that had sustained injuries from a catapult or air rifle. Joanne De Nobriga, who volunteers with Swan Support, believed younger people were responsible for the attacks. ""I think it's a rise in youngsters who are bored - they get hold of air rifles and they think it's fun,"" she said. ""I just don't understand it."" Ms De Nobriga said she had experienced reports of ""whole families of swans"" being shot. Some die, while others have to undergo surgery to remove the pellets. She said: ""Sometimes they're left with disfigurements or injuries that mean they need to go into a sanctuary because they won't survive in the wild."" The charity campaigns for harder punishments to deter wildlife crime and regularly trains emergency services in the catching and handling of swans. Ms De Nobriga said there was still more work to be done in order to protect the species. She said: ""I know the police are extremely stretched and sometimes wildlife doesn't come up as a priority."" But she added that there needed to be ""more focus"" on wildlife crime, with forces following up on reports more frequently. The BBC has contacted Thames Valley Police for comment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67910064,NI Weather: Air pollution warning due to cold weather,"High and moderate levels of air pollution are expected in Northern Ireland until Friday, due to the cold, settled weather and anticipated increased use of home heating.",2024-01-08,"High and moderate levels of air pollution are expected in Northern Ireland until Friday, due to the cold, settled weather and anticipated increased use of home heating. Temperatures fell to below -5C on Sunday night and are expected to do so again on Monday night. The chilly conditions have led to widespread frost and ice. But the cold and calm weather is expected to prevent emissions from home heating and transport to be dispersed. This has prompted the Department of Agriculture, Environment, and Rural Affairs (Daera) and the Department of Health to issue a 'High Air Pollution Alert'. Users of the Air Aware app received a text alert warning of the ""potential for isolated areas of high air pollution to occur"" . Those with respiratory and cardiac conditions are advised to be aware of their symptoms and get medical advice if they notice any change. Approximately two-thirds of Northern Ireland uses oil for home heating, which releases particles that may be inhaled. In the UK, most air pollution information services use the Air Quality Index and banding system approved by the Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollution. It uses an index between one and 10 to communicate information about air pollution levels in a simple way, similar to the pollen index. Air quality is based on five pollutants including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and other particles. On Monday, Strathfoyle, just outside Londonderry, had recorded high levels of pollution, registering at seven on a scale from 1-10. Moderate levels of five were recorded in Belfast city centre, Rosemount in Derry, and Newtownstewart. The cold weather caused disruption to some areas on Monday, with icy conditions on some roads. A yellow weather warning for ice was issued for large parts of counties Armagh and Down. Given the weak January sunshine and mostly calm conditions, the fog lingered all day across some areas of Northern Ireland on Sunday. A persistent fog bank formed in Belfast Lough which was observed by many people who were out walking in the surrounding hills. It was particularly noticeable as the bright yellow tops of Samson and Goliath poked through the top of the fog bank. The Harland and Wolff cranes are approximately 100m high and many of the Belfast hills are above this level. If you were at the top of Cavehill, Divis Mountain or the Holywood hills, you would be looking down on the fog bank with blue sky above. This phenomenon occurs from time to time when the weather situation is just right. An area of high pressure needs to be dominant with cold air trapped underneath, clear skies and calm conditions. This allows the fog to form in the first place and the area of high pressure overhead acts like a lid preventing the cold air underneath escaping. The cold air sinks into the bottom of the basin from the surrounding hills. A temperature inversion forms whereby the air above the fog layer is warmer than the air at the bottom. The fog becomes trapped because the January sun is too weak to burn the fog off from above and unless there is a change of wind direction, an increase in wind or drier air is fed in from somewhere else, the fog has nowhere to go. The temperature inversion will also trap pollutants near the ground and prevent them from mixing up through the atmosphere, thereby reducing the quality of the air surrounding us.",['N/A'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/548D/production/_132254612_mon7stephenhenderson.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A2AD/production/_132254614_mon1alistairhamillbelfastfog.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67896399,Belfast City Council increases funding for children's charity,A Belfast charity for children with special needs has had its proposed council funding increased after facing a potential cut of 97%.,2024-01-08,"A Belfast charity for children with special needs has had its proposed council funding increased after facing a potential cut of 97%. Sólás is set to receive about £308,000 for a building project following a decision on Monday night. It was originally earmarked for £800,000. However, there was a political row over proposals to reduce its allocation to £24,744 and share the rest among other community groups. Other parties on Belfast City Council branded the plan by Sinn Féin and DUP councillors a ""shameless carve-up"", but Sinn Féin said not all funding applicants can be successful. The issue was debated on Monday night at a meeting of Belfast City Council behind closed doors. A proposal to reinstate the original £800,000 was voted down. But a majority backed a DUP proposal to award £500,000 to both the Market Development Association and the Greater Village Regeneration Trust, and about £308,000 each to three other groups - Sólás, Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group (LORAG), and Fitzroy Presbyterian Church. The money is part of the council's £10m Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund, aimed at helping groups deliver capital projects in their communities. Two of the parents  with children who access Sólás services addressed Monday evening's council meeting. Jean, whose son has special needs, told the chamber Sólás had been a ""major turning point for her son,"" where he was able to make friends, go to summer and weekend clubs and be with ""people like him,"" and that it was vital for her family. Speaking before the meeting, Belfast's deputy lord mayor, Green Party councillor Áine Groogan, said the original proposals to reduce funding to £24,744 was ""utterly reprehensible"" and one of the worst political ""carve-ups"" she has witnessed on the council. ""A charity like Sólás is a lifeline for so many families and this was an opportunity for Belfast City Council to recognise that,"" she said. ""Instead, Sinn Féin/DUP have insulted them by saying it's only worthy of £24,000. They need to get their priorities straight."" Speaking after Monday's meeting, Alliance councillor Micky Murray he said he was disappointed that the debate on the funding decision for Sólás had been ""restricted to a closed session"". Twenty-one projects were shortlisted for neighbourhood regeneration funding, with £1.92m due for six schemes in south Belfast. Its area working group - a sub-committee made up of local councillors - recommended Sólás should be allocated £800,000 to develop a three-storey building and outdoor space for the charity. The rest of the funding was to be divided equally (£224,949 each) between the other five groups - the Market Development Association: Greater Village Regeneration Trust: Hearth Historic Buildings Trust: Lower Ormeau Residents' Action Group (LORAG): and Fitzroy Presbyterian Church. But at a council committee in December, Sinn Féin and the DUP overturned the plan. Their councillors instead proposed more than doubling to £650,000 the funding allocated to both the Market Development Association and the Greater Village Regeneration Trust. The new plan also increased to £300,000 the funding earmarked for LORAG and Fitzroy Presbyterian Church. Originally Sólás had its funding cut to £24,744, while the Hearth Historic Buildings Trust - which wants to redevelop Riddel's Warehouse on Ann Street - had its share reduced to zero. Joan Henderson from Sólás said they were ""absolutely astounded"" by the initial proposal. She said it was ""an insult and an affront to children and young people with disabilities and their families"". ""It seems very, very strange to have been the priority project in the area, to then become the fifth priority,"" she said. ""Anybody looking at that, regardless of what background they come from, would say that just doesn't look right. That looks very unfair, and it feels very unfair."" Ms Henderson said if councillors were committed to ""equality and inclusion"", they would reinstate the £800,000 for Sólás and expand the funding available for other south Belfast projects. Speaking earlier, Sinn Féin said it ""supports and values the work of Sólás and the dozens of other groups in the city which applied for funding"". A party spokesman said applications to the fund totalled £49m but ""unfortunately not every group was going to be successful"". He said there was ""cross-party agreement"" at the council committee ""for 14 out of 15 projects from right across the city"". Emily Gallagher, whose son Oisin has been with Sólás  since 2009, said that there is ""nowhere else other than Sólás"" for her son and his peers to go. She told BBC NI's Talkback programme that the money was needed for a new building, as the organisation is currently operating out of temporary buildings that are ""not suitable"". Louise Conville, a former service-user at Sólás and the sister of a current service user, agreed that the new building was needed. ""I fear if this building that they're planning is not sorted out then there will not be that service for my younger brother who greatly needs it,"" she said. The Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund is aimed at projects to ""develop neighbourhood tourism, improve environmental sustainability and support the city's social economy"", according to the council's website. It said projects progressing to the third and final stage of the application process would look at procurement and detailed costings. ""Once this information has been received and carefully considered, councillors will make a final decision on which projects will go ahead under the fund,"" the council added. ""Construction is likely to begin on the successful projects from 2024 onwards.""","['Belfast South', 'Belfast City Council']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/E968/production/_132225795_solas1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2A64/production/_132225801_ainegroogan1.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/11C94/production/_132225827_solas4-1.jpg']",['Brendan Hughes'],UK,N.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67913143,Gerry Kelly libel case against journalist thrown out,A court has thrown out a libel case brought by Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly.,2024-01-08,"A court has thrown out a libel case brought by Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly. Mr Kelly had sought damages over two radio interviews given by writer Malachi O'Doherty, in which he stated Mr Kelly had shot a prison officer during the Maze escape in 1983. The High Court in Belfast struck out Mr Kelly's case, describing it as ""scandalous, frivolous and vexatious"". Mr Kelly said the ruling, published on Monday, was a ""substantive judgement,"" which he would study with his lawyer. Mr Kelly was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from the Maze prison near Lisburn. During the break-out, prison officer John Adams was shot in the head. Mr Kelly has never admitted shooting him and was found not guilty at a trial in 1987. Mr Kelly had claimed Dr O'Doherty's comments, made in 2019, had gravely damaged his reputation and brought his standing as an MLA into disrepute. However, Dr O'Doherty pointed out that the prison officer had claimed Mr Kelly fired the shot. He also argued there was no damage to Mr Kelly's reputation, as he had served prison sentences for the 1973 Old Bailey bombings and he is someone publicly identified as a former IRA member. Mr Kelly has also written books which deal with the escape, although they conceal who fired the shot. In the ruling, Master Evan Bell stated: ""What Mr Kelly has written in his books, in my view, makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to rebut the argument that he was not a joint tortfeasor in respect of the battery. ""Even if one accepts Mr Kelly has not explicitly admitted pulling the trigger, the content of his books appears to make Mr Kelly civilly liable, on the balance of probabilities, for the shooting of Mr Adams. ""In the light of that, these defamation proceedings against Dr O'Doherty are completely untenable. ""For that reason the court strikes them out on the basis that they are scandalous, frivolous and vexatious."" The ruling went on to characterise Mr Kelly's case as what is known as a Slapp action - Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. It stated that on balance, the proceedings ""were initiated not for the genuine purposes of vindicating a reputation injured by defamatory statements, but rather for the purpose of stifling the voices of Mr Kelly's troublesome critics"". Speaking to the BBC's Evening Extra programme, Malachi O'Doherty said he did not know what the costs would have amounted to if he had lost the case, but he said the law of defamation was a ""high stakes"" business. ""I'm not a rich man.  I do own my house - I would have been liable potentially to lose my house,"" the freelance journalist said. ""The other possibility was that I would have lost all credibility as a journalist by conceding."" He welcomed the fact the court had recognised Mr Kelly's action as a so-called SLAPP case. ""The danger is that journalists may be wary of saying anything critical about Sinn Féin members because of the frequency with which writs are flying. ""I would urge people not to be intimidated."" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has also welcomed the ruling. Its assistant general secretary, Séamus Dooley, described it as ""extremely significant"" in the context of concern over the use of Slapp lawsuits against journalists. In a statement, Mr Dooley said Mr Kelly's case had no ""realistic prospect of success"" but yet ""the shadow of defamation proceedings has loomed over Malachi O'Doherty"" since 2020. ""Such threats have a chilling impact on journalists and journalism. The unambiguous language used in the determination should give those intent on using SLAPPs pause for thought,"" he added.",['N/A'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14F41/production/_132252858_gettyimages-488147039-1.jpg', ""https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1D65/production/_132252570_malachio'doherty02.jpg""]","[""Julian O'Neill""]",UK,N.

Mr Kerr, 54,  died after being shot during a robbery at a sorting office in the city, just months after the IRA ceasefire in 1994. The IRA later admitted that its members were involved in the killing. James Seamus Fox, 64, of Carewamean Road in Jonesborough is on trial for the murder. He is also charged with stealing £131,000, possession of a firearm and membership of a proscribed organisation. The Diplock no-jury trial, which is expected to last three weeks, began on Monday before Mr Justice Fowler. Craigavon Crown Court heard that the case had arisen following the 2019 re-examining of items recovered after the fatal robbery which highlighted DNA connections to Mr Fox. Giving an outline of the prosecution case, Samuel Magee KC said that on the morning of 10 November 1994 a routine delivery of cash arrived at Newry's postal sorting office on Clanrye Avenue at 9.05am. A total of more than £232,000 was delivered. Frank Kerr was counting this money in the Registered Letter Enclosure. At 9:45am, a post office van arrived at the gates. The court heard that a man dressed in post office uniform said ""priority services Belfast"". The van was allowed through the first gate. At this point, armed men tied up the security guard and his colleague in the security hut. The gang of at least four men were communicating by walkie talkies and they were all wearing post office-style clothing as well as make up, fake tan and glasses. The court heard at least two had firearms. Staff were detained at gunpoint. One of the gang made his way to the room Mr Kerr was working in and the court heard that Mr Kerr tried to force the man out of the room. A short time later he was shot through the neck. One of his colleagues was knocked unconscious.  When he awoke he called for help. By this stage the gang had escaped. Mr Kerr was transferred to hospital but was pronounced dead. It is the Crown's case that Mr Fox was one of the gang present. The court heard that at 10:40am on the day of Mr Kerr's shooting a Renault vehicle was seen by police on the Ballintemple Road beside Killeavy Castle in Meigh, seven miles from the murder scene. Police saw a car parked on the wrong side of the road and they blocked the road. A man got out of the car and ran towards Killeavy castle. Shots were fired by police but the man escaped. Two remaining males were apprehended from the vehicle. They were Declan McComish and Kevin Donegan who were later convicted for assisting an offender. The vehicle was searched and a post office uniform was found in the rear, on the floor. The prosecution said there were blood stains on the trousers, blood on the jacket and an anorak that had discharge residue. According to Mr Magee KC, this was ""a professionally-planned, high-risk raid by at least four people but with the help of others"". ""They had inside information,"" he continued. ""They were aware of a delivery and they were aware of the identity of some staff. They had at least two weapons. ""It matters not if the person fired the shot but that it can be proved that they were willingly present. ""Whoever wore that uniform was party to the enterprise. There is evidence the defendant wore those clothes."" This, Mr Magee said, related to the subsequent DNA analysis of tape lifts and clothing. The first witness was police photographer [Charles McAteer] who recorded both scenes on the day. Defence barrister John Kearney KC pressed the witness on what he recalled of the day. When asked if there was a potential that he may have moved items at the postal office,  he said, ""the only thing I touched was my camera"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67892255,Junior doctors in NI balloted for first time over pay,Junior doctors in Northern Ireland are to be balloted about strike action for the first time.,2024-01-08,"Junior doctors in Northern Ireland are to be balloted about strike action for the first time. The ballot will run for six weeks and could result in a 24-hour walkout. A newly qualified doctor in Northern Ireland earns £26,000 per year: in England the starting rate is over £33,000, and in Scotland it is £32,000. The Republic of Ireland's pay grades operate differently, but junior doctors are paid a higher rate than their colleagues in Northern Ireland. In England, junior doctors started six days of strike action at 07:00 GMT on Wednesday in their dispute over pay. Northern Ireland's Department of Health has said there is ""no scope for a pay offer to be tabled for this year"". Dr Steven Montgomery, a paediatric junior doctor in the Southern Trust, called for ""pay parity, better working conditions and to save the NHS"". ""The main reason we need pay parity is so we stop haemorrhaging staff. We are losing staff to multiple countries, and these are highly skilled, qualified staff that we can't afford to lose,"" he said. ""As a junior doctor you just feel burnt out. The feeling among staff is that morale is low the lowest I have ever seen since I have been working in the health care system."" Northern Ireland Junior Doctor Chair (NIJDC) Dr Fiona Griffin said the ballot is unprecedented among junior doctors in Northern Ireland. ""Our health service cannot afford to lose these doctors, which is why we need to address the issues around pay urgently. This can be done with an immediate above-inflation pay rise and a commitment to full pay restoration in Northern Ireland,"" she said. Dr Griffin called for the government to engage with NIJDC as a ""matter of urgency"". She said failure to address pay in Northern Ireland now equates to a 30% reduction in 15 years. Dr Edwina Hegarty said ""no-one will listen"" to the concerns that junior doctors have about pay, leading to them leaving Northern Ireland ""in their droves"". ""The word 'junior' can be misleading"" she added. ""I am a junior doctor: I qualified in 2013 and I'm a senior registrar. ""I make life and death decisions daily."" Dr Montgomery, who works as a senior registrar at Craigavon Area Hospital, said Northern Ireland has lost too many doctors to other countries which means wards are struggling every day to meet demand, and not just at winter time. Originally from Limavady, he qualified in 2017. He said he was reluctant to leave Northern Ireland but wants a better work-life balance with his partner who also works in the health service. On average, he works 48 hours a week but realistically it works out at approximately 55 hours. ""Too few doctors mean it is a lot harder to get time off for annual leave even for things like weddings. ""I have friends who struggled to get their own wedding day off even though they let the department know 18-24 months before their wedding,"" Dr Montgomery said. Each year, Northern Ireland employs about 270 newly qualified doctors. In 2023, there were 20 jobs that became vacant because the doctors chose to work outside Northern Ireland. According to health unions, the ongoing negativity is having an impact on attracting younger people to the profession. A potential walk-out would impact on waiting lists and patients waiting to be seen on wards with consultants expected to cover junior doctor roles. The BMA has stressed that strike action is a last resort and it would welcome any approach from the Northern Ireland secretary to talk to them. The union warned that if there is no progress they would have to escalate action to longer strikes. In a statement, the Department of Health said it ""fully understands the scale of the frustration among health and care staff about pay"". ""Unfortunately, the 2023/24 health budget provided no scope for a pay offer to be tabled for this year,"" it added. ""We recognise that this is not a sustainable position and remain committed to pursuing all avenues to help achieve a resolution. ""The department respects the right of every individual to take industrial action. However, doing so at this time - with no route to a successful resolution currently available - would only further add to already severe pressures on services."" On Friday, the Royal College of Nursing announced it would be taking strike action, along with unions representing some other health sectors, on 18 January.","['Strike action', 'NI Health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16C58/production/_132227239_edwina.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6023/production/_132211642_gettyimages-1898443223.jpg']",['Marie-Louise Connolly'],UK,N.

The controversial act became law in September, despite opposition from Dublin and all Northern Ireland's main political parties. Ireland is to dispute the law in the European Court of Human Rights. But Chris Heaton-Harris has again challenged Dublin on its record regarding legacy cases. In a letter to Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Micheál Martin, the Northern Ireland secretary also questioned the handling of prosecutions since 1998. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) confirmed to the PA news agency that a letter had been issued formally criticising the timing of the Irish government's decision during ""a delicate time"" in Northern Ireland amid efforts to restore power-sharing at Stormont. ""The secretary of state, in his letter, repeats his call for the Irish government to clarify the number of criminal prosecutions brought in Ireland since 1998 relating to Troubles-related cases, and presses the Irish government more widely to answer questions regarding its own record on tackling legacy issues in its own jurisdiction,"" the NIO said in a statement to PA. It is understood the British ambassador to Ireland issued the letter to the Irish government on Sunday. Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that Mr Martin was aware of the letter and would respond to Mr Heaton-Harris ""in due course"". ""At Stormont House, a collective way forward on legacy was agreed, along with most parties in Northern Ireland,"" a spokesperson said. ""This included the two governments signing an international agreement. ""Regrettably the British government decided on a different approach, unilaterally."" The spokesperson said compliance of the legislation with the European Convention on Human Rights would be ""tested by the European Court of Human Rights"". ""In the meantime, the two governments have much to work on together."" Aspects of the recently passed UK law include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests. Critics argued the law gave an amnesty and removed access to justice. In December Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his administration was left with ""no option"" but to legally challenge the UK government over the legacy act. He said the ""strong"" legal advice was that the UK Legacy Act breached the UN Convention on Human Rights. Reacting to Mr Heaton-Harris's letter, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he agreed with the NI secretary on the ""double standards"" of the Irish government on legacy. ""Whilst we opposed what the UK government are doing, and continue to oppose this amnesty that they have brought forward in their legacy proposals, we see the same approach taken by the Irish government, indeed over many years,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""As the secretary of state has pointed out, there have been no prosecutions by the Irish government, no attempt to prosecute those who were involved in terrorist activity in their jurisdiction."" In response, Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy has said people ""shouldn't be distracted by records"". ""Let's not kid ourselves that it's about the narrow ground of prosecutions, and who prosecuted who - this is about the British government effectively shutting down its role in the conflict,"" he told the programme. Fergus O'Dowd, a Fine Gael member of the Dáil (Irish Parliament), argued that the Irish government has been rigorous with regard to Troubles-related prosecutions. He also told Good Morning Ulster that the Irish government had ""no choice"" but to reluctantly take on a legal case to challenge the bill. Mr O'Dowd, who is the chairman of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, said both governments ""need to get closer together"" following Brexit. ""We want relations to get better,"" he said. ""But [the Irish government] have clearly defined objectives in relation to human rights and that's not going to change."" Victims and survivors have already taken action against the UK government at the High Court in Belfast, opposing the bill which Boris Johnson, then-prime minister, said in 2021 was to ""draw a line under the Troubles"". The 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland cost more than 3,500 lives and left thousands of people seriously injured. The legislation also brought an end to all new inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. Ireland's case is being taken under the European Convention on Human Rights. It's been almost three weeks since Dublin decided to push back legally and politically against London's legacy act. But diplomatic relations have taken a further dive as the UK's ambassador to Ireland, Paul Johnston, issued the letter to the Irish government. In it Chris Heaton-Harris again warned Micheál Martin that it's a ""delicate time"" in Northern Ireland while efforts to restore power-sharing at Stormont go on. And he challenged Dublin on its record regarding legacy cases and its handling of prosecutions since 1998. The Irish government has insisted its only option was to take the case, which could take years to conclude.","['The Troubles', 'NI Brexit', 'Dublin']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1E48/production/_132225770_960c2dc5e002e71d94d9588954cc96dad7aaa209.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6617/production/_115553162_soldiersrunfrombomb.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/149F8/production/_132227448_3a44f7b66b6c5101b17d4583e9ed566d9cb58cb7.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9474/production/_118840083_jaynemccormack_tr_v2-nc.png']",['N/A'],UK,N.

The construction firm, based in the north-east of Scotland, said it faced ""significant challenges"" since Covid. It comes after an attempt to sell the company by its chairman Stewart Milne fell through last year. Administrator Teneo said 217 jobs would be affected, with hundreds of other sub-contractor roles also expected to be impacted. Six of the company's subsidiaries have also been placed into administration, but its north-west England arm has not. Trade roles working on the housebuilder's sites will also go as a result of the firm's collapse. The administrators said sub-contractors should not undertake any more work for the business, and site access - for example to collect equipment - should not be attempted unless approved by the administrators. Teneo said the company was ""exploring its options"" but was looking to work with other developers on the completion of unfinished sites. Buyers who have purchased or reserved homes from Stewart Milne Group and have not yet moved in will be contacted by the administrators directly. Current residents with outstanding works are asked to contact the SMHomeowners@teneo.com for further information. Adele MacLeod of Teneo said: ""The downturn in the UK housing market combined with an extensive sales process not resulting in any viable offers has ultimately led to the need for the directors to place Stewart Milne Group Limited and some of its subsidiaries into administration, regretfully with some immediate redundancies. ""We continue to assess all the options in respect of the group's Scottish development sites and encourage any party with an interest to get in touch."" The house builder, which develops sites across north east and central Scotland and north west England, was put up for sale in 2022 after its founder Stewart Milne announced his intention to retire, but the sale was suspended due to ""economic uncertainty"" and market conditions. It was relisted for sale in July 2023, however failed to attract a viable buyer. The company reported a boost in profits for the 21/22 financial year having sold its timber systems business in December 2021. It recorded pre-tax profits of £16.5m for the year to the end of October 2022. However, turnover fell year-on-year by £48.7m to £172.4m as house sales fell by nearly 30% to 583. A spokeswoman for Lloyds Banking Group stated that they had attempted to find a solution that would place the business on a ""sounder financial footing"" and avoid insolvency. She added: ""Unfortunately, despite several years of support and forbearance, including multiple maturity extensions to the borrowing, this has not been possible in this instance."" The business was started by former Aberdeen Football Club chairman Stewart Milne in 1975 after he qualified as an electrician. He postponed his retirement in an attempt to secure the future of the firm amid talks with ""seriously interested parties"". Mr Milne, 73, said: ""I am devastated by this totally unexpected outcome of the sale process and struggling to accept it, given the profound impact it will have on employees, sub-contractors, suppliers and customers. ""Stewart Milne Group was up for sale and, following significant interest, two bids were submitted. The bank has not accepted either bid and withdrawn its funding. ""I tried everything I could to find a way to achieve a better outcome for the business and the people who depend on it. ""I believe one of the bids could have delivered a comparable, financial return to administration and, crucially, allowed the business to continue to operate, safe-guarding hundreds of jobs and protecting livelihoods."" SNP MP for Aberdeen South, Stephen Flynn, said the news would be a bitter blow to workers and all those involved with the company. Teneo said 54 employees had been retained to assist in the administration process. An additional 58 workers from the north-west England operation have also been kept on.","['Construction industry', 'Scotland business']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1691D/production/_132254429_milne.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16B11/production/_132254929_milne3.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F7D5/production/_132254436_milne2.png']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67911483,Missing Stone of Destiny chip found in SNP cupboard,"A ""missing"" fragment of the Stone of Destiny gifted to Alex Salmond is being held in storage by the SNP.",2024-01-08,"A ""missing"" fragment of the Stone of Destiny gifted to Alex Salmond is being held in storage by the SNP. Newly released Scottish government documents revealed the former first minister received the chip in 2008. The chip was initially feared lost, but has since been uncovered in a cupboard at the SNP HQ. Conservative politicians called for the chip to be donated to a new museum in Perth which will house the rest of the ancient symbolic stone. The stone, also known as the Stone of Scone, was used as the coronation location for Scottish kings until it was seized and taken to Westminster Abbey by King Edward I of England in 1296 during the wars of independence. Then in 1950, four students broke into Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day and stole the stone so they could ""repatriate"" it to Scotland. The group were funded and backed by SNP co-founder John MacCormick. According to Scottish Cabinet papers released on 1 January, it was Mr MacCormick's son, Prof Sir Neil MacCormick, who presented Alex Salmond with the fragment of the stone back in 2008. Mr Salmond, who was first minister from 2007 until 2014, said the fragment was handed to the SNP for safekeeping after he had ""checked"" with Historic Scotland that it was not wanted in the public collection. However, the public body said it had ""no records"" of that check taking place. SNP activist Stewart Duncan told The National newspaper that on a visit to the party's HQ he had seen the ""small fragment of stone"" in a ""clear plastic box"". He added: ""I was quite shocked that it was just tucked away in a cupboard. Incredible to see though."" The SNP said it was unable to verify whether the fragment had actually come from the historic artefact. A spokesperson explained: """"The SNP has a small stone chip in storage. It is claimed to be a fragment of the Stone of Scone but, much like the stone in Edinburgh Castle, its provenance has not been established."" Mr Salmond told the Sunday Mail: ""I was accused of having 'stolen' the fragment and its return was demanded to someone, somewhere. ""And then lo and behold it turned up in SNP HQ at the end of the week. No doubt this came as a red-faced surprise to the blue Tory gang."" The UK government's Scottish ­Secretary, Alister Jack, and his ­predecessor Michael ­Forsyth said Mr Salmond should not have accepted the gift in the first place, and called for it to be put on display alongside the rest of the stone. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said it was one of Scotland's most important cultural artefacts and should not be kept in a cupboard in an SNP office. The Stone of Destiny is regarded as one of Scotland's most important cultural artefacts because it was used as the coronation seat for Scottish monarchs for more than 700 years before being stolen by England's Edward I in the late 13th century. It remained south of the border for 654 years, during which time it was built into the base of a chair on which various English and British monarchs were crowned. On Christmas Day 1950, a group of four Scottish students stole the stone from Westminster Abbey, with plans to repatriate it to Scotland. It was found, covered with a saltire, on the high altar at the ruined Arbroath Abbey in 1951, months after it was taken from Westminster Abbey. From there, it was returned to London where it remained until 1996, when it was sent back to be put on display in Edinburgh Castle. It has remained there ever since bar a brief sojourn back to Westminster Abbey for the coronation of King Charles III. The stone will be moved from Edinburgh Castle to a new museum in Perth when it opens in the spring. That is if the current stone is accepted as the original. Legend suggests monks at the monastery threw the original in the River Tay to prevent English soldiers getting their hands on it, while other stories allege copies were made in 1950 and the one set to be moved to Perth is fake.","['Perth', 'SNP (Scottish National Party)', 'Alex Salmond', 'Edinburgh']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15827/production/_132230188_stone.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/98BF/production/_132230193_beab287f18731f398844e8b84d479b912cad8371.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

More than 700 sub-postmasters were accused of wrongdoing based on information from a faulty computer system. The charges included false accounting, theft and fraud. Some of those convicted were jailed, while others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Others have since died. The scandal took place between 1999 and 2015. Although it has been public knowledge for years with an inquiry ongoing, the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) wrote to 73 potential victims in Scotland in 2020 but only 16 have come forward to have their convictions quashed. Six people were then given permission by the SCCRC to appeal Horizon convictions in court but only two have been overturned so far. The other four are still awaiting an outcome. The first minister was asked about potential legal moves after the Conservative MP Sir David Davis said there was no reason why a ""mass appeal"" could not take place. Mr Yousaf said: ""It should not have taken a television drama to get the government to take action. ""The Scottish National Party has been asking for action in relation to Horizon and the injustices done to postmasters and sub-postmasters for many years. ""I think the idea of almost a mass exoneration is one that is very worthy of consideration."" The first minister also said there were ""serious questions"" for those involved, especially Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who was postal affairs minister in the coalition government. Sir Ed has said he was ""deeply misled by Post Office executives"". UK ministers met on Monday to consider ways of clearing the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters. One former Perth and Kinross postmaster, who was wrongly accused of stealing £17,500 during the Horizon scandal, said he was put through ""hell on earth"". Chris Dawson lost his home and three businesses in Pitlochry and Kinloch Rannoch. Mr Dawson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that he refused to accept a plea deal after being interviewed under caution over the missing money. Asked what the last 14 years had been like for him, he said: ""Absolute hell on earth. ""I lost all three businesses. I lost my house. My marriage collapsed. I suffered mental health issues. ""The upset to my wife and to my two daughters, who were then only eight and 11, was horrendous."" Mr Dawson also told the programme he felt as if he was ""one person up against the establishment"". Speaking in the House of Commons, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross described the matter as ""an appalling scandal"". Mr Ross called for collaboration between the UK government and the Scottish government regarding those affected in Scotland. People whose Horizon convictions are overturned are entitled to apply for £600,000 compensation. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from prosecutions in England. Police Scotland said it was not currently investigating but ""is liaising with other UK law enforcement partners and any information received will be assessed."" The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would ""strongly support"" the honours committee if it chose to look into revoking the CBE of former Post Office boss Paula Vennells.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgekly911x0o,Teenager taken off suicide watch hours before death,N/A,2024-01-08,"A 16-year-old who took his own life in Polmont Young Offenders Institution had been removed from suicide watch hours earlier, a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) heard.William Brown, also known as William Lindsay, was remanded in custody after being deemed a ""potential risk to public safety"" three days before his death.The joint inquiry at Falkirk Sheriff Court is investigating his death and that of 21-year-old Katie Allan.Both were found dead in their cells in separate incidents at Polmont Young Offenders Institution in 2018.The inquiry is expected to last about three weeks.It aims to determine their causes of death, the circumstances, and to establish what reasonable precautions could have been taken. Their families have urged First Minister Humza Yousaf to take action to protect future at-risk inmates.In a statement outside court, the solicitor representing both families, Aamer Anwar, said they wanted Mr Yousaf to work to remove Crown immunity. Currently, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is exempt from prosecution for the deaths.Mr Anwar urged the first minister to set up an independent body to investigate prison deaths and impose a year's limit for the start of an FAI.He said the families believed the time it had taken to investigate the deaths had allowed the SPS to operate ""behind a veil of secrecy, covering up systemic failures and preventable suicides"". Katie Allan, a student at the University of Glasgow, took her own life in June 2018 at Polmont while serving a 16-month sentence for a hit-and-run crash.Ms Allan, who suffered from alopecia, had a history of self-harming which prison staff were aware of.She had previously been referred to a community mental health team by her GP.The inquiry heard Ms Allan was found to have traces of an antidepressant which was not prescribed to her during a post-mortem examination.At a family visit the day before she died, her mother had told prison officers Ms Allan was being ""berated"" by other prisoners and was ""terrified"". Four months later in October 2018, William Brown took his own life while he was on remand at the young offenders institution near Falkirk.Mr Brown, who had been in care repeatedly, died three days after being admitted as there was no space in a children's secure unit.The inquiry heard that he had walked into a police station with a knife while on bail for another blade offence.Despite a plea to bail him due to a lack of beds in a secure unit, Mr Brown was remanded to Polmont where he died in custody.Before he was taken there, Mr Brown was asked by a social worker if he was suicidal and he replied: ""No, not now, but I don't know how I'll be in prison.""Since 2016, he had been taken to hospital due to attempts on his life, suicidal ideation, excess drug use and fighting on 15 occasions in two years.He was initially put on a 30-minute observation at Polmont when he arrived ""for reassurance and safety"".On 5 October, Mr Brown was assessed as ""at no apparent risk of suicide"" and was removed from 30-minute observations.But less than two hours later he was referred to the mental health team by a social worker.He was found dead in his cell at 07:40 on 7 October - nearly 12 hours after last having contact with SPS staff. Their suicides followed a series of deaths in Scotland's prisons, which prompted a Scottish government review into how deaths in jail are handled.The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said Ms Allan and Mr Brown both died while in legal custody at Polmont.In 2022, the Crown Office told the families there was enough evidence to prosecute over their suicides but the SPS is immune from prosecution.Mr Anwar said Ms Allan's parents ""believe that the SPS has no accountability for the avoidable deaths of young people.""

She also called for Ms Black, the SNP's deputy leader at Westminster, to ""live up to her responsibilities or give the post over to someone who will"". Ms Black, who has been contacted for comment, made her ""comfortable"" remark on Times Radio last week. She said the culture of Westminster meant MPs lost touch with reality. Ms Black has already announced that she will be leaving Westminster at the next election and has previously described the House of Commons as an ""outdated, sexist and toxic"" working environment. The Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP cited safety concerns, social media abuse and unsociable hours as she explained her decision. She has also recently spoken to the BBC of her struggles with imposter syndrome, the term given for a psychological state where people doubt their skills and accomplishments and have a fear of being seen as a fraud. In the interview last week she went on to criticise colleagues in the House of Commons, who she said had settled too comfortably into life at Westminster. ""I've seen folk who you would have thoughts would have been the first one marching to the border with a claymore but now absolutely love being in London. I wouldn't have expected that,"" she told Times Radio. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland on Monday, Ms Cherry, said she believed the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn was doing a great job but criticised Ms Black's comments. ""When he made Mhairi his deputy he gave her a position of great responsibility, particularly in an election year when so many of her colleagues are facing difficult fights to hang on to their seats and I don't think it's appropriate for Mhairi to be attacking her colleagues in public,"" she said. ""She needs to live up to her responsibilities or give the post over to someone who will. ""And I am hoping that Mhairi will apologise to her colleagues this week."" Ms Cherry denied that she or her SNP colleagues were ""too comfortable at Westminster"" and defended their policy of sitting and voting in the House of Commons. ""The SNP is not an abstentionist party and if Mhairi wants to change that policy then she needs to put the work in to do it,"" she said. ""At the moment my constituents expect me to be present at Westminster and representing them there in relation to important issues such as the Post Office scandal."" And she defended her own record of working with MPs from other parties. ""It's not easy being an opposition member of parliament at Westminster but if you work and if you are present there and if you build alliances then you can achieve successes,"" she said. ""I've shown that in the past when I've built a cross-party alliance to stop Boris Johnson's unlawful prorogation of parliament and many of my SNP colleagues have had significant successes in relation to other issues ""But it's hard work doing that. It's not always terribly glamorous. It's easy to stand up and make a speech, it's much harder to work hard behind the scenes to create alliances to achieve reform and until independence comes we'll still have SNPs at Westminster and we're paid to do a job and be there and I believe in doing that,"" she added.

The music festival ran between 1994 and 2016, with the majority of events held at Balado airfield in Kinross. An account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with the name TITPofficial posted a message stating ""Guess who's back #TinthePark2026"".

The popular festival welcomed headline acts such as Oasis, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rihanna and Coldplay during its existence. However the 2017 edition was cancelled after a spate of problems with the 2016 event, where two gig-goers passed away amid reports of continual fighting and traffic problems.

Dean Ferguson fatally wounded Billy Joe Bates, 28, during a confrontation in Milton, Glasgow, on 18 November 2018. Mr Bates, who was described as Ferguson's second cousin, died in hospital four days after the attack. Detectives later discovered encrypted phone messages that linked Ferguson, 30, to the crime, including boasts of how he had left the country. Ferguson had been due to stand trial at the High Court in Glasgow for the murder of Mr Bates. But, via his lawyer Donald Findlay KC, he pleaded guilty in November to the reduced charge of culpable homicide. Judge Lord Clark, told him: ""You have expressed remorse for the tragic consequences of your actions. ""This was not premeditated - it was spontaneous in response to a fear of an assault."" The judge - who sentenced Ferguson to six years and four months in prison - added that he had taken account of the victim impact statement from Mr Bates' mother. He told him: ""She explained in her deeply moving words of the consequences this has had on the family. ""There is no sentence I can impose which will begin to relieve that grief."" Prosecutor John Keenan KC told an earlier hearing how the exact details of the incident ""cannot be determined"", but that there had been ""no history of animosity"" between the men. The court heard how the pair spent the morning of the attack together before going separate ways. Mr Keenan: ""They then came together around 2.30pm and a violent confrontation ensued. ""Ferguson sustained a head injury and Billy Joe Bates sustained a number of injuries including a fatal deep stab wound to the chest."" Ferguson was admitted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary around the same time as Mr Bates. He was initially identified as a ""potential suspect"" Detectives then began to trawl through CCTV to try and discover what happened. Footage showed Ferguson, the victim and another man going to a flat in the city's Maryhill early on 18 November. Ferguson had been described as ""angry and agitated"" while there. The men all left but Mr Bates came back to collect his phone and told a witness that he had ""fallen out"" with Ferguson. The men then all ended up at the flat in Milton where the killing occurred. Mr Keenan stated that neighbours recalled hearing ""raised male voices"" and one said there was a ""shout of pain or cry for help"". The man with Ferguson and Mr Bates made a 999 call at 14:33. Mr Bates was taken to hospital, but the court heard he was ""unable to state what had happened"". The stab wound was found to have punctured his right liver causing internal bleeding. He never recovered and died on 22 November 2018. While at the same hospital, Ferguson claimed his own injuries had occurred by falling on glass. He later discharged himself and, despite efforts to trace him, he was not found at that time. The French and Dutch law authorities later went on to smash the EncroChat phone network favoured by criminals. Encrypted messages linked to Ferguson were uncovered and helped identify him as the assailant. He had not previously been arrested due to a lack of evidence and his ""whereabouts unknown"" at the time. A request was made to the Dutch authorities and he was extradited on 4 May 2022. Mr Findlay told Monday's sentencing hearing: ""An incident occurred in which responsibility can be held at the door of each and tragic consequences followed. ""Clearly there was no long running feud - it was not something that needed to happen and should not have `happened.""",['Glasgow'],"['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1711/production/_104450950_billyjoebates.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13ED3/production/_130991618_pa-43522199.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

The metal cabinets are traditionally used to store broadband and phone cabling, but many are coming towards the end of their lifespans. The first converted cabinet will be installed in Scotland within weeks, under a pilot programme. BT hopes up to 60,000 could be converted, which would help tackle a shortfall in electric car chargers. The government's ambition is to increase the number of charging points from more than 50,000 today to 300,000 by 2030 but Zapmap figures show nearly a third of all UK charging points are currently in London. People have complained about the lack of charging ports in some areas and that some do not work or are unreliable. This pilot project by BT will explore how this solution could be scaled up to address the lack of chargers on UK roads, something that motoring groups have said is holding back Britain's electric car revolution. Both cabinets that are still providing broadband to individual households and those that have been decommissioned are able to be used to support the new EV charging points. Currently, the boxes contain old technology which will soon be defunct because of the nationwide rollout of full fibre broadband connections. Engineers will be able to retrofit the cabinets with a device that enables renewable energy to be shared to a charge point alongside the existing broadband service with no need to create a new connection, because they are already connected to a power source. The green lockers that are set to be decommissioned will have one charge point per cabinet, which provides two charging sockets. They also have a battery backup so existing broadband services should not be be disrupted during installation. As the boxes become decommissioned, more charging points can be added. The first location will be in East Lothian, with further pilots to roll out across the UK in the coming months. Tom Guy, CEO of Etc., the start-up and digital incubation arm at BT Group, said that this solution was a ""huge step"" in addressing the barriers customers face. ""Working closely with local councils in Scotland and more widely across the UK, we are at a critical stage of our journey in tackling a very real customer problem that sits at the heart of our wider purpose to connect for good,"" he said. Stuart Masson from automotive website The Car Expert welcomed the initiative. ""Harnessing existing street furniture is a great way to increase the number of public EV charging points without further adding to clutter along our footpaths,"" he said. ""Making this even more valuable, many of these green street cabinets are located in residential areas across the UK, including smaller villages and towns, where charging infrastructure is most severely lacking."" The Department for Transport told the BBC that they have committed ""hundreds of millions of pounds to expand local charging across England."" Their spokesperson said: ""The number of public charge points is rising across the country - increasing by 44% since December 2022.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67913795,"Oil and gas legislation is total distraction, senior Tory says","Plans to guarantee annual oil and gas licensing rounds are ""a total distraction"" which reinforce the idea the UK is ""not serious"" about tackling climate change, a senior Tory has said.",2024-01-08,"Plans to guarantee annual oil and gas licensing rounds are ""a total distraction"" which reinforce the idea the UK is ""not serious"" about tackling climate change, a senior Tory has said. Former minister Sir Alok Sharma said he would not vote for the upcoming Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill. It comes after ex-net zero tsar Chris Skidmore announced he was quitting as a Conservative MP over the legislation. The government says the plans will help strengthen the UK's energy security. It argues the country will still need to use some fossil fuels even after it reaches net zero, and that it is better for this to be produced domestically than imported. However, Sir Alok, who was president of the COP26 climate summit when it was hosted by the UK, said the bill was ""smoke and mirrors"" and ""frankly changes nothing"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the North Sea Transition Authority, which is responsible for issuing licenses, could already do so when it deemed necessary and that this would not change under the new legislation. ""What this bill does do is reinforce that unfortunate perception about the UK rowing back on climate action… and not being serious about meeting our international commitments,"" he said. Sir Alok criticised the government for ""doubling down on granting more oil and gas production licenses"", arguing the time devoted to the bill would be better spent ""pushing forward on plans for a clean energy transition"". He added that the price of oil and gas was set internationally so the plans would not necessarily lower domestic energy bills, while the government could not control whether private companies sold their oil abroad or in the UK. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of 30 MPs, including Mr Skidmore and Conservative peer Lord Goldsmith, have written to Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho urging her to drop the legislation. In their letter, the group said the plans weakened the UK's claim to be a world leader in tackling climate change. ""The most effective way to bolster the UK's energy security is by increasing the supply of low-cost renewables and implementing energy efficiency measures, both of which would genuinely lower consumer bills,"" they wrote. MPs had been due to vote on the legislation in Parliament for the first time on Monday, but the bill was delayed after several debates overran. The Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill is due to return to the House of Commons in the next two weeks. Labour, which has said it would not allow any new oil or gas licenses if it wins power, opposes the plans. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government was ""wasting its time trying to pass legislation to create a dividing line with the Labour Party"" and that it would not make any difference to energy bills. On Friday, Mr Skidmore, who led a government review of net zero, said he could not continue as a Tory MP ahead of the vote. He said the bill would send a ""global signal that the UK is rowing ever further back from its climate commitments"" and in effect allow more frequent new oil and gas licenses. Mr Skidmore has now formally submitted his resignation as an MP, triggering a by-election in his Kingswood constituency. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: ""It makes sense to make the most of our domestic supply, rather than shipping in liquefied natural gas with four times the emissions than domestically produced gas. ""These new licenses will not increase carbon emissions above our legally binding carbon budgets, but will provide certainty for industry, support 200,000 jobs and bring in tens of billions of tax that we can invest in the green transition and support people with cost of living."" Last year Rishi Sunak pushed back some of the UK's climate policies, saying he did not want to impose unnecessary extra costs on the public. However, the prime minister said he was still committed to achieving net zero by 2050, which means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere.","['Oil & Gas industry', 'North Sea oil and gas', 'Alok Sharma']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7C5A/production/_132243813_b34ffe6c1d4797d53277e2ffa2f1d0c219eb285d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3EC0/production/_129346061_gettyimages-1148474010.jpg']",['Becky Morton'],UK,Scotland

More than 700 sub-postmasters were accused of wrongdoing based on information from a faulty computer system. The charges included false accounting, theft and fraud. Some of those convicted were jailed, while others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Others have since died. The scandal took place between 1999 and 2015. Although it has been public knowledge for years with an inquiry ongoing, the recent ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) wrote to 73 potential victims in Scotland in 2020 but only 16 have come forward to have their convictions quashed. Six people were then given permission by the SCCRC to appeal Horizon convictions in court but only two have been overturned so far. The other four are still awaiting an outcome. The first minister was asked about potential legal moves after the Conservative MP Sir David Davis said there was no reason why a ""mass appeal"" could not take place. Mr Yousaf said: ""It should not have taken a television drama to get the government to take action. ""The Scottish National Party has been asking for action in relation to Horizon and the injustices done to postmasters and sub-postmasters for many years. ""I think the idea of almost a mass exoneration is one that is very worthy of consideration."" The first minister also said there were ""serious questions"" for those involved, especially Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who was postal affairs minister in the coalition government. Sir Ed has said he was ""deeply misled by Post Office executives"". UK ministers met on Monday to consider ways of clearing the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters. Myra Philp's late mother, Mary, was among those accused of wrongdoing while she worked at the post office in Auchtermuchty in Fife in 2001. And Ms Philp admitted the ITV drama on the scandal reduced her to tears. She told BBC Scotland News: ""I think the people who were not convicted were put in a virtual jail cell for the rest of their days. ""If you think about it they were not even given their day in court to even try and defend themselves.""

Their families have urged First Minister Humza Yousaf to take action to protect future at-risk inmates.In a statement outside court, the solicitor representing both families, Aamer Anwar, said they wanted Mr Yousaf to work to remove Crown immunity. Currently, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is exempt from prosecution for the deaths.Mr Anwar urged the first minister to set up an independent body to investigate prison deaths and impose a year's limit for the start of an FAI.He said the families believed the time it had taken to investigate the deaths had allowed the SPS to operate ""behind a veil of secrecy, covering up systemic failures and preventable suicides"". Katie Allan, a student at the University of Glasgow, took her own life in June 2018 at Polmont while serving a 16-month sentence for a hit-and-run crash.Ms Allan, who suffered from alopecia, had a history of self-harming which prison staff were aware of.She had previously been referred to a community mental health team by her GP.The inquiry heard Ms Allan was found to have traces of an antidepressant which was not prescribed to her during a post-mortem examination.At a family visit the day before she died, her mother had told prison officers Ms Allan was being ""berated"" by other prisoners and was ""terrified"". Four months later in October 2018, William Brown took his own life while he was on remand at the young offenders institution near Falkirk.Mr Brown, who had been in care repeatedly, died three days after being admitted as there was no space in a children's secure unit.The inquiry heard that he had walked into a police station with a knife while on bail for another blade offence.Despite a plea to bail him due to a lack of beds in a secure unit, Mr Brown was remanded to Polmont where he died in custody.Before he was taken there, Mr Brown was asked by a social worker if he was suicidal and he replied: ""No, not now, but I don't know how I'll be in prison.""Since 2016, he had been taken to hospital due to attempts on his life, suicidal ideation, excess drug use and fighting on 15 occasions in two years.He was initially put on a 30-minute observation at Polmont when he arrived ""for reassurance and safety"".On 5 October, Mr Brown was assessed as ""at no apparent risk of suicide"" and was removed from 30-minute observations.But less than two hours later he was referred to the mental health team by a social worker.He was found dead in his cell at 07:40 on 7 October - nearly 12 hours after last having contact with SPS staff. Their suicides followed a series of deaths in Scotland's prisons, which prompted a Scottish government review into how deaths in jail are handled.The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said Ms Allan and Mr Brown both died while in legal custody at Polmont.In 2022, the Crown Office told the families there was enough evidence to prosecute over their suicides but the SPS is immune from prosecution.Mr Anwar said Ms Allan's parents ""believe that the SPS has no accountability for the avoidable deaths of young people."" Speaking on behalf of John Reilly, William's brother, Mr Anwar said: ""Polmont had a duty of care towards William and it was simply not observed. ""If it had been, then his brother would not be dead.""He added: “It seemed to him that Polmont could not afford to keep William alive, which is a horrible and distressing thought."" An inquiry for deaths occurring in custody is mandatory but a joint FAI is rare.Unlike criminal proceedings, FAIs are used to establish facts rather than to apportion blame.Mr Anwar said the families also want the first minister to ensure families get automatic legal representation at an FAI.He said: ""The first minister Humza Yousaf must not betray the many promises he made to these families whilst justice minister, he cannot escape behind a veil of silence because there is now an FAI.""A SPS spokesperson said: “The loss of any person in our care is devastating and we recognise the profound impact it has on an individual’s loved ones.“The health and wellbeing of those in our care is a key priority and everyone who enters custody is assessed by both our staff and NHS partners to identify what support is needed.""They added that it would be inappropriate to comment further.","['Polmont', 'Prisons', 'UK prisons', 'Suicide prevention']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/d162/live/46dab020-ad75-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2082/live/2ac07960-ad75-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/6cbb/live/9774cd10-ae13-11ee-8f07-bbfdfa890097.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/5a11/live/bfecde40-ad73-11ee-bc2f-cb5579b90709.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Scotland

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67910944,Energy firms allowed to restart force-fitting prepayment meters,Energy companies have been granted approval to resume force-fitting prepayment meters in people's homes nearly a year after it was suspended.,2024-01-08,"Energy companies have been granted approval to resume force-fitting prepayment meters in people's homes nearly a year after it was suspended. EDF, Octopus and Scottish Power can install the meters again after meeting various requirements set by Ofgem, the industry regulator. For years, energy companies were able to force-fit meters into homes when bills went unpaid. But agents for British Gas were exposed installing them inappropriately. They were forcing their way into the homes of vulnerable people, against Ofgem rules. The scandal emerged early last year after an investigation by the Times newspaper and led to a public outcry. The meters were fitted (or smart meters automatically switched to prepay mode) when people did not pay previous bills, and there was no prospect of payment. It was designed to avoid further debts building up because these meters require gas and electricity to be paid for upfront. Since February last year, no forced installation of meters have been allowed. Ofgem has since drawn up new rules that set out what suppliers are required to do. Under the rules, meters should not be fitted: Any company that breaks the rules would face enforcement action and unlimited fines. They would also be required to refit a standard meter within 24 hours and pay compensation. ""Protecting consumers is our number one priority,"" said Tim Jarvis, director general for markets at Ofgem. ""We've made clear that suppliers must exhaust all other options before considering forced installation of a prepayment meter, and consumers can help themselves by reaching out to their supplier as soon as possible if they think they won't be able to pay their bill, so payment options can be discussed. ""While nobody wants to see the practices uncovered last year repeated, we also know that allowing households to build up unsustainable amounts of debt isn't the right thing to do either."" Campaigners want a total ban on the force-fitting of prepayment meters. Such a ban would need to be introduced by government ministers. Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: ""It is outrageous that energy firms are seeking to use the courts to force people onto prepayment meters in the middle of winter. ""We still have grave concerns about the processes energy firms have in place for assessing vulnerabilities."" The inclusion of Scottish Power on the new list of approvals comes after the firm was granted the first new batch of 124 warrants to fit the meters at Berkshire Magistrates Court, sitting in Reading, in October. But Scottish Power later cancelled a few of the warrants when it emerged that mothers of children under two were among those subject to the warrants, with one mum having given birth just a few weeks before, according to an investigation by the Times in November. A further hearing has been held since but in any case, even if warrants are granted, they cannot be acted upon until Ofgem give final approval. Scottish Power, EDF and Octopus have now been given that status. Octopus said, despite the permission, it had no plans to start again. ""Even before the ban, Octopus had only ever carried out involuntary installations in extremely rare circumstances - indeed, we've only carried out 32 such installations, ever. In every case, customers had not paid anything for at least six months, and had refused to respond to at least 40 communications,"" a spokesman for the company said. ""As such, we currently have no plans to restart involuntary installations of prepayment meters."" A Scottish Power spokesman said: ""While we have met Ofgem's strict criteria and been authorised to restart involuntary prepayment meter installations, where appropriate, this is always a last resort. Our focus will continue to be on supporting our customers to manage their debt and avoid the need for such action."" EDF said it was important to resume under strict supervision from the regulator. ""We have a duty to keep bills as low as possible, especially given customers are struggling, and rising debt levels are leading to all households facing bigger bills,"" a spokesman for the company said. Ofgem is proposing lifting the energy price cap by £16 for a household with typical gas and electricity usage between April and March 2025, to cover unpaid debt levels among energy customers which has risen to £2.9bn.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-67907644,How the Horizon Post Office scandal has affected Scotland,The Post Office Horizon scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history.,2024-01-08,"The Post Office Horizon scandal has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. People running post offices were accused of crimes like theft, false accounting or embezzlement on the basis of a faulty IT system called Horizon. Some were convicted and sent to prison, others lost their livelihoods and reputations. Their plight has been highlighted in a new ITV drama called Mr Bates vs The Post Office. We don't know the exact number. In Scotland the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service holds sole responsibility for prosecutions. That's different to England where the Post Office prosecuted cases. In 2020 the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - which investigates possible miscarriages of justice - wrote to 73 potential victims of the Horizon scandal in Scotland. As of December 2023 only 16 people had come forward in Scotland to ask for their convictions to be reviewed. That number may rise in the coming days and weeks given the renewed publicity around the Horizon scandal. In November 2022 the SCCRC gave six people permission to appeal Horizon convictions in court. Of those initial six cases only two convictions have so far been overturned. The other four are still waiting for an outcome. In the UK as a whole 93 convictions have been quashed. It is possible there are hundreds of people across Scotland who were accused of stealing money from their post office branches who weren't convicted. A UK-wide public inquiry into the scandal is ongoing and in 2022 it came to Glasgow to hear evidence from affected sub-postmasters and mistresses in Scotland. None of those giving evidence had been convicted but they described the desperation they felt when their accounts repeatedly showed shortfalls. They talked about the dire impact being accused of stealing had on their reputations, finances and mental health. Some people who were accused but not convicted have received compensation: others are still waiting. We know that some sub-postmasters and mistresses died before the extent of the Horizon scandal was uncovered. People whose Horizon convictions are overturned are entitled to apply for £600,000 compensation. In a letter to the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board in October 2023 the Crown Office said Scotland was ""very much closer to the start of its journey"" in addressing potential miscarriages of justice related to Horizon compared to other parts of the UK. The next court hearing in Scotland is on Friday. It is possible two more convictions will be overturned then because the Crown Office has indicated it won't oppose two of the cases. Once the initial six appeals have concluded the Crown Office said it anticipated that ""a streamlined and expedient process of review, appeal and disposal""  will be available for future cases.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67912939,NHS: GP says private care can help cut waiting lists,"The private sector can help ease the pressure on the NHS, a GP has said.",2024-01-08,"The private sector can help ease the pressure on the NHS, a GP has said. Dr Beth Howells recently opened a private GP's surgery on the Ceredigion/Carmarthenshire border after working in the NHS for nearly 20 years. She believes there will be an expansion of private primary healthcare providers in Wales at a time when GP services are under pressure. The Welsh government said it was up to individuals if they wanted to use private health care instead of the NHS. Last year, Dr Howells returned her NHS contract and opened her own surgery in Newcastle Emlyn. Dr Howells said people opted to pay for a private GP as they felt they could not wait two or three weeks for a GP appointment at their NHS practice. She believes that her role as a private GP will take some of the pressure off the NHS, at a time when GP services are in the headlines. Figures from the British Medical Association (BMA) show that the number of patients per full time equivalent GP in Wales have gone up from 1,676 in 2013 to 2,210 in 2022. ""It's difficult to predict the future and how things will evolve and where the demand will be,"" said Dr Howells. ""But I personally think it's impossible for the NHS to provide everything to everybody. ""The population has expanded enormously, people are living longer due to good health care, which means that there will be a role for additional services which the NHS will not be in a position to offer."" BMA Wales said doctors leaving the NHS for the private sector was ""a symptom of... the impact of chronic underinvestment in general practice over a number of years"". It added: ""Welsh government must commit to a reversal of this underfunding and restore NHS general practice to its place as the foundation of a high-quality, cost-effective health system."" The Welsh government said it had provided financial incentives to attract GP trainees to speciality training schemes in mid, north and west Wales, ""areas which, historically, have been difficult to recruit for"". After more than 32 years in the NHS, nurse Neris Davies has decided to move to the private sector due to the pressure. Ms Davies said she dreaded going to work while in the NHS as she felt she was constantly playing catch-up with her work. ""People would come in quite irate because you were behind time and, as a nurse, I wanted to give patients the time that they needed. ""So going home was also frustrating because you felt that you haven't given your best and it's hard to switch off from that. Since changing surgeries last year, she said she felt happier coming to work and feels the pressures are not the same. On the streets of Newcastle Emlyn, people were both interested and reluctant in paying for a GP service. Alex Baker, 24, said: ""If it was life or death and you can't get to A&E and there's a GP you have to see. But if it's for something that isn't major, then no.""But Iris Rush, 76, added: ""If you need to see them, then you do what you have to. So if I had to pay, I'd have to pay.""Oliver Evans, 31, believes more needs to be done to improve access to NHS GPs. ""If it comes to it, everybody will have to pay for private healthcare and that's why we have to protect the NHS,"" he said. ""If everyone had the money, they would go and do it. But at the end of the day, the NHS is what makes this country Great Britain, to a certain extent, it's one of our greatest achievements. ""It's a necessity to have your healthcare. So if it's pushed in that direction, us as a working class won't have a choice, will we,"" he said. The Welsh government said it wanted people ""to be able to access GP services on the NHS in Wales as quickly as possible, based on need"" but it was up to individuals if they wanted to go private instead.","['General practitioners (GPs)', 'Health', 'NHS Wales', 'Newcastle Emlyn', 'Wales']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F297/production/_132230126_drbethhowells.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1765A/production/_132243859_nerisdavies.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4EA7/production/_132253102_oliverevans.jpg']",['Dafydd Morgan'],UK,Wales

The mother of Christopher Kapessa said the family had been subjected to years of racial abuse since moving to Wales. She added that the family received hate mail and had their home in Rhondda Cynon Taf daubed in racist graffiti. Christopher, 13, died after being pushed into the river Cynon in 2019. The High Court in 2022 upheld the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision not to charge a 14-year-old boy who allegedly caused the teenager's death. Christopher's mother, Alina Joseph, told the inquest the family lived in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, until 2018 and suffered ""horrific treatment"" and ""felt very isolated"". She said they received ""racial hate letters"" and racist language had been written on the outside their home. The court in Pontypridd heard of incidents over a number of years where she said her children were allegedly beaten, urinated on and run over. She said they were reported to police but no action was taken. Ms Joseph's statement described her son as her ""treasure"" and said she would ""fight for justice for him"". She said Christopher ""wasn't a confident swimmer"" but had done ""basic swimming lessons"". The inquest heard from a teenage boy at a river on the day Christopher died, who described the ""panic"" as a group of friends realised he could not swim. The 17 year-old - who cannot be named because of his age - said he had joined friends at the river, at which time ""10-plus"" people were there, including Christopher. The plans to meet at the river had been made on social media, he added. He said that at the time he did not know whether Christopher could swim and did not jump into the river because he ""didn't want to get into the dirty water"". Asked about the moment Christopher was pushed into the water, the teenager said: ""Everybody didn't know if he could swim or not, there was no immediate panic. ""As soon as everyone realised he couldn't swim, they was panicking, people jumped in to try and help."" Asked what Christopher was doing in the water, he said: ""He was flailing, trying to keep himself above the water, struggling."" Asked whether there had been any barriers or fencing preventing them from accessing the bridge, the teenager said it was ""out in the open"". He added that it appeared to be ""out of use"", however, and the murky water underneath meant it was not possible to see the bottom of the river. The inquest heard that in a police interview following the incident, the teenager had said that he may have heard the boy who pushed Christopher jokingly tell him moments before: ""I'll chuck you in now."" Asked how certain he was of what he had heard, however, the teenager said he didn't remember, although he had ""clearly"" seen the push itself. The teenager explained how he then got on his bike and went to the nearest hospital to try to find help. The barrister representing the boy who allegedly pushed Christopher into the water, David Hughes, told the court that his client was one of the first to jump into the water to try and help. Questioning the teenage witness, Mr Hughes said they didn't accept that a push happened and suggested that his client had slipped into Christopher. The teenager said that was possible but added: ""My thoughts are it was a push which wasn't meant with any malice but it was more playful."" The court heard that Christopher would have turned 18 two days ago, on 6 January. The CPS had decided not to bring a charge as it claimed he pushed Christopher as a ""foolish prank"". Christopher's family accused the CPS and South Wales Police of institutional racism for not prosecuting the suspect. When the decision not to charge the 14-year-old was reviewed, Jenny Hopkins, who oversees the appeals and review unit within the CPS, said: ""Although there was evidence to support a prosecution for manslaughter it was not in the public interest to prosecute."" The inquest is expected to last for up to two weeks.","['Hirwaun', 'Wales', 'Mountain Ash']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/A661/production/_108039524_ecb9fdb0-6fd0-4a06-92f1-2d8684f65255.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1370/production/_118767940_alina.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Wales
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67910675,20mph: Drakeford says confused drivers will not face 20mph fine,"People who are ""genuinely confused"" about the 20mph speed limit will not be prosecuted, Mark Drakeford has said.",2024-01-08,"People who are ""genuinely confused"" about the 20mph speed limit will not be prosecuted, Mark Drakeford has said. The outgoing first minister spoke as enforcement of the policy in built-up areas in Wales began on Monday. He said police will enforce Wales' 20mph law when people drive ""well above"" the speed limit. But he said he did not think those who were puzzled about whether a limit applied to the road they were travelling on would face action. In a press conference Mr Drakeford also admitted there have been ""anomalies"" in signage. His transport minister Lee Waters said on Monday that ""for now"" prosecutions will start at 26mph in a 20mph zone. The limit came into effect in September. Mr Drakeford said police in the first instance would ""make sure people are aware of the law [and] their obligations"". ""Where people deliberately break the law, where people drive well above 20mph in a 20mph zone, then the law will have to be enforced."" He added: ""I think if the police find somebody driving above 20mph and the reason is they are genuinely confused about that - I don't think in those circumstances of genuine confusion the police will move to enforcement. ""If there are examples, genuine examples, where people just have misunderstood that this piece of road that they are on is now a 20mph limit, I think that will be resolved through the way that the police intend to respond. ""But it would need to be genuine confusion, rather than just a claim to be confused."" He said suggested there are ""anomalies"" in the implementation of the law. ""We recognised that from the beginning,"" he said. ""Some of them are to do with signage, and whether the signage is clear enough."" The two candidates to be the next Welsh Labour leader have said they would launch a review of the law if elected - and Mr Drakeford said that had been committed to by the Welsh government from the beginning. He added: ""In Wales, people do observe the law. They may not have learned to love it… but they are abiding by it."" Mr Waters wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""after giving over three months to get used to it the police are starting to enforce"". Mr Waters, the deputy climate change minister, described the police approach to enforcement as ""education led"", adding that ""there's no incentive for us to fine because the money won't stay in Wales"". A Welsh government spokesperson clarified that the money generated by 20mph speeding fines, ""as with all speeding fines, is directed to HM Treasury"". Mr Waters, who has transport in his portfolio, also wrote: ""Police guidelines say enforcement will be targeted on drivers travelling 10% above the speed limit - plus 2mph. ""For now this will be increased to 10% plus 4mph meaning we start to prosecute at 26mph in a 20mph limit."" He also said a review is looking at ""how the limit is being implemented"" and ""whether local authorities are confident in using their powers to exempt some stretches of road that would be better at 30mph"". In introducing the law, Welsh ministers argued the limit would reduce deaths and noise and encourage people to walk or cycle. A petition to axe the new default limit has gained just under 470,000 signatures since it was launched in September, the most in the Senedd's history. Organisers of the campaign called on the Welsh government to ""rescind and remove"" the ""disastrous"" law. The Senedd Petitions Committee is due to consider the topic for debate as the petition has received well over the 10,000 signature threshold. As of Monday morning, the number of signatures was above 467,000. Welsh Conservatives said they were in favour of a 20mph limit outside schools, hospitals and care homes - but called the rollout ""disastrous, frankly ludicrous and a war on motorists"". South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael said ""common sense will be applied"". ""It's not as if there's a will to make life difficult for drivers,"" he said. Mr Michael told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that people who did not want it needed to recognise it was now law, and use their common sense in the way they drive. ""This is now the law, let's make it work,"" Mr Michael said. He stressed the police wanted to engage the public, rather than spend all their time on enforcement. ""This is a speed limit that was introduced by Welsh government because of the strong evidence that it would save lives and reduce injuries,"" Mr Michael said. He acknowledged that there were complications with the introduction of the law and said it was sensible that there would be a review of the implementation. ""I think there are issues in some places where there's a lot of switching between different speed limits,"" he said. Drivers have also complained of unclear road signage. ""All of that will work through in time,"" Mr Michael said. He also pointed out that road safety changes have frequently been unpopular in the past. ""Every law that's been brought in order to improve safety on the roads - whether you go back to motorcycle helmets, whether you look at seatbelts - has had a degree of controversy at the beginning, before people get used to it,"" Mr Michael said.","['Welsh government', 'Wales']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/44E5/production/_125873671_sign.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EBF0/production/_130700406_5f444507-e0ac-4c8e-bf9d-26a9f37c3ba4.jpg']","['David Deans', 'Antonia Matthews']",UK,Wales

Leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said a law passed in the Commons was needed to address ""Wales' underfunding"". The Member of the Senedd for Ynys Mon will set out his economic ideas in a speech in Cardiff on Tuesday. He will say Plaid wants the Welsh government to be given powers to introduce new tax bands. Plaid Cymru would need the help of a larger party to make its Economic Fairness Bill a reality in the Commons. The party has not given full details on how it would work, but said it would ""rebalance the wealth of the UK, ensuring that Wales gets what it's owed and critically what it needs in public investment"". In his speech, Mr ap Iorwerth will say: ""Between 2001 and 2029 - the Welsh government estimates that Wales will have lost out to the tune of between £2.9bn and £8bn of rail investment alone. ""It further calculates that the Levelling Up Fund and Shared Prosperity Fund leaves us over £1bn worse off. ""These are significant numbers. And losing that kind of investment makes a big difference."" There are long-standing complaints that Wales should have received billions as a result of the HS2 railway line, which was classed as English and Wales despite ending in Birmingham. The UK government provides most of the cash needed to run Welsh government services and invest in infrastructure, with a smaller proportion raised from tax. The amount is determined by the Barnett formula. Plaid argues that Wales' funding should be based on its needs. A recent report by the Welsh government's chief economist said public spending per head in Wales was lower than Scotland or Northern Ireland, but higher than England overall and most English regions. In his speech, Mr ap Iorwerth, who became party leader last summer after the resignation of Adam Price, will also set out proposals for new economic targets, and seeking support for the Senedd to have more flexibility over taxation. This could include the right to set new tax bands, which the Scottish government is already able to do. New tax powers would also have to be passed in Westminster. Currently the Welsh government is only able to amend income tax rates - a power it has never used. Mr ap Iorwerth will tell the Wales Governance Centre on Monday evening that Wales has a ""persistent underperformance"" that needs to be addressed. ""Creating a fair society should be an ambition for all of us, collectively,"" he will say.

They were told he had a ""bright future ahead of him as a boxer"" and that ""his eyes were fixed on boxing and nothing else"". There were flowers arranged as a pair of boxing gloves and others spelling out the word ""champ"" in the hearse.

Corrine Brown, 33, was left with a collapsed lung after the attack but Darren Brown, 35, told Cardiff Crown Court it was ""a blur"". She was said to have been comforting their 18-month-old daughter when the assault happened. Mr Brown denies attempted murder at the couple's home in Wildmill, Bridgend, on 10 July last year. He previously pleaded guilty to a charge of wounding with intent. Giving evidence Mr Brown, who sat on Bridgend council as an independent until his resignation last September, accepted he had stabbed his wife. But he said he picked up a knife from the kitchen and went upstairs to ""try and frighten her"". He repeatedly denied remembering stabbing his wife in their child's bedroom and in the bathroom. On accepting he had intended to cause his wife serious bodily harm Mr Brown became emotional. ""I was confused, I couldn't believe I could do such a thing,"" he said. He told Kevin Seal, defending, he neither intended to murder or kill his wife. The same month as the attack the couple had agreed to split after 10 years of marriage but decided to remain living together until the mortgage was paid. Ms Brown had recently begun seeing another man. The court heard Mr Brown had placed a voice-activated camera in his wife's bedroom. She knew it was in the room, he said, but not where it was. ""I was paranoid I would come home and she and the children would be gone,"" Mr Brown said. When cross examined by James Wilson, prosecuting, Mr Brown said of the attack: ""It's a blur. ""I just wanted to hurt her. I didn't want to kill her."" Asked by the judge why he hadn't said before he could not remember the attack, Mr Brown said he did not know. He added through tears: ""She's the mother of my children. I'm ashamed."" Earlier the jury were shown blood-spatter photos of the toddler's bedroom, landing and bathroom. Expert witness Martin Beale told the jury the images were consistent with Ms Brown being at these locations while injured and bleeding. He said there were signs  of a possible attempt to clean up the blood stains. Forensic physician Prof Jason Payne-Jones confirmed Ms Brown was stabbed three times in the back and suffered a collapsed lung on the left. Each injury, the court heard, was 2.5cm (1in) wide. Prof Payne-Jones added in order to cause a collapsed lung on average a weapon must penetrate the chest by at least 3-4cm. Showing the jury the 18cm blade used in the attack he said the depth of the stab wound was about 6cm. The court heard the blows came from from the side or back. Ms Brown's hands, Prof Payne-Jones said, showed injuries typical of defensive wounds. It would be, he said difficult to inflict these oneself. Previously Mr Wilson told the jury Mr Brown told police his wife's wounds were self-inflicted. The case continues.","['Wales', 'Bridgend']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/CAEB/production/_131474915_mediaitem131474914.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13D83/production/_129438218_ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg.jpg']",['N/A'],UK,Wales

Foster Wales, the network representing fostering teams, said there were more than 7,000 children in the care system, but only 3,800 foster families. The group said it wanted to tackle ""misconceptions"" to reach a target of recruiting 800 foster households over the next two years. The Welsh government said it was committed to increasing the number. Emma and Joanna Johnston from Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire, started fostering last January. Joanna has older children from a previous relationship and the couple knew they wanted a family together. ""I moved down to Wales from England to be with Jo around six years ago, and I'd always wanted children in some capacity,"" said Emma. ""Jo has her own biological children who've grown up and fostering was the natural thing for us to do. ""It's something that I've always wanted to do. I didn't necessarily want biological children of my own and I wanted to help children who were in need."" Emma and Jo, who are both teachers, said the experience could be challenging but ""hugely rewarding."" Jo said: ""You do worry if the child is going to settle. But you're so keen to help them. ""We've been on loads of different adventures in the fresh air, to see what she likes. It was so great to see her enjoying and showing her parts of Wales she hadn't seen before. ""She's integrated into the family really well."" Jo said they wanted to give back to children who needed support. ""We've worked in different roles with children and young people for the past 20 years, and we wanted to give back to children who needed help and support. We want to try and help those children overcome what they've been through in the past."" The couple have both gone part-time in their work, but said every situation was different. Emma said: ""There isn't a set plan that works for everyone, it depends on your own circumstances and the children that are placed with you. ""It's more than possible to work full-time but it depends on the individual circumstances."" Figures from Foster Wales showed 53% of young people in care were aged 11 or over. The organisation said it wanted to encourage people to consider fostering a teenager. Jo and Emma have fostered a 12-year-old girl and Jo said there were ""so many misconceptions that need to be addressed"". ""You can help them by talking to them about how they're feeling,"" Jo said. ""You can do things together and find common hobbies, whereas with a younger child you might not be able to do those things."" Foster Wales agreed there were key ""misconceptions"" stopping potential carers from wanting to foster, including a lack of confidence and ability to support a child in care, the belief that fostering does not fit with certain lifestyles and the misconceptions around the criteria to become a carer. The head of the Foster Wales network, Alastair Cope, said everybody could bring something to the table through local authority fostering, adding: ""I think it's about providing that love and that stability in the interim."" He said the key aspects were providing love and a ""stable home life"" before they may go back to live with birth families or move on to a longer-term foster family. Mr Cope said a change in Welsh government policy meant there was a need to increase the number of people registered as local authority foster carers. ""There are agencies that operate on a profit-making basis out there at the moment,"" he said. ""Welsh government have committed to by 2027, removing profit from anything around children's services, and obviously that includes fostering."" Mr Cope said by that point there needed to be more foster carers able to accept children. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to increasing the number of foster carers in Wales. ""We are working closely with our national fostering scheme, Foster Wales, to help local authorities ensure that there is a readily available supply of dedicated, trained, diverse and well-supported foster carers who can provide a stable and caring family environment locally for our children and young people.""","['Welsh government', 'Children', 'Wales', 'Foster care', 'Cross Hands']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F641/production/_132214036_fostering_getty_skate_boy.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8111/production/_132214033_foster1-emma-jo.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175A5/production/_101535659_teens_sofa_texting_getty.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/109DD/production/_127816086_iplayer_header_grey_8-1x.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/E2CD/production/_127816085_iplayer_footer-1920x38-1x.jpg']","['Aimee Thomas', 'Megan Davies']",UK,Wales

Kate Brunner KC's independent review made 31 recommendations in total. Her report found the overall response was ""largely successful"". But she said it was ""no surprise that there were areas of weakness"", given managing a pandemic was a ""novel experience"" for the government. The review covered the period from December 2019 up to the removal of restrictions in April 2022, and looked at areas including border closures, quarantine procedures and online learning. The document said a mass vaccination plan should now be drawn up and consideration given to how testing capacity could be increased rapidly in the event of another pandemic. Ms Brunner called for a review of the island's emergency powers legislation to preserve a distinction between law and guidance, and a clear plan for publishing any new legislation with date stamping. In relation to those powers, her report recommended the government refund the charges imposed on returning residents quarantined at the Comis Hotel and ""acknowledge that they went through a very difficult experience, which was for the good of the island"". The report also recommended the development and funding of a Covid recovery strategy for children affected, including educational support, a long Covid treatment programme and a reduction in  waiting times for mental health appointments. Other recommendations included: Ms Brunner said the pandemic had ""provided great challenges"" for the government, businesses, and the public, and ""high levels of anxiety were prevalent for everyone"". The pandemic was a ""terrible time for many people"" on the island and ""lives were lost and many people suffered"", she said. There had been ""many unknown factors and uncertainties"" at the outset and the government ""needed to grapple with complex and unfamiliar issues and decisions to protect residents and the economy"", she continued. ""Outcomes were comparatively good in terms of numbers of deaths, time in lockdown, costs per head and economic recovery,"" Ms Brunner said. ""The island fared much better than many other places."" Ms Brunner said she had had full cooperation from the current government and ""all significant officials, advisers and politicians"" who had left their posts, and had not been ""prevented from obtaining any evidence which I sought"".

Sir William Hillary founded the charity after being inspired to take action after witnessing several shipwrecks of the Manx coast while living in Douglas. A service at St George's Church, where he was buried in 1847, marked the start of the charity's 200th anniversary. RNLI chief executive Mark Dowie said the island would ""always have that very special place"" in its history. Mr Dowie said the island remained a ""critical element"" of the service and Sir William ""would recognise today the service that he intended to create in 1824"". He said: ""We've come on an awfully long way obviously in terms of technology and the way we do things, but essentially the service is the same and that is an amazing achievement within 200 years."" The church service featured hymns and readings, including the Lifeboat Prayer, which was read by representatives of the island's five lifeboat stations, followed by a wreath laying at Sir William's tomb. The service was organised by volunteer Emily Heaton, who passed out as Douglas lifeboat station's first female coxswain on an all-weather lifeboat late last year. She said to be the first female to take on the position at the founding station was ""truly quite special"". ""To be doing it in the same waters is that really special link to the birthplace of the RNLI,"" she added. The event was part of a series of events to mark the anniversary on the island, which will continue in with a year-long exhibition at the House of Manannan, which is due to be opened in February. Chairman of the island's 200th panel Allan Corlett said the commemorations were designed to ""inspire future generations to involve themselves with the RNLI"".

People without local residential qualifications can live in open market properties. The Environment and Infrastructure Committee (E&I) is creating new criteria for adding properties. Former Deputy Chief Minister Mark Helyar said he was ""slightly concerned"" at the decision. E&I has the power to add any local market property to the open market register. Its President Lindsay de Sausmarez said her committee was still working on the new criteria. Deputy Helyar asked E&I a number of questions, which it responded to explaining the committee's position. He said: ""There is a great deal of speculation about this issue. ""As far as I'm concerned, the response doesn't correspond with Guernsey law, but lawyers of course often disagree. ""I'm slightly concerned that the decision to unilaterally suspend legal rights appear to have been made purely it seems on a small group of politicians personal dislike of local residents making a profit, it does, however, seem to chime with other socialist anti-profit policies such as GP11."" GP11 is a policy which requires all planning applications for more than 20 units of accommodation to provide up to 30% of developable land for affordable housing purposes. Deputy de Sausmarez said it was ""incredibly important"" a new policy was developed, so the open and local markets could be protected. She added: ""The committee - like all States members - is mandated to act in the best interests of the island, and protecting the housing market from the risk of instability is inarguably in the best interests of the island, especially right now when housing is rightly such a priority. ""I'm sure, as the political lead for the Treasury until just a few weeks ago, Deputy Helyar would be strongly supportive of any additional revenue that can be raised fairly and effectively. ""The new policy will include a levy on what is an entirely voluntary process which, even after any such levy, would likely result in a meaningful profit for the successful applicant."" She said it was the right thing to do to suspend new applications to the open market. Mrs de Sausmarez added: ""We need a policy in place to define what is an open market property and what qualifies as that part of our market has a really important role. ""It is there to make sure the local market remains as affordable as possible for local residents. It's also an economic enabler."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

Alan Witney-Price, boss of Sark Electricity Limited (SEL), said the scheme would lead to higher power prices than those charged by his company. The government has been presented with plans for a new grid at a cost of £8.6m, which would include a 30m (98ft) wind turbine and a solar farm. Sark's Policy and Finance Committee (P&F) has been contacted for a response. An independent report in 2021 stated Sark's current electricity infrastructure needed a ""complete overhaul"" because of what it described as ""serious health and safety concerns"". Mr Witney-Price said he is willing to improve it, but requires the permission of the island's government - Chief Pleas - to progress, something he said he hasn't received. Sark's Seigneur Major Christopher Beaumont said the current grid needed replacing: ""It doesn't matter who does it, somebody has to replace the electricity system in Sark."" Mr Witney-Price described plans for another grid which would be in competition with his company's as ""nonsense"". He said: ""We'll have a competitor in the market which wants to charge more for electricity than I do, which is going to make my life easier. ""Having a competitor which will charge more than you is never a bad place to be. ""Chief Pleas haven't talked to me about this, because they don't want to.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67912689,"National Insurance: Is Jeremy Hunt right about £1,000 saving?","Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the cut to National Insurance would be worth: ""nearly £1,000 for a typical two-earner family"".",2024-01-08,"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the cut to National Insurance would be worth: ""nearly £1,000 for a typical two-earner family"". He was speaking to Today on BBC Radio 4 about the change that saw National Insurance (NI) come down by 2p in the pound, from 6 January. But the level of income at which people start paying NI and income tax (except in Scotland) has been frozen since April 2021. Once you take this into account, the benefit from the NI cut is considerably lower. We asked the Treasury how the chancellor worked out this figure and were told it was based on the saving for a family with two people on the average wage for a full-time employee. The average wage for a full-time employee is about £35,400. The ""nearly £1,000"" figure excludes the impact of other tax measures. In particular, the level of income at which people start paying NI has been frozen in the UK since April 2021. The point where they start paying income tax has also been frozen, except in Scotland, where it will be going up from £12,571 to £14,876 this year. The freezes mean more people pay taxes and more people pay higher rates of tax than would have happened if these tax thresholds had gone up in line with rising prices. Independent economic think-tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that if you factor the freeze in for April 2024, then the average earner would be saving £130 a year instead of £450 from the NI cut. And if you take into account all the freezes the government has implemented since 2021, then that worker would be just about getting back as much as they're losing this year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which makes economic forecasts for the government, expects the personal tax measures implemented in 2021 and 2022 to raise an extra £44.6bn in 2028-29, while the 2p cut in NI will give back £10bn of that. Mr Hunt talked about a ""typical two-earner family"". We do not know how many households have two members earning £35,400, but £70,800 between them may not be typical. For example, around 30% of working adults are part-time workers, according to the 2021 Census, who have an average annual income of about £12,500 before tax. The average income for a household was £35,000 in 2022 before taxes and benefits are taken into account, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The party will table a vote on Tuesday demanding ministers disclose how much it would cost to send each asylum seeker to Rwanda. The vote also demands ministers reveal cash given and set to be given to the East African country. In addition, Labour want to see the full memorandum of understanding ministers reached with Rwanda. The scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda was first announced by Boris Johnson in April 2022. The plan has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda from the UK so far. Sir Keir Starmer's party also want the government to publish papers revealed by the BBC which suggest Rishi Sunak had initially wanted to scale back the scheme when he was chancellor in 2022. Those documents were prepared in No 10 when Boris Johnson was trying to persuade Mr Sunak to sign off on the plan. On Sunday Mr Sunak denied ever doubting the policy would work, saying it was his job as chancellor to ask ""tough questions"" about the cost of every policy that crossed his desk. He said it was ""wrong"" to suggest that he did not ""believe in the scheme"". Labour want to force the vote on Tuesday afternoon as part of an opposition day, which allows the party to choose a subject for debate. The vote will take the form of a Humble Address - which technically means parliament is asking the King to compel the release of the documents, making the vote binding on the government. The opposition are optimistic that some Conservative MPs will back the motion - although it would be extremely unusual for the government to suffer a large enough rebellion to lose the vote. Tuesday's parliamentary gambit will force a Home Office minister to come to the Commons to justify the government's position on Rwanda before the next phase of parliamentary debates and votes on the Safety of Rwanda Bill, which would state that Rwanda should be considered a safe country under British law along with other provisions designed to put the policy on a stronger legal footing. The bill is expected to return to the Commons this month, most likely next week, with several factions of the Conservative Party uneasy about the plans - some fearing they may go too far, others believing they do not go far enough. Speaking at an event in Accrington on Monday, the prime minister said he would welcome ""bright ideas"" on how to improve the bill, but insisted ""my entire party is supportive"" of the legislation. He said: ""If people have bright ideas about how we can make this more effective whilst complying with our international obligations and retaining Rwanda's participation in the scheme… then of course, I'm open to having those discussions."" Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, told the BBC: ""It is totally unacceptable that the Conservatives have refused to come clean on the full costs of the failing Rwanda scheme. ""So far, costs are apparently rising to £400m of taxpayers' money with more home secretaries than asylum seekers sent to Kigali. ""The Conservatives should stop dragging out this chaos and come clean about the real costs and problems."" A government source said: ""We have already declared £240m that has been paid in our partnership agreement with the Rwandan government and one payment of £50m to come in April. ""After that the shadow home secretary's figures are her guesswork and for commercial sensitivity reasons we have not outlined any other potential payments that are all predicated on getting flights to Rwanda, which we are determined to do to stop the boats."" The source added: ""Labour don't like our plans, but really don't have anything at all to offer that would realistically tackle this now-global challenge of illegal migration.""","['UK immigration', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Refugees and asylum seekers']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0EAB/production/_131955730_sunakcapture.png'],['Henry Zeffman'],UK,Politics

Ms Vennells has been urged to forfeit her honour in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful prosecution of Post Office staff. The Forfeiture Committee can recommend honours are stripped if a person has brought the system into disrepute. Ms Vennells has apologised to Post Office staff. Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister shares the public's feeling of outrage on this issue. He would strongly support the Forfeiture Committee if it chose to review the case. ""It is a decision for the committee, rather than the government."" A petition addressed to senior civil servant Sir Chris Wormald, the chair of the Forfeiture Committee, calling for Ms Vennells to lose her honour has attracted more than one million signatures. The committee - which is made up of a Treasury solicitor and four independent members - can submit a recommendation for forfeiture through the prime minister to the King, who is the only person who can annul an honour. The committee does not give an opinion on whether a person is guilty of a particular act, only on whether the honours system has been brought into disrepute. An individual can also apply to have their honour voluntarily forfeited. Ms Vennells, who was Post Office chief executive between 2012 and 2019, has said previously that she remained ""truly sorry for the suffering caused to wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and their families"". She said: ""I continue to fully support and focus on co-operating with the [public] inquiry and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further while it remains ongoing."" Justice Secretary Alex Chalk met Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake on Monday to discuss how to help the convicted branch managers clear their names. MPs will hear a statement from Mr Hollinrake later. Ms Vennells was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) - an honour given to those making distinguished or notable contributions in a specific field - by the Queen in the 2019 New Years Honours for ""services to the Post Office and to charity"". Prior joining the Post Office in 2007, she worked for beauty brand L'Oréal and hospitality business Whitbread. Ms Vennells started as a group network director, then became managing director in 2010 before being promoted to the position of chief executive in 2012. She held the top job until February 2019, when she stepped down amid anger over the Horizon scandal. During her tenure, the company repeatedly denied there were problems with its IT system, Horizon. Ms Vennells took over as chair of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in April of the same year, but later stepped down when a group of Post Office operators won a High Court case in which their convictions were ruled wrongful and Horizon to be at fault. Their ruling was upheld on appeal in 2021. More than 700 Post Office branch owner-operators were wrongly prosecuted for theft, fraud and false accounting between 1999 and 2015 on the basis of faulty information from Horizon software. Some were imprisoned, others were pushed into bankruptcy and some have since died. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who was postal affairs minister from May 2010 and February 2012 during the coalition government - joined calls for Ms Vennells to have her CBE revoked. ""It shouldn't have been given in the first place,"" he said. ""The [Forfeiture] Committee needs to meet to make that decision."" A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""It would be inappropriate to comment on any individual honours recipient.""

Carla Denyer told the BBC it was already ""good way through"" selecting candidates to fulfil the aim, which would mark a first for the party. She said her party was open to talks with other parties about possible electoral pacts. But she ruled out withdrawing candidates unless other parties do too. The Greens are aiming to translate the record gains they made at last year's English local elections into increased representation at Westminster. Their only current MP, two-time former leader Caroline Lucas, is due to stand down at the next general election, which is almost certain to take place this year. Despite plans to stand in every constituency, Ms Lucas's Brighton Pavilion seat is among a handful of constituencies where the party plans to focus its resources. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Denyer said other targets include Bristol Central, a newly-created constituency largely replacing the Labour-held Bristol West seat, where she will be the party's candidate. The party is also targeting two more traditionally Tory areas: North Herefordshire and Waveney Valley, another newly-created seat straddling the border between Norfolk and Suffolk. Standing throughout England and Wales would require fielding 575 candidates, 103 more than at the 2019 election, when it stood in 472 constituencies across both countries. At the last election, the party struck an anti-Brexit pact with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, which saw them agree not to stand against each other in dozens of seats. It followed a series of locally-struck deals with the Lib Dems at the 2017 election that saw Green candidates stand aside in various constituencies. But that so-called ""progressive alliance"" led to a backlash within the party, with some figures arguing Labour benefitted most despite not agreeing to withdraw any candidates itself. Some figures within the party have argued that fielding a full slate of candidates would prevent local Green parties coming under pressure from Labour to stand down. And at its autumn conference last year, party members voted to ""maximise"" candidate numbers, with an ambition to stand in every English and Welsh seat. ""The Green Party is collaborative by nature. We're always keen to work with people on areas where we agree,"" Ms Denyer said when asked about possible election pacts. But she added: ""We're not about to roll over and hand over any unilateral gifts to other parties. ""Our position is that our door is open, it's always open, and we are prepared to talk to other parties, but we're not going to be standing down unliterally. ""If there is an opportunity to co-operate, we're open to that, and we've always made that clear so I think the other parties know it. ""But in the meantime, we are standing candidates in every single seat, so that everyone has the opportunity to vote Green."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said his ""working assumption"" is the next election will take place in the second half of 2024. The Greens had its best ever set of local elections last year, gaining more than 240 seats across England. A large part of that success came from targeting rural, traditionally Conservative areas. In Brighton and Hove, though, they lost almost two thirds of their seats, delivering the council into Labour control. Ms Denyer sought to dampen expectations ahead of this year's local polls in May, cautioning that the ""absolute number"" of any potential gains would be limited by the smaller number of councils being contested this time round. The Greens are currently polling at around 6%, behind Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats. The Scottish Greens, a separate party, have been sharing power with the SNP since 2021, following elections to the devolved Scottish Parliament.","['Green Party (England and Wales)', 'Carla Denyer']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1545F/production/_132253178_denyergetty.jpg'],"['Paul Seddon', 'Helen Catt']",UK,Politics
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67908791,Post Office scandal: Former minister calls for mass appeal against convictions,"Hundreds of sub-postmasters convicted in the Post Office Horizon scandal should be able to submit a mass appeal, a former cabinet minister has said.",2024-01-08,"Hundreds of sub-postmasters convicted in the Post Office Horizon scandal should be able to submit a mass appeal, a former cabinet minister has said. Sir David Davis, who is seeking to question ministers about the issue, told the BBC there was ""no real reason"" why there could not be a ""mass case"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has also said all cases need to be revisited. It comes as ministers met on Monday to consider ways of clearing the names of hundreds of sub-postmasters. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 Post Office branch managers were convicted of false accounting, theft and fraud based on the faulty Horizon software. Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined. Some have since died. It has been described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history, but to date only 93 convictions have been overturned and of them, just 30 people have agreed ""full and final"" compensation settlements, meaning many victims are still fighting to clear their names. Some 54 cases have resulted in either a conviction being upheld, people being refused permission to appeal, or the person appealing having withdrawn from the process. While the scandal has been public knowledge for some time with a public inquiry ongoing, an ITV drama - Mr Bates vs The Post Office - which aired last week has thrust the issue back into the spotlight. Speaking to the BBC, Sir David said the drama had galvanised the response to the scandal. ""There are now tens of millions of people who care about this - care a lot,"" he said. ""They're furious in many cases."" At present, all cases are considered individually, but Sir David said: ""All of the cases depend on one single lie, and that is nobody but the postmasters and mistresses could access their computers. We now know that to be untrue. I see no real reason, no logical reason you can't have a mass case, mass appeal on that basis."" Sir David and Labour MP Kevan Jones are among those hoping to scrutinise a minister in the House of Commons, which is reassembling on Monday for the first time since the Christmas recess. Sir Keir Starmer, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, has said that all convictions need to be looked at again, and prosecution powers should be taken away from the Post Office. Sir Keir said: ""I used to run the Crown Prosecution Service, we've prosecuted for other departments, we can do it here - that should be done straightaway. ""And these convictions, the remaining convictions need to be looked at en masse."" The Post Office, which is wholly owned by the government, acted as the prosecutor when it brought the cases against its sub-postmasters. It has the power in England and Wales to do so, and its appointed lawyers presented the evidence in court. The situation is different in Scotland and in Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the government is reviewing options, including stripping the Post Office of its role in the appeal process, and is also looking at how to speed up the compensation process, amid concerns it has been far too slow. On Monday, a petition calling for the former Post Office chief executive, Paula Vennells, to lose her CBE over the scandal passed more than one million signatures. The prime minister's spokesman said Mr Sunak would PM would back committee in Post Office honour probe if it decided to look at revoking Ms Vennells' CBE. Tracy Felstead and Janet Skinner, sub-postmistresses who were both jailed in connection with the scandal, told the BBC Ms Vennells should relinquish her CBE. ""To be fair, and if she had any decency she would just hand it back,"" Ms Skinner said. Ms Vennells has said previously that she remains ""truly sorry for the suffering caused to wrongly prosecuted sub-postmasters and their families"". She said: ""I continue to fully support and focus on co-operating with the [public] inquiry and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further while it remains ongoing."" Ms Felstead also said she would like to see ""someone held accountable"". ""We were classed as criminals by the Post Office,"" she said. ""Now it is their turn to be investigated and find out who knew what, why and when this all happened."" The Metropolitan Police is now investigating the Post Office over potential fraud offences arising from the prosecutions. The advisory board overseeing compensation for victims also renewed a call on Monday for all Post Office staff wrongly accused of theft and false accounting to have their convictions overturned. Its chairman, Prof Chris Hodges, told the BBC: ""We've come to the conclusion that the obvious thing to do is the right thing to do, which is for parliament to pass a very simple act, overturning all of them."" He argued that overturning all convictions would not encroach upon the independence of the judiciary ""This is not a situation in which anyone would complain that the government is breaching anyone's human rights,"" said Prof Hodges. He added that he would be ""very surprised"" if the judiciary ""weren't as angry and indeed embarrassed about the situation as we all are, so I don't think that there is a constitutional issue"". Last month, Prof Hodges said that while ""a small minority"" were ""doubtless genuinely guilty of something"", it would be ""worth acquitting a few guilty people (who have already been punished) in order to deliver justice to the majority"". However, former sub-postmistress Ms Felstead told the BBC that while the process of helping former sub-postmasters needed to be sped up, she cautioned against a mass exoneration. ""I think we need to be really careful that we're not just going to go and turn everybody's convictions over, just in case you have that one person that has committed a crime and you've just turned over their conviction,"" she said. A Post Office spokesperson has previously said it shares the ""aims of the public inquiry to get to the truth of what went wrong in the past and establish accountability"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-67763457,The candidates set for Wellingborough by-election,A by-election will be held in Wellingborough following a recall petition in the Northamptonshire constituency.,2024-01-08,"A by-election will be held in Wellingborough following a recall petition in the Northamptonshire constituency. The petition was prompted by Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons for six weeks for breaching the code of conduct for MPs. The date of the election is due to be confirmed when Parliament returns in January. So far, the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, and Reform UK have confirmed their candidates. Britain First has indicated it will also contest the by-election. Mr Bone could stand again, but it would be as an independent, as the Conservatives have suspended him. Candidates are listed in alphabetical order by surname. The Liberal Democrat candidate was born in Northamptonshire and grew up in the county. She joined Northamptonshire Police in 1985 and rose to the rank of inspector, serving across the county - including in Wellingborough - and she supervised the tactical firearms team. Ms Savage Gunn helped run security for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and later became a law enforcement consultant in the US, before her return to the UK and Northamptonshire. When Covid-19 broke out she retrained as a health care assistant and worked in her mother's care home, before becoming a Covid clinic co-ordinator in the county. She continues to work at the care home, and is a trustee of Northamptonshire Carers, in Wellingborough. Note: Gunn is used as the candidate's primary surname, hence she appears at the top of the alphabetical list. The candidate for Reform UK is the party's co-deputy leader and a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Brexit Party. Reform UK, previously the Brexit Party, was co-founded by Nigel Farage in 2018. Mr Habib is a property developer and fund manager, and previously a donor to the Conservatives. The 58-year-old said: ""I intend to give the Wellingborough by-election the best swing of my bat and if I am elected I will stand in the Commons and hold this wretched government to account to the very best of my ability."" Ms Harrison represents the Oundle ward on North Northamptonshire Council and is executive member for Adults, Health and Wellbeing on the authority. She also previously ran for Parliament in 2017 in the Derbyshire constituency of Bolsover. Ms Harrison said: ""I am delighted to have been selected as the candidate for Wellingborough. ""As the local candidate, I am best suited to deliver for the people of Wellingborough, having already done so on a local authority level."" She is also the partner of Mr Bone, who was first elected to the seat in 2005. Labour's candidate grew up in Northamptonshire and went to John Hellins Primary School in Towcester, and Kingsbrook secondary school - now Elizabeth Woodville School - in Roade. She has worked in the charity sector her whole career. In 2019, she stood as prospective parliamentary candidate for Labour in the South Northamptonshire constituency - losing to the Conservatives' Andrea Leadsom. After her selection in November, the Ms Kitchen said: ""Residents here are already telling me that they're fed up with the state of the town centre, anti-social behaviour blighting our high streets and the 8am scramble for a GP appointment. ""Labour has a plan to tackle these issues that impact so many here, but I will start by giving Wellingborough a voice in Westminster and working hard to restore pride in our town and villages."" Mr Morris, lives in Bozeat in the south of the constituency, having previously lived in Wellingborough, and works as an insurance underwriter. The 55-year-old has been a member of the Green Party for five years and has stood as the party's candidate for North Northamptonshire Council in Irchester and Rushden South. He has also served on Bozeat Parish Council for three years. Mr Morris said: ""What Wellingborough needs is a representative who knows and cares about local issues, rather than someone concerned with furthering their personal agenda in the national political arena. ""Local matters will always come first for me."" He has two children, aged 21 and 17, and is a season ticket holder at Northampton Saints. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-67759402,Peter Bone: How Wellingborough ended up with a by-election,"Following a recall petition triggered by MP Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons,",2024-01-08,"Following a recall petition triggered by MP Peter Bone's suspension from the House of Commons, a by-election will be held in Wellingborough. How did the Northamptonshire constituency end up without an MP and having to go to the polls? The 71-year-old has been active in Conservative politics since the 1970s, but did not make it to Parliament until 2005, when he won the Wellingborough seat. In 2019, he had a majority of 18,540 in the constituency. A prominent Brexit-supporter, he campaigned with Nigel Farage in the 2016 referendum. Also a leading voice on the right of the Tory party, he briefly served as deputy Commons leader under Boris Johnson. He was known for jokey references in Parliament to his wife Jenny (""Mrs Bone"") - but the couple split in 2016 and he is reportedly in a new relationship. Mr Bone made frequent media appearances and notable interjections in the Commons, such as raising the issue of flies in Rushden and breaking protocol by wearing a hat to promote a local charity. Mr Bone was suspended for six weeks following an inquiry into his behaviour earlier this year. An investigation by Parliament's behaviour watchdog, the Independent Expert Panel, found Mr Bone broke sexual misconduct rules by indecently exposing himself to a staff member during an overseas trip. It also upheld five allegations of bullying, including verbally belittling, physically striking and throwing things at the staff member. The alleged victim told the BBC ""physical, emotional and psychological abuse"" by the MP left him a ""broken shell of the young man I once was"". Mr Bone has denied the allegations and returned to the Commons - after his suspension - to vote on the Rwanda bill. A recall petition lets voters remove an MP between general elections. It is triggered if an MP is convicted of a crime or suspended from the Commons for more than 10 days. If 10% of voters in the constituency sign the petition, the seat becomes vacant. This petition was open for six weeks from 8 November to 19 December and was backed by 10,505 people - which equates to 13.2% of the electorate. It means a by-election is due to be held this year. It is not known whether Mr Bone will stand but if he does it will be as an independent. The Conservative Party has selected Helen Harrison as its candidate, Gen Kitchen will be standing for the Labour Party and Ana Savage Gunn will represent the Lib Democrats. Will Morris is the Green Party candidate for Wellingborough and Reform UK has selected Ben Habib for the by-election. Britain First has also indicated it will contest the by-election. A date for the by-election has not yet been set and constituents will have to wait until Parliament sits again in January to find out when it will be. The BBC has a list of candidates who have said they would be standing for election and it will be updated once the formal election process gets under way.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67871981,How portable X-ray machines are helping remote patients,"Portable X-ray machines ""can literally be the difference between life and death"", says radiographer Sam Pilkington.",2024-01-08,"Portable X-ray machines ""can literally be the difference between life and death"", says radiographer Sam Pilkington. For most of us, if we need to be X-rayed the procedure is done in a hospital. But for acutely unwell patients, or for infection control, Miss Pilkington says that portable machines are very helpful. This is because ""they remove the excess burden of transportation from the patients"", says the final-year student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, who is also a member of the Institute of Physics. Instead the X-ray equipment goes to them. There are obvious advantages for remote locations, including battlefields, roadsides and disaster zones. And thanks to the increased availability - and ability - of such portable systems their usage is growing rapidly. With the coronavirus pandemic fuelling this increase, the global portable X-ray market was worth a reported $7.1bn (£5.6bn) last year. And this is expected to rise to $14bn by 2028. In simple terms there are two types of portable X-ray machines - those on wheels, which are generally described as ""mobile"", and the lightest devices that can be carried by a single person. These are generally described as ""ultraportable"". One remote place that has tested ultraportable X-ray hardware is the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Prior to a trial there from November 2021 to January 2022, 73% of patients who were due for an X-ray did not attend their appointments - due in large part to the costs and time needed to reach distant hospitals. During the trial, a handheld device made by Japanese firm Fujifilm was taken to local clinics. Called the Fujifilm Xair, it weighs just 3.5kg, and is only 301mm (12 inches) wide and 144mm tall. As a result of its use, the non-attendance rate for X-rays appointments was reduced to zero. As one patient commented to the subsequent report: ""This is hugely beneficial to people on the small islands. Much less upheaval for frailer patients."" German company OR Technology is another manufacturer of portable X-ray machines. Tim Thurn, its chief commercial officer, says it is seeing great interest from emerging markets. ""There's a huge demand for bringing healthcare to the people,"" he says. In the Philippines, Nigeria and other countries in the developing world, portable X-ray systems are transforming screening for tuberculosis (TB), which kills approximately 1.3 million people a year despite being preventable and curable. It's long been known that a chest X-ray is the best screening tool for TB, explains Suvanand Sahu, the deputy executive director of the Stop TB Partnership. This Swiss-based organisation represents more than 1,500 government and non-government bodies around the world. But he says that access to X-rays was historically hampered by a lack of hospitals. This was particularly the case in remote areas, and among remote, nomadic and displaced groups. Dr Sahu says that portable X-ray machines, which often include artificial intelligence software to quickly process the images, have been a powerful solution that allows detection to be successfully done out in the field. ""About 10 years ago, if we would have said 'we can we do an X-ray in the community, with the computer reading it', I think people would have jumped out of their seats. But it has happened now."" Dr Sahu adds that the AI has enabled a ""quantum leap"" in how accurately and quickly these X-rays can be read. Yet some are worried about the radiation released by portable X-ray machines. Portable X-ray equipment works in the same way as the big, fixed machines in radiology departments in hospitals - the image is created by a targeted burst of ionizing radiation. In hospitals, x-ray rooms are carefully designed to minimise radiation exposure, for instance with lead walls. Mr Thurn says that with portable systems this lack of shielding is compensated for by the greater space where they are used, be it outdoors, or in a field hospital setup. In these cases he says that healthcare workers can stand much further away. However, the issue of radiation needs to be clarified, as currently the international guidelines on radiation safety ""are designed for the traditional fixed type of X-ray"", says Zhi Zhen Qin, a digital health specialist at the Stop TB Partnership. The image quality of portable X-ray machines used to be a concern as well. But Miss Pilkington says that today's machines rival fixed units in this regard: ""The images that are taken on those machines are of a comparable diagnostic standard."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. However, there are barriers to just how small the components of an X-ray system can get. If an X-ray detector is too small to capture a body part in a single exposure, extra images might need to be taken, which would add to time burdens and radiation doses. And units with a limited battery life or data storage, reduce how many patients can be imaged in one session. Meanwhile, some systems described as portable aren't exactly lightweight and easily transported, particularly if they need other hardware to make them work like a stand or computer equipment. Yet Australian firm Micro-X is now making much lighter ultraportable x-ray machines, due to its new technology that can produce the X-rays without creating heat. This does away with the need for oil and motors for cooling, which add weight. The high cost of portable X-ray machines is also an issue. While they are cheaper than the larger fixed machines, they are still very expensive. The Stop TB Partnership says that the price of ultraportable machines ranges between $47,000 and $66,000. There are additional costs for warranties, installation and software. Dr Suvanand says that as more manufacturers enter this space, ""we hope that the competition will drive down the prices"". Ultimately, his vision for the future is that ""everybody who needs an X-ray should have access to this type of modern, digital, ultra-portable X-ray with AI capability"".","['Tuberculosis', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Orkney Islands', 'X-rays']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/123D6/production/_132201747_setupofthexairx-rayunitonitsstandpartofacarshowcasingultraportablefujifilmproducts.creditchristinero..jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/3D5E/production/_132201751_aradiologistexaminesadigitalx-raytakenwithanultraportabledevice.creditidds-stoptbpartnership..jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8B7E/production/_132201753_leonardodrminiiiix-raycase.creditortechnology..jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/171F6/production/_132201749_chestx-rayaspartoftuberculosisscreening.creditidds-stoptbpartnership..jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/650/cpsprodpb/114DB/production/_114957807_bbc_wn_new_tech_economy_650x62.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png']",['Christine Ro'],Business,New Tech Economy

Complainants will receive a cut of a $500m (£394m) settlement which works out to around $92 (£72) per claim. Apple agreed to settle the lawsuit in 2020, stating at the time it denied any wrongdoing but was concerned with the cost of continuing litigation. A similar case under way in the UK is seeking £1.6bn in compensation. The US case dates back to December 2017, when Apple confirmed a long-held suspicion among phone owners by admitting it had deliberately slowed down some iPhones as they got older. It said that as batteries aged, their performance decreased, and so the ""slowdown"" lengthened the phones' lifespan. But it was accused of throttling the performance of certain iPhones without telling its customers, and the uproar resulted in Apple offering a cut-price battery replacement to fix the problem. It led to the US legal action. At the time of the settlement, it was estimated that each person might receive as little as $25 each but the actual pay-out appears to be almost four times that sum. In the UK, Apple lost a bid to block a similar mass action lawsuit last November. The case, first brought by Justin Gutmann in June 2022, represents an estimated 24 million iPhone users. Apple has previously called the lawsuit ""baseless"" and said ""we have never - and would never - do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades"". Mr Gutmann told the BBC he was pleased to hear about payments being made in the US, but warned it does not have any bearing on the UK case. ""It doesn't advance our position here, they haven't admitted anything - they've settled,"" he said. ""It's a moral victory but not much use to me. I've got to plough on and pursue the case in the UK jurisdiction."" He said Apple was ""fighting tooth and nail"" against the UK class action, which will next appear at the Court of Appeal who will consider a call from the firm to halt the case. He said it was difficult to put a timeline on what would come next but hopes it will go to trial in late 2024 or early 2025.","['Apple', 'Mobile phones', 'iPhones']",['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/BA42/production/_132228674_d6cdcc40-d2a0-4147-b1d8-64af58307909.jpg'],['Tom Gerken'],Tech,Tech

""Abba Voyage had the luxury of capturing live performers, but we're not that fortunate,"" Mr McGuinness said. He added: ""The AI generates an authentic version of Elvis, born of original material, but it [also] allows you to do new things with him."" Mr McGuinness founded Layered Reality in 2017 with the objective of combining emerging technology with theatrical story telling to create a new form of entertainment. ""People didn't want to just watch a story play out in front of them, they wanted to be part of it,"" he said. ""Theatre and very talented actors make that personal, the tech allows us to achieve things that otherwise would be impossible."" The company now runs two venues in London - one based on Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds and another retelling the story of The Gunpowder Plot. ""People feel like they're actually in 1605 or face to face with a Martian fighting machine,"" Mr McGuinness said. The Layered Reality founder said everything they learnt about story telling from previous work will be implemented into Elvis Evolution. Although many have compared the project to the Abba virtual concert show, Mr McGuinness said the experience is more about narrative, like a film. Small groups move through the experience making it ""far more intimate than Abba Voyage but equally uplifting and fun"". The show is still being worked on and the life-sized digital Elvis will make his stage debut in November at a central London location which has yet to be confirmed. ""He's lines of code for now, he's not walking around Harpenden, buying a coffee from Gail's,"" joked Mr McGuinness. Presley, who rose to fame in the 1950s, died in 1977 aged 42. He was know for hits including Hound Dog and Suspicious Minds and would have celebrated his 89th birthday on 8 January. A film about Presley's life, directed by Baz Luhrmann, was released in 2022 and another movie, Priscilla, released in the UK this week, examines the relationship between the singer and his ex-wife. Virtual concerts and events have risen in popularity since Abba launched Abba Voyage in London in May 2022. The concert recreated a 1970s-era digital version of the singers who performed in their very own purpose-built 3,000-capacity arena in east London. It was created by 1,000 visual effects artists and took one billion computing hours to animate the avatars. It makes an estimated £2m per week and, since 2022, has contributed £322.6m in turnover to the London economy. Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51444789,"Flooding: What are my rights if my home, car or work is affected?","The storms that have swept the UK in recent weeks have brought widespread flooding and left homeowners, motorists and businesses counting the costs.",2024-01-08,"The storms that have swept the UK in recent weeks have brought widespread flooding and left homeowners, motorists and businesses counting the costs. After Storm Henk, which the Environment Agency said left more than 1,800 homes flooded, the government said it would release thousands of pounds to help communities recover. Many affected have been contacting their insurance companies for advice. But cover and compensation can vary significantly depending on the level of impact and the small print in policies, although other automatic protection may be in place. Safety is the key priority, so residents and business owners and their employees should only return to the property when it is safe to do so. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says most home buildings, contents and commercial business policies cover storm damage. Commercial policies cover damage to premises and stock. Business interruption cover, which may be included or purchased separately as part of an insurance agreement, will cover additional trading costs. Comprehensive motor insurance covers the cost of repairing or replacing vehicles damaged by storms. The ABI has a six-step recovery guide on what to do if your home or business is flooded: The ABI's general insurance policy adviser Louise Clark said insurers expect bad weather and events like these ""are exactly what your insurance is for"". ""Their priority right now is to help any affected customers recover as quickly as possible,"" she added. But insurance loss assessors Harris Balcombe told the BBC flood victims should be prepared to wait to have their claims assessed because industry resources were in ""dire straits"". Partner Alex Balcombe said: ""The sense I'm getting is that although the storms have not been as severe, there's been a larger number and this incremental 'drip, drip, drip' has left people waiting a long time. ""Adjusters can't give policy holders the assurance they need."" The ABI said there had been eight storms across the UK in the last three months and that insurers were ""working round the clock"" to support customers. ""Where supply chains are stretched, insurers will look to triage the most vulnerable wherever possible and will keep customers updated so that they know when repairs can be carried out,"" adviser Ms Clark said. In the meantime, policyholders are advised to avoid throwing things away where possible. But Mr Balcombe suggested the situation was being made worse because many consumers are under-insured, having bought the ""cheapest product they can find online"". The government says money will be available to help communities in England who have experienced ""exceptional localised flooding"". Applicants need to be in ""eligible affected areas"".  Help will be available for: Some homes have been without power during these storms, making life particularly uncomfortable during the extreme weather. There are rules in place that mean compensation may be paid by the local electricity distributor. The level of compensation is £70, with further payments of £70 if the situation continues for a long time. However, whether this is payable, and when, depends on the severity of the situation in each area. The Energy Ombudsman, an impartial referee following complaints, points out that residents without power should be kept updated on the situation and on their right to compensation by their local distributor. Employees are urged to contact their workplace if they have problems getting to work and employers should try to provide alternative working arrangements where possible, according to the latest advice from the conciliation service Acas. ""Extreme weather has caused disruption across much of the road and rail networks which will impact workers' ability to travel to work. ""Some employers will also have concerns about staff absences impacting their productivity and performance,"" a statement from the organisation said. Acas's top tips for workers affected by the bad weather include: The service also says if you're available to work but your place of work is closed, then you will usually be entitled to normal pay. A host of rail routes have been affected by the recent storms, owing to fallen trees and debris on the line, as well as flooding. A number of train operating companies in affected areas have issued advice for customers. Generally, refunds are available for cancelled trains, or if you do not want to travel owing to the weather. For delays, irrespective of the reason, many companies offer an automatic compensation service, although a claim still needs to be made. It can be more complicated for those with season tickets. Some companies still operate under rules where they are not obliged to give any kind of refund if the delay is beyond their control, and severe weather does fall into that category. If you are booked on a specific service which is cancelled, then you must check with staff instead of simply getting on the next available train to your destination. There is more clarity for planes than for trains. If a flight is cancelled then you can take a refund, or an alternative route or flight to your destination. You must talk to the airline, rather than booking it yourself. The airline should look after you, such as providing meals if it is a long delay, but they do not have to pay the extra compensation that would be due had the delay been the airline's fault.","['Personal finance', 'Money', 'Floods', 'Severe weather', 'Insurance']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/0015/production/_132212000_d23734336adff3ac7d9f1c5f038c3d6358ca287d0_0_3500_20001000x571.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4205/production/_132210961_gloucester-index-bbc.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/175BF/production/_132197659_gettyimages-1904519145.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/D00E/production/_132126235_mediaitem132126234.jpg']","['Kevin Peachey', 'Jemma Dempsey']",Science,Science

The local deer population is believed to be three times higher than what it should be. Culling has been used to try to control the population of deer and limit their impact. PETA UK's vice president of programmes Elisa Allen said culling was ""ineffective"" and ""cruel"". ""It [the deer population] is having a significant impact on our woodland economy,"" countryside manager Ash Walmsley said. ""We need to find a way of sustainably managing our deer population or else we will not have a healthy woodland habitat for wildlife to thrive,"" he added. The Woodland Trust said over-grazing from deer could prevent the regeneration of woodland, which can have a knock-on impact on other species. Mr Walmsley said impacted animals in Ashdown Forest include dormice and some butterfly species. Ms Allen argued that killing deer only caused their population to rebound as it resulted in a spike in food supply, accelerating the breeding of those alive. Ms Allen said: ""It can be difficult for hunters to get a clear shot and deer often endure slow, horrifyingly painful deaths."" ""We will never achieve ecological harmony through the barrel of a gun,"" she added. Mr Walmsley said he would be ""all for"" an alternative method to culling if it was feasible and successful.

The shows have been running at the Royal Albert Hall since 2000, raising more than £32m from ticket sales. Daltrey will kick off his final year by staging two orchestral sets with The Who. Noel Gallagher, Young Fathers and The Chemical Brothers will also play. The series will end with a celebration of the series of shows. Titled Ovation, the concert will feature Daltrey himself, accompanied by artists who helped establish the gigs as a fixture of the music calendar. The line-up will include Robert Plant, Paul Weller, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, the Stereophonics' Kelly Jones and Daltrey's long-time musical foil, Pete Townshend. From 2025, the concerts will be overseen by a series of guest curators. Daltrey will continue as a Teenage Cancer Trust Honorary Patron. In a statement, the rock star said: ""The £32m raised from these concerts has been the foundation for the 28 specialised units within the NHS, as well as specialist nurses and youth workers to be there for a young person when cancer has turned their world upside down."" Gallagher added: ""Teenage Cancer Trust continue to make a real difference to teenagers in what undoubtedly must be the most challenging years of their lives. ""Having performed at the very first event back in 2000, it is a charity very close to my heart."" Here are some of the hundreds of stars who have performed at the concerts over the last quarter of a century.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-67903124,Idris Elba urges stronger action on knife crime,"Idris Elba is calling on the government to immediately ban the sale of so-called ""zombie"" knives and machetes, to reduce the number of young people losing their lives.",2024-01-08,"Idris Elba is calling on the government to immediately ban the sale of so-called ""zombie"" knives and machetes, to reduce the number of young people losing their lives. The actor told the BBC a planned change to the law, which would introduce the ban, needs to be fast-tracked. He accused politicians of not giving the issue ""the focus it deserves"". The Home Office said on Monday in a statement it ""will not hesitate to do more to keep our streets safe"". It said bans on zombie and cyclone knives are already in place ""and work under way to extend this to include zombie-style machetes"". Zombie knives are defined as weapons having ""a cutting edge, a serrated edge and images or words suggesting they are used for violence"". They were first added to the government's list of prohibited offensive weapons in 2016. But Labour has said a loophole allowing the sale of the knives online still exists. Last August, Rishi Sunak unveiled plans to ban more of the weapons and give police extra powers to seize machetes and zombie knives. The latest move is also designed to help police with situations which fall outside the current laws. In particular, officers have been unable to deal with zombie knives designed to get around the 2016 definition, by not having ""images or words... that suggest it is to be used for the purposes of violence"". But it is not clear when the new law will come into force. Elba, best known for his roles in Luther and The Wire, attended an event in Parliament Square on Monday morning, where clothes were laid out to represent those killed by knives on UK streets. Organisers hope the display will demonstrate the huge human cost of knife crime, as MPs return to Parliament from the Christmas recess. The event is part of Elba's Don't Stop Your Future campaign, which works with local communities and well-known brands to try to tackle serious violence. The London-born actor, 51, said he ""can't stay silent as young lives are lost to brutal and heartless crimes"". Yemi Hughes, whose 19-year-old son Andre Aderemi was murdered in 2016, has given her support to Elba's campaign - and donated the outfit her son was wearing when he was killed. Andre was stabbed multiple times in broad daylight in Croydon, south London. Speaking to the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme, Ms Hughes recalled the last time she saw her son. ""When he got out of the car, I said, 'I'm dropping you off with a heavy heart'. I don't know why I said those words, I suppose it's a mother's gut instinct, but he looked at me with a great big smile and said, 'Don't worry mum, I'll be fine, I love you,' and with that I drove off."" Within 20 minutes, Ms Hughes had received a phone call from a friend's mother who said someone had been stabbed. ""I knew she was talking about Andre even though she hadn't said his name, and then she let out this almighty scream that I'll never forget. She'd obviously seen it was him."" By the time Ms Hughes got to the scene, ambulances and police were already there. She followed the ambulance to the hospital, where she was told her son had died. Ms Hughes said she was frustrated that knife crime was still a big problem. ""Our individual voices have not been heard, but yet our pain continues to be felt by families whose children are still being murdered. ""Young people need to feel safe in their communities and underlying causes of youth violence eradicated immediately."" The latest police figures for England and Wales from July 2022 to June 2023 show that around 247 people lost their lives due to knife crime. Those numbers do not include teenagers like 15-year-old Alfie Lewis who was fatally stabbed in Leeds in November 2023 or 16-year-old Harry Pitman, who was killed in north London on New Year's Eve 2023. Their deaths will be recorded in the next set of crime figures. Elba is also releasing a single, Knives Down, in support of his Don't Stop Your Future campaign. The track is about his frustration with the government for what he perceives as their inaction on knife crime. Speaking to Radio 4 programme, he said he wants to see more funding for groups working with young people. Although best known as an actor, Elba has released music and collaborated with artists such as Jay-Z and James Blake. His biggest hit came when he provided guest vocals on Wiley's hit Boasty in 2019. Serious knife crime in the Metropolitan Police area is three times higher than in the West Midlands or Greater Manchester, according to the latest figures for recorded offences from June 2023. Children and young adults are most likely to be victims or perpetrators of knife crime. While the ethnicity of victims is not always recorded, NHS figures for the year ending 2022 show that the number of people treated for stabbing injuries from Black, Asian and ""other ethnicities"" was far higher than for White patients. However, the reasons behind this are subject to constant debate by politicians and experts in youth crime. Knife crime is clearly linked to gang activity. But there is an argument about what a gang is. Police intelligence tends to represent gangs as organised and cohesive criminal groups, while young workers often see them as looser friendship groups. Police officers stress the role of drugs in driving gang crime. The 'country lines' business-model now adopted by most drugs gangs relies on recruiting young people, and many are active in areas with large non-white populations. Many experts point to the role of social media in driving rivalries between groups of young people, which spill out from the internet to the streets. But there is general agreement that ""adverse childhood experiences"" are a major cause of young people becoming involved in crime. The Home Office's Serious Violence Strategy highlighted the role of abuse, neglect, parental criminality, substance abuse, and being taken into care. These factors are why many experts now advocate a ""public health"" approach to preventing youth crime. This involves identifying young people likely to become ""infected"" and finding ways of diverting them into healthier lifestyles. Patrick Green from the Ben Kinsella Trust says immediate action is needed to ban zombie knives and machetes. ""Four months have passed since we were promised the legislation we so desperately need to ban these weapons, yet the bill has only just started its agonisingly slow journey through Parliament,"" he said. ""The government has demonstrated that, when they deem it necessary, parliamentary time can be found to expedite bills with urgency. ""So, why, when we know that these knives are being used to take the lives of our children, are they not prioritising a ban with the same urgency?"" A Home Office spokesperson said the UK ""has some of the toughest laws in the world to tackle knife crime"". They added: ""Hospital admissions for young people with serious knife injuries are down over a quarter and overall knife crime is down 7 percent, and we will not hesitate to do more to keep our streets safe. ""That is why through the Criminal Justice Bill, we will give the police more powers to seize dangerous weapons and increase prison sentences for anyone caught with a knife.""","['Knife crime', 'Idris Elba']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/92EC/production/_132221673_268243ef2ef9591e512cd0179349eeb1b6e8949d.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/18328/production/_132221199_harrypitman.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5BD9/production/_123331532_tomsymonds_tr-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1270C/production/_132223557_38ac08789efc814a4501eb7801d69ba30d826225.jpg']","['Charlotte Gallagher', 'Noor Nanji']",Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts

It will be the first time she's appeared on reality TV since her ex Stephen Bear was jailed for for posting intimate footage of her. She'll be joined in the villa by 11 other Love Island stars including Kaz Kamwi and Toby Aromolaran. Maya Jama will also return to host the spin-off being filmed in South Africa. Georgia, 29, has become known for campaigning on women's safety since Stephen Bear was sentenced to 21 months in prison last March. Announcing her return to the villa, she said the past year had been ""amazing"" but ""heavy at times and pretty serious with all of my campaigning work"". Now Georgia, who first appeared on series three of the ITV2 show in 2017, says she wants to go back into the villa to ""have some fun and hopefully meet someone that I can fall in love with"". The villa is also a place where friendships are made, and that's the case for Kaz Kamwi and Liberty Poole, who've become best mates since appearing in 2021's series. Kaz said meeting Liberty was the memory she ""loved and treasured the most"", but both are expecting a different experience this time around. ""I'm a lot more confident in who I am and sure about exactly what I want from a relationship,"" Liberty said. They'll be joined by fellow All Stars Chris Taylor, Georgia Steele, Anton Danyluk, Hannah Elizabeth, Demi Jones, Jake Cornish, Luis Morrison and Mitchel Taylor. Chris Taylor, who briefly dated Maura Higgins, made a brief cameo as a Ken in last year's Barbie movie. He got the role after meeting Margot Robbie, and said his ""silly chat"" must have ""made an impression"" on the star. ""Eighteen months later I got an email from Warner Bros asking: 'Do you want to try out for this role as Ken?',"" he said. Love Island's ratings have seen a steady drop over the past few years, with last summer's first episode losing more than one million viewers compared with 2022. It's faced competition from a crop of new rivals like BBC Three's I Kissed a Boy, the UK's first gay dating show, and scrutiny over its duty of care to contestants. All Stars is the latest attempt to put a new spin on the format after the recent Love Island Games, which saw islanders from around the world compete in challenges.

The TV presenter announced on Friday that the 56-year-old had died after living with extreme complications from Covid. In a video message on Good Morning Britain, Garraway said messages of support ""really does mean so much"". She added that they were of ""extraordinary comfort"" to her family. Draper, an author and former political adviser, married Garraway in 2005 and had two children with her, Darcey and Billy. He suffered long-lasting symptoms from coronavirus and required daily care, which Garraway chronicled in ITV documentaries. In a message to GMB viewers, Garraway said on Monday: ""I'm so lucky to feel connected to you all through these messages at this time when the raw pain of grief can be so isolating. ""I am certain that it is the support that you have given me and sent to Derek that has sustained us through these tough nearly four years, motivating us to fight on for each other and for those who can't fight for themselves and it will sustain us to continue that fight in the weeks and months and years to come. ""I look forward to waking up with you very soon again on Good Morning Britain to celebrate life in all its wonder and challenge again."" She continued: ""I hope you forgive me for taking some time to be at home. My family is so grateful that we could be with our dearest Derek in his final moments - something not all get to share. ""Maybe you too are going through grief yourself or have done in the past. I send love and support for you too. ""We are taking time to heal ourselves now that Darcey and Billy know their daddy is at peace and free from pain and struggle. I shall be thinking of you all until we are reunited very soon. ""In the meantime, hug your loved ones close. All my love, Kate."" On Friday former prime minister Sir Tony Blair led the tributes, describing Draper as a ""good colleague and great friend"". After being diagnosed with Covid, Draper was put into a coma in April 2020 and did not wake from it until the October of that year. Despite being Covid-free by early June, his body had undergone significant damage and he had been re-admitted several times to hospital over the past four years. It was reported on GMB in December that Draper was in ""a very serious condition"" after suffering a heart attack. Garraway is taking an indefinite leave of absence and has cancelled all of her TV and radio work.","['Television', 'Coronavirus', 'Long Covid']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/8C6F/production/_126015953_gettyimages-85791462.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1677F/production/_132213029_derek-index-shutterstock.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/59F7/production/_132213032_cr2c7a18ff6f6d6c50845fb4a9650f9c97de242929.jpg']",['Yasmin Rufo'],Entertainment & Arts,Entertainment & Arts
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-66134840,Captain Sir Tom Moore: What has happened to his legacy?,"With the charity set up in the name of Capt Sir Tom Moore the subject of a statutory inquiry and his daughter embroiled in a local planning row, the BBC looks at how the legacy of the man who won the nation's hearts stands in the nation's minds at the moment.",2024-01-08,"With the charity set up in the name of Capt Sir Tom Moore the subject of a statutory inquiry and his daughter embroiled in a local planning row, the BBC looks at how the legacy of the man who won the nation's hearts stands in the nation's minds at the moment. Captain Sir Tom Moore's extraordinary fundraising efforts for National Health Service charities are part of Covid-19 pandemic history, but the charity set up by his family in his honour is no longer taking donations. Just over a year ago, the Charity Commission launched an inquiry into the finances of the Captain Tom Foundation and a building which used the charity's name when it first got planning permission must now be torn down. Capt Sir Tom was born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, in 1920. He served in India and Myanmar during World War Two, when it was known as Burma, but at the age of 99 he became an international star by walking laps around his garden. Early in April 2020, near the start of the coronavirus pandemic, he said he wanted to complete 100 laps of his patio before his 100th birthday at the end of that month, in an attempt to raise an initial £1,000 for the National Health Service. At the time, the NHS was under pressure dealing with thousands of Covid-19 patients, and with the nation in lockdown and wanting to help in some way, a determined old man and his walking frame captured a moment and people donated in their droves. He eventually raised a whopping £38m for NHS Charities Together, which works with a network of more than 230 NHS Charities across the UK to support the organisation. Not only did his efforts encourage thousands to donate, but he inspired many to join his campaign. A week before his 100th birthday, Capt Sir Tom became the oldest person ever to get to number one in the UK singles charts, when his duet of You'll Never Walk Alone - with singer Michael Ball - took the top spot. His 100th birthday on 30 April 2020 was marked with an RAF flypast, personal birthday greetings from the Queen and prime minister, and he was made an honorary colonel of the British Army. On 17 July 2020, he was knighted for his fundraising efforts in the grounds of Windsor Castle. In October 2023, PR specialist Daisy Souster, who helped the family launch the initial charity appeal said she was ""cut out"" by the family and was told by Capt Sir Tom's daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, that she had ""no right"" to talk about her role. Ms Ingram-Moore has not responded to the BBC's request for comment about this issue. Capt Sir Tom died in February 2021 aged 100, with coronavirus. He had become ill not long after his family took him on holiday to Barbados in December 2020 after British Airways paid for his flight, and he tested positive for Covid-19 in hospital in January. His family said due to other medication he was receiving for pneumonia, he had been unable to be vaccinated. After his death, the Captain Tom Foundation was set up by his family to support ""causes close to Captain Sir Tom's heart"" - many of which are detailed on the charity's website including the Florence Nightingale Hospice in Buckinghamshire, the Willen Hospice in Milton Keynes and national organisation Mind. In February 2022, the Charity Commission announced it would be reviewing the accounts of the charity. Grants of £160,000 were given to four charities by the Foundation in its first year, but it had paid more than £162,000 in management costs in the same period. According to the published accounts, covering the charity's first year from 5 May 2020 to 31 May 2021, it paid out grants to four charities worth £40,000 each, but spent £209,433 on support costs - including the £162,336 on ""management"". The financial statement also showed reimbursement costs of £16,097 paid to Club Nook Limited - a company run by Hannah Ingram-Moore, the younger of Capt Sir Tom's two daughters, set up shortly before the formation of the charity. The Foundation had said it welcomed the Charity Commission's input. In June 2022, the Commission said it had launched an inquiry into the foundation amid concerns his family may have profited from using his name. It said it was concerned about the charity's independence from Club Nook, as well as the trustees' decision-making and how the Foundation was governed. In August 2023, a BBC Newsnight investigation found that thousands of pounds was paid to Maytrix Group, a company owned by Ms Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin, for appearances by her in connection with the Captain Tom Foundation charity - and not to the foundation itself. She did not respond to those claims but when the foundation's latest accounts were published in September 2023, showing that the watchdog's intervention into the charity had a ""massive adverse impact"" on fundraising, she posted a statement on her verified Instagram account. Income had been more than £1m for the 2020-2021 financial year, but fell to £402,854 from June 2021 to November 2022. Ms Ingram-Moore said she had not been involved in the foundation ""in any capacity"" since April 2022, and had not made any payments from the charity's bank account during her time as interim chief executive. In an interview on TalkTV's Piers Morgan Uncensored in October 2023, Ms Ingram-Moore said the family kept the profits from three books that Captain Sir Tom wrote for themselves - at her father's request. In the prologue to his autobiography, Tomorrow will be a Good Day, which came out in 2020, he said that ""with the offer to write this memoir I have also been given the chance to raise even more money"" for the foundation. But Ms Ingram-Moore said there had been no agreement with her father that book money - reportedly £800,000 - would go to charity. There is no suggestion that she has acted illegally by keeping the money, rather than donating it to her late father's charity. In the same interview, she said her family had received death threats and were left feeling ""devastated"" by negative reactions to them. In July 2023 the charity announced that it was not actively seeking donations or making payments. It said its ""sole focus...is to ensure that it cooperates fully with the on-going statutory inquiry by the Charity Commission"". A statement added that when the inquiry concluded it would ""be in a better position to make a decision in relation to its future"". At a planning appeal in hearing in October 2023, to decide a separate matter regarding a controversial spa built in the family's garden, their lawyer Scott Stemp said the foundation was ""unlikely to exist"" in the future, following the Charity Commission's investigation. The foundation's announcement came as it was reported that Ms Ingram-Moore, who lived with Capt Sir Tom in The Old Rectory, a Grade II listed building in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, was told to knock down an unauthorised building used as a home spa. The building on the site of the family home - originally approved for the use of the occupiers and the Captain Tom Foundation - had received planning permission in August 2021 and had been partly constructed when revised plans were submitted in February 2022, which included a spa pool, toilets and a kitchen ""for private use"". The revised plans for what was called the Captain Tom Building were turned down by Central Bedfordshire Council in November 2022. A demolition order for the now-unauthorised building was issued, the council said. The Planning Inspectorate confirmed an appeal had been received and held an in-person hearing on 17 October 2023, attended by the family. In documents submitted for the appeal, the family said the structure was ""no more overbearing than the consented scheme"". Colin Ingram-Moore said there were ""no grounds supporting the refusal of the retrospective application"" and asked the inspectorate to uphold the family's appeal. At the hearing, their chartered surveyor said the project had ""evolved"" to include the spa pool which ""has the opportunity to offer rehabilitation sessions for elderly people in the area"". A neighbour argued that the building was ""49% bigger than what was consented"". On 7 November, the Planning Inspectorate announced it had dismissed the appeal. In a letter announcing the decision, planning inspector Diane Fleming said the ""scale and massing"" of the partially-built structure had ""resulted in harm"" to The Old Rectory and that the ""suggested public benefit would not outweigh the great weight to be given to the harm to the heritage asset"". The family had three months to comply with the existing demolition order although there was a period of six weeks during which the decision could be challenged in the High Court. The deadline to lodge a High Court appeal passed in December and the Planning Inspectorate has confirmed that no such application had been received. The family must now comply with the existing demolition order which means that the spa must come down by 7 February. Central Bedfordshire Council has confirmed it will ""review the onsite position on 8 February"". Neither the Captain Tom Foundation nor Ms Ingram-Moore have responded to the BBC's request for comment on the planning application or the subsequent appeal decision. In Ms Ingram-Moore's September 2023 statement, she said no charity money had been used in the construction of the new building. The £38m gained from Capt Tom's walks - managed and distributed by NHS Charities Together - was ""not under investigation"", the charity confirmed. NHS Charities Together said money it received for its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal had ""funded thousands of projects"". It said its appeal had raised more than £160m from thousands of supporters, which had been ""distributed across the network of NHS charities to reach every NHS Trust and Health Board in the UK"". ""It has funded thousands of projects and provided vital mental health support for NHS staff, training for emergency volunteers, equipment and support for patients, and community partnership programmes to prevent ill health and reduce pressure on NHS services,"" the charity said. It has stressed that the Captain Tom Foundation is a ""completely separate organisation"". The September Instagram statement from Ms Ingram-Moore said all the money raised from her father's walk had been given directly to NHS charities and the family had ""never been involved in any discussion or decision on this disbursement"".

Morgan-Rose Hart, 18, who had ADHD, autism and a history of mental illness had been a patient at a unit in Harlow, Essex, for three weeks. An inquest jury concluded she died by misadventure contributed to by neglect. Essex County Council said it would respond to coroner Sonia Hayes' report. Ms Hart, from Chelmsford, died in hospital six days after she was found unresponsive in the bathroom of her mental health accommodation in the Derwent Centre in Harlow, Essex in July 2022. The inquest into her death heard staff observations were falsified and critical observations were missed. In her Prevention of Future Deaths report, Ms Hayes said: ""There is a significant shortfall of appropriate placements for people with autism who have mental health and self-harm risks in Essex both inpatient and in the community."" She added: ""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. ""In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken."" The report has been sent to Essex County Council and Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT). A spokesperson for EPUT, which runs the unit in which Ms Hart was a patient, said: ""Our condolences remain with Morgan-Rose's loved ones following their tragic loss. ""We remain absolutely committed to ensuring improvements are embedded throughout the organisation, so that all patients receive the high quality and compassionate care they deserve. ""We are thoroughly reviewing the coroner's findings and will respond to the report in full in due course."" An Essex County Council spokesperson said: ""We wish to offer our deepest sympathies to Morgan-Rose's family and friends on their sad and tragic loss.

https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67894937,Back-to-school illness advice offered to parents,Parents are being urged to take five simple steps to keep their children healthy as the new school term begins.,2024-01-08,"Parents are being urged to take five simple steps to keep their children healthy as the new school term begins. Advice from health officials ranges from teaching good hygiene habits to stopping the spread of bugs and knowing when to keep your child at home. Winter often sees a rise in common viruses like chickenpox, norovirus and flu which can keep children off school. UK health officials say by following the advice parents can protect them as well as the wider community. Their advice comes as many children return to school for the spring term - but it is also when they are most likely to miss lessons. ""The winter period can see an increase in some of the common seasonal viruses which disrupt children's education and cause more serious illnesses,"" says Dr Catherine Falconer from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The advice is to: 1. Teach good hygiene habits, such as regular hand-washing It is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of viruses, the experts say, because they can live on our hands. Use soap and warm water for 20 seconds or hand sanitiser to clean hands regularly. And to stop infections spreading, use tissues to catch coughs and sneezes, bin them afterwards and then wash hands (again). 2. Stop the spread of stomach bugs Sickness bugs such as norovirus and E. coli are on the up, and that means more children could have diarrhoea and vomiting. If affected, using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will help prevent bugs from spreading (along with washing hands with soap). The UKHSA says not to prepare food for others if you have symptoms, or for 48 hours after they stop. And it advises people to avoid visiting vulnerable relatives in care homes and hospitals to avoid passing anything on to them, and not to return to work, school or nursery until two days after symptoms end. 3. Know when to keep your child at home Children should stay at home from school or nursery if they have a high temperature (fever) and are unwell, and wait until it has passed before going back. A child with diarrhoea and/or vomiting should also wait for 48 hours before going back, to stop the spread of stomach bugs. But if they have a runny nose, sore throat or slight cough - without a high temperature - children are encouraged to go to school, nursery or childcare. Scarlet fever and chickenpox can also spread at this time of year, and cases usually peak in late winter and early spring, health officials say. Scarlet fever symptoms include: Contact your local GP if you see the signs and keep children away from school and nursery for 24 hours after the first dose of antibiotics. Chickenpox is highly contagious - the most common symptom is an itchy, spotty rash. Keep children off school until all the spots have crusted over. 4. Get vaccinated There is a ""quick and painless"" nasal spray for children which offers the best protection against flu, UKHSA says. However, it says vaccine uptake among pre-school children is lower than other groups, despite the illness sometimes being more serious for this age group. Find out if your child is eligible for a flu vaccine in Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There has also been a drop in uptake of other childhood vaccinations, which protect against diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria and polio. The advice is to make sure make sure your child is up to date with all their vaccinations. 5. Take online advice from NHS resources The health service has plenty of advice for parents, such as:","['Primary schools', 'Schools', 'Children', 'Health']","['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/13D77/production/_132217218_gettyimages-612409562.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/EF57/production/_132217216_gettyimages-146860313.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/311B/production/_132217521_gettyimages-138710985.jpg']",['Philippa Roxby'],Health,Health

The BBC spoke to an oral surgery team about this lesser-known cancer, and two women who want to raise awareness of the devastating impact it can have.",2024-01-08,"Some specialists say they are seeing a ""very concerning"" increase in the number of younger patients with mouth cancer - with no obvious explanation as to why. The BBC spoke to an oral surgery team about this lesser-known cancer, and two women who want to raise awareness of the devastating impact it can have. It's 09:30 GMT and the operating theatre is being prepared for Deborah Horsley. She is about to have her eighth operation since finding an ulcer on her tongue in 2009. ""My GP treated it as thrush, but six months later it didn't go, he tried it with something else, then I got sent for a biopsy,"" said Ms Horsley. ""So that's when I found out the first time [that I had cancer]: I was devastated. ""It's now gone on to my gum, so I am having that removed today."" Despite her pre-surgery nerves, Ms Horsley was keen to talk about the disease that has ""taken over"" her life. ""I want to highlight it, because a lot of people don't know about mouth cancer,"" she added. ""If I can help one person that would be good."" Unfortunately, the exploratory operation discovered her cancer had spread to the bone, with Ms Horsley looking at extensive surgery, reconstruction of the lower jaw and possibly radiotherapy as well. According to Cancer Research UK, about 880 people are diagnosed with mouth cancer in the East of England each year, and rates have increased by 26% across England in the past 10 years. The charity said there had been a rise of 13% in cases of oral cancer in the 40-49 age category in England during the same period. It said rates for the age category of 20-39 ""remain steady"". However, Richard James, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for almost two decades, said while his patient numbers appeared unchanged, he was seeing more and more people who did not have the usual risk factors of age, smoking and alcohol. ""We've seen an increasing number of younger patients every year,"" he added. ""Going back over 20 years, we did see a number of patients in their teenage years, but that is relatively small number. ""Patients in their 20s, 30s and 40s - yes, we are seeing an increasing number, which is obviously very concerning. ""We are seeing a number of patients who don't smoke and consume relatively small amounts of alcohol, but the exact reason has never really been determined. ""Maybe there could be some genetic factors, there could be a whole host of reasons. ""Certainly not being able to see dentists, not being able to see primary care could be an issue for a lot of patients and certainly its something that we would like to see corrected. ""The earlier we detect and treat mouth cancer, the better."" Registrar Sarah-Jane Miles was assisting Mr James in theatre, a year after she was diagnosed with tongue cancer. Her treatment was successful and she was able to get back to her training. ""I feel incredibly fortunate - I am working and for a long time I was concerned that may not be a possibility,"" she said. ""I think it gave me a different way of looking at things, from a patient perspective. ""Obviously I have the medical training, but it's different when you are going through things yourself and the challenges you have to overcome to get back to everyday life."" Barbara Fountain, of Norwich, is keen to ensure support is there for people with mouth cancer, particularly for younger patients. She was 32 when she was diagnosed with tongue cancer by Mr James on New Year's Eve 2018, having been referred by her dentist. ""At that moment, everything slowed down,"" she said. ""I looked at my husband's face and it was like shattered glass, and I could see his world completely turned upside down. ""It was only when I met my Macmillan nurse, who touched my arm, that I realised 'oh this is actually happening to me'."" She made a good recovery from a 12-hour operation to remove a quarter of her tongue, which was rebuilt using part of her arm. Five years on from her diagnosis, and she regards herself as ""super lucky"". She set up Young Tongues, initially as a network to help her connect with people like herself. Source: NHS It now links patients around the world and, she hopes, could inspire targeted research. ""Having tongue cancer was an incredibly isolating experience for me, because I didn't have people to relate to,"" she said. ""When I found my first three or four people on Instagram I was really excited, but suddenly we were 100, then we were 500. ""I saw there was a real need for age-appropriate support and to make sure as a young person you feel heard. ""It's really important that as a young person if you have a mouth ulcer or a bump and it's not healing after three weeks that you ask [your GP], and ask again. ""We need money to find out why this increase is happening, and what's driving it so we don't end up with a tongue cancer crisis in 10 or 20 years,"" she added.

""There was no confrontation, there was no chat about what happened... it was just kind of like, 'hey I'm leaving',"" Tolani said. Sharing her side on X/Twitter, Milena said the feud was sparked by a conversation with a third party where she spoke about ""the dynamics of the podcast and how unhappy I was"". But she said the row was ""the cherry on top"" after ""years of a rift between myself and Tolly which was clear to see"". ""To try and play off that I left the bag and something we built over seven years because of one situation doesn't make sense,"" Milena said. Tolly also denied rumours she had bullied Milena, telling listeners: ""One thing I'm not is a bully"", adding she also isn't ""allowed to be a victim"". ""People need a narrative for their world to make sense, there has to be a villain and there has to be a victim. I'm the bad guy so your world makes sense."" Tolly added that she felt ""massively hurt and betrayed"", not wanting things ""to end in this way"". Audrey, who was on maternity leave at the time and has since given birth to her daughter, said she was ""dumbfounded"" by the news of Milena's departure. ""I definitely felt we were owed a lot more respect because regardless of what anyone else says, there was a sisterhood, there was a friendship,"" she said.
